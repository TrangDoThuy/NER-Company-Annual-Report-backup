PART I

Item 1.    BUSINESS

A. General

CDX Corporation is a Colorado corporation
incorporated in 1978 with its corporate offices
headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island.

The Business of the Company has consisted of the sale
of computerized pulmonary diagnostic equipment which
is used in the medical profession to test for
indications of lung or congestive heart disease.
Approximately 11,000 units have been sold.

In December 1994 the Company acquired Compliance
Systems, a manufacturer of infection control
products which provide emergency personnel with
protection during trauma response situations
and assist compliance with certain OSHA mandates.
In FY96 the Company also introduced a new version
of its Instant Response Mask (IRM) with improved
features designed to protect personnel involved
in administering emergency cardio-resuscitation
techniques to compliment the Compliance Systems
product line.  Marketing of the IRM was
discontinued in FY 99.

CDX also generates revenue from the sale of
consumable supplies and accessory items
associated with its diagnostic equipment.  In
addition, the Company procured a new model of
spirometer in FY 99.

B. Products And Services

Approximately 20% of the Company's gross revenues in
its most recent fiscal year was attributable to
the sale of its testing machines, 65% of gross revenues
was attributable to sales of consumable and accessory
items and 7% of gross revenues was attributable to
repairs and testing. Bio-hazard control products
comprised 8% of sales.

The Company's objective is to increase gross revenues
with the introduction of new and upgraded version
of the current spirometer. A new version of the
Instant Response Mask was released in December 1995.
Although initially well received, this product has
not lived up to the Company's expectations and
marketing efforts and expenditures in connection
with it have been curtailed.

The types of products which the Company currently
markets are described below.

1.	CDX SPIRO 850. A new model of spirometer, the
CDX850, was procurred under an exclusive OEM supply
arrangement to replace the CDX Spiro 110's and was
introduced in the beginning of FY 99.  The CDX850
is a portable, compact pulmonary diagnostic machine
utilizing digital electronics and the latest
technology.

2.	CDX SPIRO 110's. The Company previously sold a
line of spirometers(the 110 series) which it
manufactured. Production of the 110 Series
spirometers was curtailed at the end  of FY 98.
The Company continues to support and repair such
spirometers.

Additionally, the Company provides for sale of
disposable and accessory items associated
with its testing equipment as well as maintenance and
service agreements.

3.	Biosponse
A portable bio-hazard spill kit for bloodborne
pathogens which complies with OSHA
regulation.

4.	Biopail
A complete clean up and personal protection for first
responders against blood
pathogens contained in a refillable two gallon pail
meeting OSHA Regulations.

The Company formerly marketed a CPR mask known as the
"Instant Response Mask" or "IRM."
Marketing of the IRM was discontinued in FY98 in an
effort to reduce costs related to
marginal products.



C. Marketing And Customers

The Company's principal customers have historically
been primary care physicians, group
practices, clinic, and medical centers. Portable
spirometers are typically used by
internists, family physicians, and general
practitioners in their offices to conduct
preliminary diagnostic tests of a patients pulmonary
function.  Spirometers are also used
extensively in industry to provide screening
diagnosis, establish baselines and monitor
pulmonary function in the workplace.  The Company's
customer base includes pulmonologists,
allergists, and cardiologists who require the speed,
accuracy, and flexibility of hospital-
based systems in a small, light-weight, portable
system.

During the year ended June 30, 2000, the Company did
not have any one customer responsible
for 10% or more of sales activity or revenues.

The Company currently markets its products directly
to retail customers from its Rhode
Island office and through medical equipment dealers
and distributors, supported through a
network of factory trained manufacturer's
representatives. The Company supports this sales
network through direct mail, advertising in clinical
and trade publications, and
participation in national and regional trade shows.

D. Product Development

In FY 00 the Company terminated its product
development program which was targeted at the
equipment needs of the physician's office to reduce
costs.

E. Products Protection

The company held a patent issued by the U.S. Patent
office in 1981 for the overall
structure and function of its remote pulmonary
function tester known as the CDX 110. The
patent does not apply outside the United States.  The
Company's current products had
protection under certain claims of this patent until
1998. Protection under this patent
lapsed in 1998.

The Company holds a federal trademark "CDX" which is
used on its products.

F. Backlog

The Company does not currently have any backlog of
sales orders or delays of shipments due
to lack of parts or supplies.

G. Competition

The market for the Company's products is
characterized by rapid advancements in technology
and by intense competition among a number of
manufacturers and distributors. The Company
believes that it competes favorably in the market;
however, no assurance can be given that
the Company will have the financial resources,
marketing, distribution, service or support
capabilities, depth of key personnel or technological
expertise to compete successfully in
the future.

H. Employees

As of June 30, 2000, the Company employed no full-
time employees.  All services were
provided to the Company by two independent
contractors, one of which is an affiliate.

Item 2.    PROPERTIES

     In July of 1997 the Company moved its sales
offices and operations to Massachusetts.
In September 1998 the Company moved its  sales
offices and operations to Providence, Rhode
Island.  Currently the Company rents its facilities
on a month to month basis from an
affiliate. Management believes that the rental rates
charged are the same or more favorable
than those which would be available from unaffiliated
third parties. Rental space is
available in the area, and the Company expects to be
able to continue to be able to obtain
adequate space at costs comparable to its current
rent.

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     There are no legal proceedings pending against
the Company.

Item 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF
SECURITY HOLDERS

     The corporation did not submit any matter to a
vote of security holders during the
year ended June 30, 2000.

PART II

Item 5.    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND
RELATED SECURITY HOLDERS MATTERS

     There is no established public trading market
for the Corporation's common stock.  The
stock is traded over-the-counter in privately
negotiated transactions between market makers
and brokers.  Prices are published in the pink sheets
issued by the National Quotation
Bureau, but sales are not systematically reported by
market makers and brokers.

Holders

     Based upon the number of record holders, the
approximate number of shareholders of the
common stock of the Corporation as of June 30, 2000
was 868.

Dividends

     No dividends have been declared during the past
fiscal years with respect to common
stock.

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

     Net Sales and Operating Revenues for FY 00
decreased by $74,935 which is down
approximately 24% from the previous fiscal year.
This compares with an increase of
$54,085, or approximately 20%, in similar figures for
FY 99 to FY 98.  Cost of Sales
decreased by $66,534 for FY 00 compared to FY 99,
with the Company incurring an Operating
Loss of $26,356.  During the previous fiscal year,
Cost of Sales increased by $77,856 from
those of FY 98 resulting in Operating Loss of
$14,900.  FY 98 showed an Operating income of
$84,452. The Operating Loss for FY 00 was 10.7% as a
percentage of Net Sales compared with
Operating Loss of 4.4% for FY 99 and operating income
of 31% for FY 98, respectively. The
decrease in profitability and FY 00 and FY 99 is the
result of higher unit costs and lower
sales. The improvement in operating results for FY 99
was a reflection of reduced costs and
expenses, primarily in the areas of cost of goods,
payroll and rent. Management hopes to
continue its efforts to reduce expenses and keep them
in line with margins and to increase
sales volume.

     Cost of Goods Sold as a percent of Net Sales
decreased from 44.8% ($109,177) in FY 00
from 53.3% (169,711) in FY 99 due primarily to
decreased sales. Similar costs for FY 98 to
FY 99 increased from 34.4% ($91,855) in FY 98 to
53.1% ($169,711) in FY 99.

     Selling and Administrative Expenses decreased
overall by $26,241, to $130,925 for FY
00 from $157,166 for FY 99.  As a percentage of Net
Sales these figures were 53.5% and
49.38% respectively which represents a 17.2% decrease
in such expenses between the two
years.  Comparable expenses for FY 98 were 57.1%
($162,303).  The increase in percentages
of expenses shown in FY 00 over FY 99 reflects a
decrease in Net Sales without a
corresponding decrease in expenses.

     Interest expense for FY 00 increased to $29,581
from $21,863 for FY 99.  In FY 99,
interest expense decreased $1,213.  Interest income
was immaterial for FY 99 and 00.

     Inflation has had a minimum impact upon the
Revenues and Costs of the Company.

Liquidity And Capital Resources

     In fiscal year 2000, the Company's liquidity
decreased by $11,875. This compares with
a decreased position of $3,257 in FY 99.  The FY 00
increase primarily reflects the impact
of an increase in cash provided by operations for FY
00 of $9,219 versus cash from
operations of $2,656 in FY 99.
     The Company expects that its current working
capital position is sufficient to
continue to meet operating requirements during the
coming fiscal year and that it has
sufficient reserves to meet some unforeseen
contingencies given a continued willingness on
the part of several of its officers to fund deficits
with loans.

Stock Option Plan

     In November, 1987, the Shareholders of the
Corporation approved an incentive stock
option plan which provides that options may be
granted to officers and employees, with a
maximum aggregate number of 150,000 shares issuable
under the plan.  Shares underlying
granted options are exercisable 25% on the date of
grant and 25% each year thereafter on a
cumulative basis.  Unexercised options lapse ten
years after the date of grant or expire
within 90 days of termination of employment.
Exercise price is fair market value of a
share of common stock at date of grant.  The plan has
a term of ten years.

     In November 1987, the Directors of the
Corporation approved a Non-Qualified Stock
Option Plan for employees, consultants and directors.
The Corporation has reserved 60,000
unregistered shares of its common stock for use in
this plan.  During 1993, the Board of
Directors reserved another 1,440,000 unregistered
shares of its common stock for use in
this plan.  Each of the four outside directors were
granted options for 15,000 shares at
$.10 per share exercisable during their continuation
as an employee, director or advisory
member of, or consultant to the Company, and for the
three year period thereafter.  In
addition, during 1993, the Company granted one of its
directors options for 250,000 shares
at $.10 per share and granted one of its consultants
options for 77,800 shares at $.05 per
share.  The options on 60,000 shares @$.10 per share
granted to outside directors and
77,800 shares @$.05 granted to a consultant have
expired unexercised.

     In December 1992, the Company issued 600,000
warrants for its common stock to certain
of its officers and consultants in return for
services.  The warrants are exercisable at
$.02 per share with an expiration date of December
31, 1998.   Also, in February 1995, the

loan.  The warrants are divided into three equal
classes with exercise prices of $0.25,

modified and extended so that all series of warrants
issued prior to December 31, 1998
shall expire as of December 31, 2001.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT





To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
CDX Corporation
We have audited the balance sheets of CDX Corporation
as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, and the
related statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for the years ended June 30,
2000,
1999, and 1998.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable
basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of CDX Corporation as of June 30,
2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2000,
1999, and 1998 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 12
to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a
net capital deficiency, which raises substantial
doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans regarding those matters are also
described in Note 12.  The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from
this
uncertainty.

CDX CORPORATION

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000, 1999, 1998


1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	Background

		CDX Corporation (the Company) was
incorporated in June, 1978 to engage in
the manufacture and sale of computerized pulmonary
diagnostic equipment used in the
medical profession.  This equipment tests for
indications of lung or congestive heart
disease.  The Company also manufactures and sells
other medical and sanitization
equipment.


	Invention Rights

	In July of 1997, an updated version of the
Spirosource, a technological
enhancement to its computerized pulmonary diagnostic
equipment, became available for
sale to the public.  For financial accounting
purposes, this product has been recorded at
cost, amortized on a straight-line basis over an
estimated useful life of five years.  The
Three-Liter Calibration Syringe was also developed
and made available for sale to the
public during the year.  It has also been recorded at
cost and amortized on a straight-line
basis over an estimated useful life of five years.


	Revenue Recognition

		Revenue is recognized upon the invoicing
and shipping of equipment.


	Cash and Cash Equivalents

		The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with a maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

	At June 30, 1999, the carrying amount of the
Company's deposits was $10,259
and the bank balance was $20,621, of which all was
covered by federal depository
insurance.

	At June 30, 2000, the carrying amount of the
Company's deposits was $21,834
and the bank balance was $36,629, of which all was
covered by federal depository
insurance.

	At June 30, 2000, the carrying value of
deposits of $21,834 and petty cash funds
relate to the Balance Sheet as follows:

Cash deposits		$21,834
Add:  petty cash		      300
Cash		$22,134


	Accounts Receivable

		An allowance for doubtful accounts
receivable is provided equal to the estimated
collection losses that will be incurred in collection
of all receivables.  Estimated losses are
based on historical collection experience coupled
with review of the current status of the
existing receivables and amounted to $1,260 at June
30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The Company grants credit to customers who are
located throughout the United States.

YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000, 1999, AND 1998


1.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(Continued)

	Inventories

		Inventories are valued at the lower of
cost or market using the first-in, first-out
method.


	Property and Equipment

		Property and equipment are recorded at
cost.  Depreciation and amortization are
recorded using the straight line and double declining
balance methods over the estimated
useful lives of the assets.

		The estimated useful lives of property
and equipment are as follows:

	Office furniture		7 years
	Office equipment		5 years
	Production equipment		5 years
	Computer equipment		5 years
	Leasehold improvements		31.5 years


	Income Taxes

		Effective July 1, 1993, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FAS 109).
Under the provisions of FAS 109, an
entity recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the future tax consequences of
events that have been previously recognized in the
Company's financial statements or
tax returns.  The measurement of deferred tax assets
and liabilities is based on
provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of
future changes in tax laws or rates are
not anticipated.  The adoption of FAS 109 did not
have an effect on the Company's
financial statements, nor have any prior year
financial statements been restated.


	Per Share Data

		Loss per common share was computed by
dividing the net loss by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding
and common stock equivalents
(unless antidilutive) during the periods.

The weighted average number of shares of common stock
were 4,887,927
shares at June 30, 2000 and 1999.

	Use of Estimates

	The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

4.	INCOME TAXES

Due primarily to the utilization of net operating
loss carryforwards, the Company
has no provisions for income taxes for 2000, 1999,
and 1998.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of
temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  The
Company's net deferred tax asset
balances are primarily attributable to net operating
loss carryforwards and tax credits.  At
June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, the Company's deferred
tax assets consisted of the
following:



		2000	1999	1998

	Deferred tax assets		$593,480
	$597,289	$680,712
	Valuation allowance		 (593,480)
	(597,289)	(680,712)

11.	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

		The Company is engaged primarily in the
distribution of specialized medical
equipment in North America.  The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition and, generally,
requires no collateral from its customers.

		Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of trade accounts
receivable.  Concentrations of credit risk
with respect to trade receivables are limited due to
the number of customers comprising
the customer base and their dispersion across
geographic areas.

		The carrying amounts reflected in the
balance sheets for cash and notes payable
approximate the respective fair values due to the
short maturities of those instruments.



12.	FUTURE OPERATIONS

		The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles, which
contemplate continuation of the
Company as a going concern.  However, the Company
suffered losses of $26,356 and
$14,980 during the years ended June 30, 2000 and
1999, respectively.  In addition, the
Company has a net stockholders' deficiency of
$548,062 at June 30, 2000.

	Management continues to look for opportunities
in manufacturing new products
in the medical field.  Management is also seeking to
merge with companies with products
and/or services compatible with the Company's core
business.

		The Company is in the process of
developing new and innovative products for
the physician's marketplace.  Management plans to
develop upgrades and improvements
to existing products utilizing state of the art
technology and to remarket these products to
its substantial existing client base.



13.	SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

	On September 7, 2000, the Corporation entered
into a promissory note payable
with a related party in the amount of $10,000.  This
note bears an interest rate of 9.5%
per year and is due on or before December 7, 2000.
