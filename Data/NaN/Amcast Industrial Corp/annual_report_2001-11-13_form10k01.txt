                                     PART I

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

Amcast Industrial Corporation, an Ohio corporation incorporated in 1869, and its
subsidiaries (called collectively  "Amcast" or the "Company") are engaged in the
business of  producing  fabricated  metal  products  and cast and tubular  metal
products  in a  variety  of  shapes,  sizes,  and  metals  for sale to end users
directly,  through sales representatives and distributor  organizations,  and to
original equipment manufacturers.  The Company serves three major sectors of the
economy: automotive,  construction, and industrial. Manufacturing facilities are
located in the United States of America, primarily in the Midwest, and in Italy.

During fiscal 1998, the Company acquired Lee Brass Company, located in Anniston,
Alabama; ceased operations at Flagg Brass, Inc., located in Stowe, Pennsylvania;
and during fiscal 1999,  sold Superior  Valve  Company,  located in  Washington,
Pennsylvania.  See further  discussion in "Flow Control Products" below.  During
fiscal  1997,  the Company  acquired all of the  outstanding  stock of Speedline
S.p.A. and its subsidiaries  (Speedline),  a major European manufacturer located
in Italy, and during fiscal 1998, sold Amcast Precision  Products Inc. in Rancho
Cucamonga,  California.  During fiscal 2001, the Company purchased the remaining
40% share in Casting  Technology  Company  (CTC),  from Izumi  Industries,  LTD,
bringing  total  ownership  to  100%.  See  further  discussion  in  "Engineered
Components" below.

The Company  operates in two business  segments -- (1) Flow Control Products and
(2)  Engineered  Components.  Information  concerning  the net sales,  operating
profit,  and  identifiable  assets of each segment and sales by product category
for years 1999 through 2001 appears  under  "Business  Segments" in the Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  pages 37-38 herein.  Domestic export sales
were $15.5 million,  $16.1 million,  and $18.0 million in fiscal 2001, 2000, and
1999, respectively.

FLOW CONTROL PRODUCTS

The Flow Control  Products  segment (Flow  Control)  includes the  businesses of
Elkhart Products Corporation  (Elkhart),  Elkhart Industrial (Geneva), Lee Brass
Company (Lee Brass), and Amcast Industrial Ltd. Elkhart produces a complete line
of wrot copper  fittings  for use in  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial
construction  and markets  brass pipe  fittings  and cast and  fabricated  metal
products for sale to original  equipment  manufacturers  in the  transportation,
construction,  air  conditioning  and  refrigeration  industries.  Geneva custom
fabricates copper and aluminum tubular parts. Lee Brass  manufactures cast brass
products for residential, commercial, and industrial plumbing systems as well as
specific cast brass components  unique to the application of original  equipment
manufacturers.  Amcast Industrial Ltd. is the Canadian marketing channel for the
Company's Flow Control segment manufacturing units.

The Flow  Control  Products  segment is a leading  supplier  of copper and brass
fittings for the industrial,  commercial,  and residential construction markets.
These  products are sold through  distributors  and  wholesalers.  Shipments are
primarily  made by truck from  Company  locations  directly  to  customers.  The
competition  is  comprised  of a  number  of  manufacturers  of  parts  for  air
conditioning,  refrigeration,  and plumbing  systems.  The Company believes that
competition  in this segment is based on a number of factors  including  product
quality, service, delivery, and value.

The Flow  Control  Products  segment is one of three major  suppliers  of copper
fittings to the North American industrial,  commercial, and residential plumbing
markets.  Products  are sold  primarily  through  plumbing  wholesalers,  retail
hardware stores and home centers,  and to original  equipment  manufacturers and
replacement   parts   distributors  in  the  air   conditioning  and  commercial
refrigeration  business.  Competition is based on service levels,  pricing,  and
breadth of  product  offering.  The  Company's  prime  competitors  are  Mueller
Industries,  Inc.,  a  publicly-owned  company  listed  on the  New  York  Stock
Exchange,  and NIBCO Inc., a  privately-held  company  headquartered in Elkhart,
Indiana. Both Mueller Industries, Inc. and NIBCO Inc. may have greater financial
resources than the Company.

On April 9, 1998,  the Company  acquired Lee Brass  Company,  a  privately-owned
company located in Anniston,  Alabama. Lee Brass is a major manufacturer of cast
brass products for residential,  commercial,  and industrial  plumbing  systems.
Following the acquisition of Lee Brass,  the Company  consolidated its two brass
foundry  operations  and ceased  production  at its Flagg Brass plant located in
Stowe,  Pennsylvania.  The  consolidation  plan included the transfer of certain
product  lines to Lee Brass,  the closure of the Flagg Brass  facility,  and the
termination of approximately 100 salaried and hourly personnel.

<PAGE>

On October 16, 1998,  the Company sold Superior  Valve  Company.  This business,
acquired by Amcast in 1986,  produces  specialty valves and related products for
the compressed gas and commercial refrigeration markets.

The  majority  of the  Flow  Control  Products  segment's  business  is based on
customer purchase orders for their current product requirements. Such orders are
filled  from   inventory   positions   maintained  in  the  regional   warehouse
distribution network. In certain situations, longer-term supply arrangements are
in place with major customers.  Such arrangements are of the type that stipulate
a  certain  percentage  of the  customer's  requirements  to be  delivered  at a
specific price over a set period of time.  Such  arrangements  are beneficial to
the  Company  in that they  provide  firm  forecasts  of demand  that  allow for
efficient use of equipment and manpower.

See  Properties  at Item 2 of  this  report  for  information  on the  Company's
facilities that operate in this segment.

ENGINEERED COMPONENTS

The Engineered  Components  segment  produces cast and fabricated metal products
principally for sale to original equipment  manufacturers and tier-one suppliers
in the automotive industry.  The Company's  manufacturing  processes involve the
melting  of  raw   materials  for  casting  into  metal   products   having  the
configuration,  flexibility,  strength,  weight,  and  finish  required  for the
customer's  end use.  The Company  manufactures  products on a  high-volume  and
specialized  basis and its metal  capabilities  include  aluminum and magnesium.
Products  manufactured by the North American  operations of this segment include
aluminum  castings  for  suspension,  air  conditioning  and  anti-lock  braking
systems,  master  cylinders,  differential  carriers,  brake  calipers  and cast
aluminum wheels for use on automobiles  and light trucks.  Delivery is mostly by
truck  from  Amcast  locations   directly  to  customers.   Principal   products
manufactured by Speedline,  in Italy, include aluminum wheels for passenger cars
and trucks.  Speedline also  manufactures  aluminum and magnesium racing wheels,
aftermarket wheels, modular wheels, and hubcaps.

The Engineered  Components segment is not solely dependent on a single customer;
however, a significant portion of the Engineered Components business is directly
or indirectly dependent on the automobile  manufacturing industry. The Company's
net sales to  various  divisions  of  General  Motors  Corporation  were  $127.3
million,  $157.1  million,  and $136.5 million for fiscal 2001,  2000, and 1999,
respectively.  No other  customer  accounted  for more than 10% of  consolidated
sales.

The Engineered  Components segment is a leading supplier of aluminum  automotive
components and aluminum wheels for automotive  original equipment  manufacturers
in  North  America  and  also a  leading  supplier  of  light-alloy  wheels  for
automotive  original  equipment  manufacturers  and aftermarket  applications in
Europe.  Competition  in the  automotive  components  industry  is  global  with
numerous  competitors.   The  basis  of  competition  is  generally  design  and
engineering capability, price, product quality, and delivery.

There are  approximately  25  competitors in the aluminum  automotive  component
business serving the North American market. Principal competitors include Alcoa;
Hayes Lemmerz International,  Inc.; Stahl Specialty Company, a subsidiary of the
Budd Co.; Contech,  a subsidiary of SPX Corporation;  and Citation  Corporation;
some of which have significantly greater financial resources than the Company.

There are  approximately  18 producers of aluminum wheels that service the North
American  market.  The largest of these are Superior  Industries  International,
Inc. and Hayes Lemmerz  International,  Inc. The next tier of suppliers includes
the Company,  Alcoa, and Enkei America Inc. Some of the Company's competitors in
the aluminum wheel business have significantly  greater financial resources than
the Company.

There are approximately 15 competitors in the aluminum and magnesium  automotive
wheel business serving the European market.  Principal competitors include Hayes
Lemmerz  International,  Inc., Ronal, ATS, and Alloy Wheels International (AWI),
some of which  may  have  significantly  greater  financial  resources  than the
Company.

The Company  operates on a "blanket"  order basis and generally  supplies all of
the customer's annual  requirements for a particular part.  Customers issue firm
releases  and  shipping  schedules  each  month  against  their  blanket  orders
depending on their current needs.  As a result,  order backlog varies from month
to month and is not considered firm beyond a 30-day period.

<PAGE>


Effective  March 30,  1998,  the Company  sold Amcast  Precision  Products  Inc.
(Precision),  its Rancho  Cucamonga,  California  casting  operation.  Precision
produced ferrous and  nonferrous castings for the aerospace industry.   This was
Amcast's only operation in the aerospace industry.

See  Properties  at Item 2 of  this  report  for  information  on the  Company's
facilities that operate in this segment.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Aluminum  and  copper,  the  essential  raw  materials  to  the  business,   are
commodity-based  metals  purchased  from worldwide  sources of supply.  Supplier
selection is based upon quality, delivery,  reliability, and price. Availability
of these materials is judged to be adequate. The Company does not anticipate any
material shortage that will alter production schedules during the coming year.

Aluminum  and  copper are basic  commodities  traded in  international  markets.
Changes in aluminum, copper, and brass costs are generally passed through to the
customer. In North America, changes in the cost of aluminum are currently passed
through  to the  customer  based on  various  formulas  as is the  custom in the
automotive industry sector the Company serves. In Europe, changes in the cost of
aluminum  are  currently  passed  through  to  approximately  two-thirds  of the
customers based upon various formulas and through negotiated  contracts with the
remaining customers. Copper and brass cost increases and decreases are generally
passed  through to the  customer in the form of price  changes as  permitted  by
prevailing  market  conditions.  The Company is unable to project  whether these
costs will  increase or decrease in the future.  The  Company's  ability to pass
through any increased  costs to the customer in the future will be determined by
market conditions at that time.

The  Company  owns a number of patents and patent  applications  relating to the
design of its products.  While the Company considers that in the aggregate these
patents are important to operations, it believes that the successful manufacture
and sale of its products  generally  depend more on the Company's  technological
know-how and manufacturing skills.

Capital  expenditures  related to  compliance  with  federal,  state,  and local
environmental  protection  regulations for fiscal 2002 and 2003 are not expected
to  be  material.   Management   believes  that   operating   costs  related  to
environmental  protection  will not have a materially  adverse  effect on future
earnings or the Company's competitive position in the industry.

The Company employed  approximately 4,000, 4,530, and 4,960 associates at August
31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

In general,  sales and  production in the  automotive  industry are cyclical and
vary based on the timing of consumer  purchases of vehicles and overall economic
strength. Production schedules can vary significantly from quarter to quarter to
meet customer demands.

      Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995

Certain statements in this Report, in the Company's press releases,  and in oral
statements  made by or with the approval of an authorized  executive  officer of
the  Company  constitute  "forward-looking  statements"  as that term is defined
under the Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995. These may include
statements  projecting,  forecasting,  or  estimating  Company  performance  and
industry trends. The achievement of the projections,  forecasts, or estimates is
subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results and events may differ
materially from those  projected,  forecasted,  or estimated.  Factors which may
cause  actual  results  to differ  materially  from  those  contemplated  by the
forward-looking  statement include,  among others:  general economic  conditions
less  favorable than expected,  fluctuating  demand in the automotive  industry,
less favorable than expected growth in sales and profit margins in the Company's
product  lines,  increased  competitive  pressures in the  Company's  Engineered
Components  and Flow Control  Products  segments,  effectiveness  of  production
improvement  plans,  inherent  uncertainties  in connection  with  international
operations and foreign currency  fluctuations and labor relations at the Company
and its customers.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Certain legal matters are described at "Commitments  and  Contingencies"  in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, pages 31-32 herein.

Allied  Signal,  Inc.  (now  Honeywell  International)  has  brought a superfund
private cost recovery and contribution  action against the Company in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, which
is captioned  Allied-Signal,  Inc. V. Amcast  Industrial  Corporation  (Case No.
C-3-92-013).  The action involves the Goldcamp  Disposal Site in Ironton,  Ohio.
Honeywell  International  has  taken  the lead in  remediating  the site and has
estimated  that its total  costs  for the  remediation  may  reach $30  million.
Honeywell  International is seeking a contribution from the Company in an amount
equal to 50% of the final  remediation  costs.  A trial in this  proceeding  was
completed  in February  1995.  The trial court  recently  entered a "short form"
opinion on the merits.  The Court stated that the Company is responsible  for 2%
of  Honeywell  International's  past and  future  clean-up  costs,  and that the
Company  is  responsible  for  28% of the  costs  that  Honeywell  International
incurred to place a "cap" on the Goldcamp  Disposal site. The Court also ordered
the  Company to pay  pre-judgment  interest.  Based on the Court's  action,  the
Company  estimates  that its  maximum  liability  associated  with the action is
between $0.5 million and $1.5 million. The Court has not entered a "final" order
and any final  order  could be subject  to  appeal.  The  Company  believes  its
liability is at the low end of this range.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
         ($ in thousands except per share amounts)

Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995

Certain statements in this Report, in the Company's press releases,  and in oral
statements  made by or with the approval of an authorized  executive  officer of
the  Company  constitute  "forward-looking  statements"  as that term is defined
under the Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995. These may include
statements  projecting,  forecasting,  or  estimating  Company  performance  and
industry trends. The achievement of the projections,  forecasts, or estimates is
subject to certain  risks and  uncertainties  and actual  results and events may
differ materially from those projected,  forecasted, or estimated. Factors which
may cause actual results to differ  materially  from those  contemplated  by the
forward-looking  statement,  include,  among others: general economic conditions
less  favorable  than  expected,  the  ability of the  Company to  negotiate  an
extension of its waivers with its lenders,  fluctuating demand in the automotive
and housing  industry,  less favorable than expected  growth in sales and profit
margins in

<PAGE>

the  Company's  product  lines,  price  pressures  in the  Company's  Engineered
Components  and Flow Control  Products  segments,  effectiveness  of  production
improvement  plans,  inherent  uncertainties  in connection  with  international
operations  and  foreign  currency   fluctuations  and  labor  availability  and
relations  at the  Company  and its  customers.  The  following  discussion  and
analysis  provides  information  which  management  believes  is  relevant to an
understanding of the Company's  consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.  This discussion  should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Business Segments

Operating  segments are organized  internally  primarily by the type of products
produced and markets  served,  and in accordance  with SFAS No. 131, the Company
has aggregated  similar operating  segments into two reportable  segments:  Flow
Control Products and Engineered Components. The Flow Control Products segment is
a supplier of copper and brass plumbing fittings for the industrial, commercial,
and residential construction markets, and cast and fabricated metal products for
sale to original equipment  manufacturers in the  transportation,  construction,
air  conditioning,  and  refrigeration  industries.  The  Engineered  Components
segment is a supplier of aluminum wheels and aluminum components,  primarily for
automotive   original   equipment   manufacturers.   During  2001,  the  Company
reevaluated  the  composition of the reportable  segments and  reclassified  one
business from Engineered Components to Flow Control Products. Prior year segment
information was restated to conform to the 2001 presentation.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

During  1999  and  2001 the  Company  completed  transactions  that  impact  the
Company's  financial  results for those years and affect the comparison  between
2001,  2000,  and 1999. In October 1998, the Company sold Superior Valve Company
(Superior)  for $35,604 in cash.  The  transaction  resulted in a pretax gain of
$9,023.  Results for 1999  included  sales for Superior  Valve of  approximately
$4,600 in the Company's Flow Control segment.

Effective  June 5, 2001,  the Company  purchased the remaining 40% share in CTC,
from Izumi Industries, LTD, bringing total ownership to 100%. The purchase price
was approximately  $4,000 of which $2,000 is payable in annual installments over
the next five years.  No  goodwill  was  recognized  from the  transaction.  The
financial  results  of CTC are  included  as part of the  Engineered  Components
segment in the  consolidated  financial  statements  since the  purchase  of the
remaining 40% share.

Unusual Items

In October 2000, the Company  announced that it had hired financial  advisors to
assist  the  Company  in  exploring   strategic   alternatives   for  maximizing
shareholder  value.  This process  included  evaluating the possible sale of the
business, various business combinations,  and several break-up scenarios. During
2001,  the Company  incurred  unusually  high  expenditures  for legal and other
professional fees in conjunction with the strategic  alternative  review.  After
careful consideration,  in early February 2001, the Company's Board of Directors
reached a decision that, even in the currently  weakened market  environment,  a
stronger  pursuit of the Company's  fundamental  strategy  would,  over the long
term,  better  serve the  shareholders  and  concluded  the review of  strategic
alternatives.  At the same time,  the Company's  Board of Directors made several
senior  management  changes that would provide the leadership needed to move the
Company  forward which resulted in additional  expense for severance and related
costs.

Due to operating  losses incurred  during the second quarter,  at March 4, 2001,
the Company was not in compliance with certain non-monetary  covenants under its
credit agreement (the Revolver Agreement). This resulted in a cross violation in
the  Company's  Senior  Note  Agreement  (the  Senior  Notes)  and  the  Casting
Technology  Credit  Agreement  (the CTC  Agreement)  of which  the  Company  had
guaranteed  $14,094.  As more  fully  discussed  under  "Liquidity  and  Capital
Resources",  the  Company has entered  into a new credit  agreement  (the Credit
Agreement),  and at the same time,  received waivers of the covenant  violations
under the Revolver Agreement,  Senior Notes, and the CTC Agreement through April
15, 2002. The Company incurred significant costs related to obtaining the Credit
Agreement and the waivers.

<PAGE>

In the last half of fiscal 2001, the new  management of the Company  initiated a
strategic review of the Company in light of its weak markets and relatively poor
operating  performance.  As a result,  management  decided to dispose of certain
under-utilized  machinery,  tooling and equipment;  to scrap certain slow moving
inventories;   and  to  increase  the   allowance   for  doubtful  and  disputed
receivables.  In addition to establishing  reserves for these items, the unusual
items also included increases in workers compensation and certain other reserves
for previously closed facilities, increases in environmental reserves, and other
accrual  adjustments.  Additionally,  due  to  past  operating  results  at  the
Company's  European  operations,  in  compliance  with  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No.  109.,  the Company  increased  its  valuation
allowance against certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.

These unusual  items totaled  $26,868  ($20,069,  net of tax). In addition,  the
Company's  share of CTC's  unusual  charges  prior to June 5,  2001,  which  are
included in Other Income and Expense, was $1,267 ($803, net of tax).  Management
of the Company does not anticipate that there will be any significant additional
charges of this nature in the near future.

Results of Operations

Consolidated net sales in 2001 were $529,373,  which  represented a $81,282,  or
13.3%, decrease from 2000.  Consolidated net sales in 2000 were $610,655,  which
represented a $21,722,  or 3.7%,  increase over 1999. The following  table shows
the components of the changes in the Company's consolidated net sales.

                                          2001        2000        1999

Foreign currency exchange rates          (3.2)%      (3.9)%       3.0 %
                                        -------     -------     -------
Total Sales Growth                      (13.3)%       3.7 %       2.5 %
                                        -------     -------     -------

In 2001,  consolidated  net sales  decreased  to  $529,373.  The volume  decline
experienced in 2001 reflects  decreased  automotive  production in North America
during  2001,  auto  manufacturer's  new model  launch  delays in Europe,  and a
slowness in construction markets for a portion of the year. North American light
vehicle  production  was down 9.7% year over year while U.S. light vehicle sales
were down 3.7% during the same  period.  The impact of a favorable  product mix,
primarily at the Company's  European  operations,  helped negate the unfavorable
pricing that resulted from competitive  market pricing issues encountered in the
Flow Control  Products  segment.  The  inclusion  of CTC for the fourth  quarter
increased  sales while a weaker Italian lira caused a decrease in sales from the
prior year. By segment,  Engineered  Components  sales decreased 14.5% primarily
due to low vehicle build in the Company's major North American market while Flow
Control  Products sales decreased 10.1% primarily due to competitive  pricing in
the Company's markets.

In 2000,  consolidated  net sales  increased to $610,655.  Volume growth in 2000
reflects  increased  sales  of  the  Company's   performance-critical   aluminum
components  and European  wheels  partly  offset by a decline in North  American
wheel sales and by lower volumes in the Flow Control Products segment. Favorable
pricing  includes a better  product  mix,  primarily at the  Company's  European
operations, and higher aluminum costs reflected in the sales price of automotive
products.  These gains were  partially  offset by a reduction  in sales from the
sale of Superior and by a weaker Italian lira. By segment, Engineered Components
sales  increased  7.8%  primarily  due to volume gains  related to the increased
aluminum  component  sales while Flow  Control  Products  sales  decreased  5.8%
primarily due to the loss of two significant  customers and decreased sales from
divested operations.

Gross  profit  was  $40,793,  $78,694,  and  $93,025  in 2001,  2000,  and 1999,
respectively.  As a percentage of sales,  gross profit decreased to 7.7% in 2001
from 12.9% in 2000 and 15.8% in 1999.  The  Company's  decision to scrap certain
slow  moving  inventories  resulted  in unusual  items of $5,070  for  inventory
write-offs in 2001. Excluding the unusual items, the gross profit percentage was
8.7% for 2001. In the Flow Control  Products  segment,  pricing  issues were the
primary reason for the decrease in gross profit while  significantly lower sales
volume and a weaker  Italian  lira led to the  decrease  in gross  profit in the
Engineered  Components segment.  During the last half of the year, management of
the  Company  began to focus on  reducing  inventories.  Even though the Company
began to

<PAGE>

experience  a drop in  sales  early in the  year,  inventory  continued  to rise
because production continued at plan levels, reaching a peak at midyear.

Since February, the Company has reduced inventory  significantly;  however, this
had a negative  impact on gross profit due to lost  absorption.  Gross profit of
businesses  in both  segments  also suffered from higher energy costs during the
winter months.

A combination of internal and external factors affected gross profit in 2000. In
the Flow Control  Products  segment,  large volume  losses  associated  with two
customers  at Lee Brass  depressed  gross  profit.  In  addition,  this  segment
experienced sporadic,  intense price competition that prevented the Company from
passing  higher  copper costs on to its  customers.  The flow control  units did
respond  positively to the Company-wide cost reduction program initiated earlier
in the year that partially offset the copper cost and competitive market pricing
issues. In the Engineered Components segment,  reduced sales volumes for certain
aluminum wheel styles,  coupled with high associate  turnover at one wheel plant
during the first half of the year,  had a negative  impact on gross  profit.  In
North America,  the Company  purchased  tooling and reserved capacity to produce
wheels for three vehicles that experienced  less than anticipated  sales volume.
Also negatively  impacting gross profit in 2000 was the  continuation of some of
the operating issues encountered in the previous year. In the last half of 1999,
the Company  experienced higher than expected costs and lower product yields due
to high  turnover of skilled labor in two Indiana wheel plants and to the launch
of new suspension products at the Company's  Wapakoneta,  Ohio plant. The launch
proved to be very  difficult and was  accompanied by high labor  turnover,  high
scrap, low  productivity,  and significant  costs to ensure an adequate customer
supply.  In Europe, a negative  currency  impact,  the inability to pass through
certain  material costs,  and a factory  expansion  temporarily  depressed gross
profit. The cost of aluminum is a significant component of the overall cost of a
wheel. While the aluminum content of selling prices is periodically adjusted for
current  market  conditions,  the purchasing  practices and pricing  formulas of
certain  customers of the Company's  European  operations  prevented the Company
from reacting  quickly enough to the sharp rise in aluminum  prices early in the
year.  Additionally,  the Company  expanded  and  rearranged  one of its Italian
plants to increase output and better balance  production flow.  During this time
period, this facility  experienced very high labor turnover which,  coupled with
the expansion  process,  had a negative  effect on production  and gross profit.
Several  factors  had a  positive  impact  on gross  profit  in 2000.  Effective
September  1,  1999,  the  depreciable   lives  of  certain  assets  of  foreign
subsidiaries  were  changed  based  upon a  study  performed  by an  independent
appraisal  company.  The effect of this change was a reduction  of  depreciation
expense of  approximately  $2,400.  During  2000,  the Company  also changed its
method for  accounting for supplies and spare parts  inventories.  The effect of
this  change,  which is  discussed  more  fully on the  following  page,  was to
increase gross profit in 2000 by approximately $400.

Selling,  general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $71,183, $57,137, and
$55,938 in 2001, 2000, and 1999,  respectively.  As a percentage of sales,  SG&A
expenses increased to 13.4% in 2001 compared with 9.4% in 2000 and 9.5% in 1999.
Unusual items recorded in 2001 in SG&A expense  totaled  $20,504.  Excluding the
unusual  items,  SG&A expense was $50,679 or 9.6%. The decrease in SG&A expenses
for 2001 reflects a higher net pension expense  benefit than in 2000,  partially
due  to  a  change  in  the  discount  rate,  lower  legal  costs,  and  reduced
compensation  expense due to the salaried  workforce  reduction that occurred in
the middle of fiscal 2000.

SG&A expense in 2000 includes a net pension expense benefit of $2,546  primarily
as a result of improvement in the defined  benefit pension plan's funded status,
a one-half  percentage point increase in the expected return on plan assets, and
the change to a defined  benefit  cash  balance  pension  plan.  Prior year SG&A
expense  also  includes  the  benefit  of the  reversal  of a  $2,226  liability
resulting  from the  favorable  settlement of a legal claim against the Company.
Previously,  the Company had recorded a liability for a legal claim  asserted by
former employees at its Flagg Brass operations. Due to the terms of a settlement
reached  during 2000 relative to this  obligation,  this  liability was reversed
through a reduction in SG&A expense. SG&A expense was also favorably impacted by
the results of the Company's cost reduction  program initiated at the end of its
second quarter. In early March, the Company implemented an 8% salaried workforce
reduction across all of its North American operations.  At the same time, global
restrictions  were placed on other  controllable  operating  and  administrative
costs.  Higher  commissions,  legal costs, and information  system  expenditures
offset these reductions in SG&A expense.

Prior to acquiring  the  remaining  40%  ownership,  CTC was a joint venture and
financial  results were  recorded  using the equity  method of  accounting.  The
Company's  pretax share of losses from CTC while a joint  venture,  were $3,122,
$3,528,  and  $1,452  in 2001,  2000,  and  1999,  respectively.  As  previously
mentioned,  CTC also recorded  unusual items in 2001,  primarily to increase the
allowancefor  doubtful and disputed  receivables and to write down inventory and
tooling.  Excluding  these unusual  items,  the Company's  pretax share of CTC's
losses was $1,855.  While the demand and capacity issues CTC experienced in 2000
subsided in 2001, there were some carryover  effects in the form of higher costs
and  manufacturing  inefficiencies  early in the year and lower volumes later in
the year that negatively  impacted the results for 2001.  CTC's results for 2000
were severely impacted by a customer's

<PAGE>

extraordinarily high, temporary demand. In the second half of 2000, particularly
the fourth  quarter,  CTC was pushed beyond  capacity and incurred  higher costs
associated with operating in excess of capacity to meet the customer's demand.

Interest  expense was $17,532 in 2001,  $12,929 in 2000, and $13,182 in 1999. As
further discussed under "Liquidity and Capital Resources", interest rates on the
Company's borrowings under the Prior Agreement and the Senior Notes increased in
the last half of fiscal  2001.  The Company  will  continue  with a  substantial
interest burden until lower-cost financing can be put in place.

The effective tax rates for 2001,  2000, and 1999 were 25.1%,  38.0%, and 38.8%,
respectively.  The  effective  tax rate  recorded for fiscal 2001  represents an
income  tax  benefit,  whereas  the  rates  recorded  for  fiscal  2000 and 1999
represents  an income tax expense.  The decrease in the  effective  tax rate for
fiscal 2001 was caused  primarily by the  requirement  to increase the valuation
allowance  against foreign net operating  losses by $3,048 due to past operating
results at the Company's European operations. As of August 31, 2001, the Company
has recorded a valuation  allowance of $13,401,  of which $7,155  relates to the
net operating loss carryforwards  associated with the purchase of the remainging
40%  share  of CTC  and  $6,246  is  associated  with  foreign  operations.  For
additional  information  regarding the provision for income taxes as well as the
difference  between  effective  and  statutory  tax  rates,  see  the  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2000, the Company implemented portions of an enterprise resource planning
(ERP)  system  in its  automotive  businesses  in  North  America.  Among  other
features, this system facilitates the tracking and control of supplies and spare
parts  inventories.  To take  advantage  of the  enhanced  tracking  and control
features of the ERP system, the Company capitalized the supplies and spare parts
inventories  at  three   locations,   whereas   previously  the  cost  of  these
manufacturing  supplies was expensed when  purchased.  Management  believed this
change was  preferable  in that it provides for a more  appropriate  matching of
revenues and expenses. The total amount of inventory capitalized and reported as
a  cumulative  effect  of a  change  in  accounting  principle,  retroactive  to
September  1,  1999,  is $983,  net of income  taxes of $602.  The effect of the
change in 2000 was to increase  income  before  cumulative  effect of accounting
change by $248 ($.03 per share).

Management  of the Company  believes the  September 11 terrorist  attack and the
U.S.   retaliation  could  depress  the  Company's  markets  further;   however,
management believes that economic recovery in the Company's market sector should
be no more than six to nine months away.  Despite the anticipated lower level of
economic  activity,  the Company was awarded six new wheel programs with General
Motors in North  America and its first wheel order in North America with Daimler
Chrysler.  The Company has also started up new  business  that will equal 10% of
revenue in Europe and added several  important  pieces of business in suspension
components. In addition, the Company began production of front and rear knuckles
for Saab and Opel in Europe  from two plants in  Indiana.  In fiscal  2002,  the
Company will focus heavily on reducing SG&A spending  overall and lowering total
labor cost.

Flow  Control  Products  Net sales of the Flow  Control  Products  segment  were
$151,216 in 2001,  compared with $168,181 in 2000 and $178,483 in 1999. The Flow
Control Products segment  experienced  strong competitive market pricing in 2001
that,  combined with an unfavorable  product mix,  reduced sales by 8.8%.  Lower
volume  reduced  sales an additional  1.3%.  The Flow Control  Products  segment
recorded $6,229 of unusual items in 2001, primarily to scrap certain slow moving
inventories.  Excluding the unusual items,  Flow Control  Products had operating
income of $11,700  compared with $23,663 in 2000. The impact of the  competitive
pricing  issues and  unfavorable  product mix  significantly  reduced  operating
profit.

The decrease in 2000 is primarily  due to lower sales volume of copper and brass
products  associated  with the loss of two  customers at the Company's Lee Brass
unit and decreased sales from divested  operations.  Annual sales volume for the
two customers was  approximately  $7,900,  and the Company was able to replace a
portion  of those  sales in 2000.  The  lower  volumes  decreased  sales by 7.4%
compared with 1999. While this segment did face sporadic price competition,  the
reduced volume was partially offset by overall  favorable pricing that increased
sales by 1.6%.  Operating  income was $23,663 in 2000  compared  with $31,061 in
1999. Lower volumes and higher material costs decreased  operating income by 10%
each. While price  competition  prevented the Company from passing higher copper
costs on to customers,  current  pricing and  favorable  product mix combined to
increase  operating income by 13.5%. The cost reduction  program  implemented in
March 2000,  combined  with  continuous  improvement  activities  in the plants,
helped to offset the material cost and pricing issues.

Engineered  Components  Net  sales of the  Engineered  Components  segment  were
$378,157 in 2001,  compared  with  $442,474 in 2000 and $410,450 in 1999.  Sales
decreased by 14.5% due to a drop in volume, particularly at the

<PAGE>

Company's  North  American  operations  where the Company is coping with a major
downturn  in U.S.  automotive  production.  The  positive  impact of a favorable
product mix at the Company's European  operations was offset by a weaker Italian
lira in 2001 compared with 2000.  The  Engineered  Components  segment  recorded
$7,768  of  unusual  items,  primarily  to  dispose  of  certain  under-utilized
machinery, tooling, and equipment and to increase the allowance for doubtful and
disputed receivables.  Excluding the unusual items, Engineered Components had an
operating  loss of  $8,915  compared  with  operating  income of $5,243 in 2000.
Significantly  lower sales volume and inventory  absorption  contributed  to the
operating loss in 2001.

The Company's Engineered  Components product sales continued to grow in 2000, as
the global wheel business continues to expand,  win new customers,  and launch a
variety of new wheel styles. The aluminum  components  business also experienced
significant sales growth as their customers fully incorporated new products into
additional  vehicle  platforms.  Sales volume increased 4.8% as sales of control
arms and European wheels were offset by a decline in North American wheels sales
as one customer  experienced lower sales on three vehicles.  Higher pricing,  in
the form of aluminum  cost  pass-throughs  reflected in the selling price of the
Company's  products,  and a favorable  product mix  increased  sales by 3.4% and
5.6%, respectively.  However, a weaker Italian lira in fiscal 2000 compared with
fiscal 1999 reduced sales by 5.6%.  Operating income was $5,243 in 2000 compared
with $15,566 in 1999. The two accounting changes previously  discussed increased
operating income; however,  several factors negatively impacted operating income
during 2000.  Increased costs  associated with the  over-capacity  volume issues
previously  discussed  and  higher   manufacturing-related   spending  decreased
operating  income by over 20%.  Material costs that could not be passed along to
customers under existing price formulas,  primarily at our European  operations,
further reduced  operating income by 28.8%.  Pricing and an unfavorable  product
mix reduced  operating  income by 21.2%.  Also  contributing  to the decrease in
operating  income in 2000 were costs  associated  with high  levels of  employee
turnover   and   the   difficulty   of   obtaining    qualified   labor   in   a
near-full-employment economy.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by  operations  in 2001 was $9,996,  compared with $40,341 in 2000
and $64,770 in 1999. The non-cash  benefits of depreciation,  amortization,  and
other  non-cash  charges  were offset by the net loss for 2001.  Early in fiscal
2001,  inventory levels were increased while sales were declining.  The focus of
new  management  of the Company has been the  management  of working  capital by
collecting accounts receivable and reducing inventories.  However, a significant
amount  of cash  was  used to  reduce  accounts  payable  from  the  high  level
outstanding at August 31, 2000.

Investing  activities used net cash of $28,686 in 2001, compared with $25,802 in
2000 and  $12,656  in 1999.  Capital  expenditures  totaled  $29,719 in 2001 and
$21,535 in 2000,  compared  to $47,360  expended  in 1999.  To support  business
expansion  activities  in previous  years,  investments  were made in  property,
plant, and equipment and in CTC. Capital expenditures decreased significantly in
2001 and 2000 from prior levels, as the Company  turned its focus from expansion
to cost reduction and improving production efficiencies. Capital expenditures in
2001 included  equipment to support and produce  products for new contracts that
have been awarded and to implement new information  systems. At August 31, 2001,
the Company had $6,744 of  commitments  for capital  expenditures  to be made in
2002, primarily for the Engineered Components segment. In 2001, the Company also
used $674 ($2,000 less cash received) to purchase the remaining 40-percent share
in CTC from its joint venture partner Izumi Industries,  LTD. The purchase price
was approximately  $4,000 of which $2,000 is payable in annual installments over
the next five years.  During 2000, the Company resolved several matters with the
former owners of Speedline which,  among other items,  resulted in a purchase by
the Company of 478,240 shares of the Company's  common stock held by Speedline's
former  owners and a net cash payment to the former  owners of $2,500.  Proceeds
from the sale of businesses provided $35,604 in 1999.

Financing activities provided $31,294 of cash in 2001 versus $18,148 and $51,466
of cash  used in 2000  and  1999,  respectively.  Additional  financing  in 2001
included a net increase of $28,343 of long-term  borrowings  under the Company's
Revolver  Agreement  and  $3,806  borrowed  under  lines  of  credit.  Financing
activities  also included  $1,500  received from the sale of treasury shares and
$2,355 used for the payment of dividends.  The Company did not declare dividends
in the last two  quarters of 2001 and due to  financial  losses,  it is unlikely
that the Company  will be in a position to declare any future  dividends  for at
least the immediate future.

 During  1999,  the Company  reduced  total debt by $51,904 and further  reduced
total debt by $18,728 in 2000.  The debt  reductions  were financed in part with
the  proceeds  from  the  Superior  Valve  sale in 1999  and the  proceeds  from
sale-leaseback  transactions  in both 1999 and 2000.  Financing  activities also
included dividend payments of $5,109 and $4,851 and repurchases of the Company's
stock of $1,255 and $4,594 in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The Company maintains a Revolver  Agreement that had provided for up to $150,000
in borrowings  through August 2002. Debt covenants under the Revolver  Agreement
required the Company to maintain certain  debt-to-earnings and interest coverage
ratios. Due to operating losses incurred during the second quarter,  at March 4,
2001, the Company was not in compliance with the  debt-to-earnings  and interest
coverage ratios under the Revolver Agreement. This resulted in a cross violation
in the  Company's  Senior Note  Agreement  (the Senior Notes) and the CTC Credit
Agreement  (the CTC  Agreement) of which the Company had  guaranteed  $14,094 at
March 4, 2001. The lenders under the Revolver  Agreement,  and the CTC Agreement
have waived the  financial  covenant  violations  through  April 15,  2002.  The
lenders  under the Senior Notes have waived the  financial  covenant  violations
through  September,  2002.  The  Company  plans to  establish  new  Senior  Note
covenants  during the first half of Fiscal 2002. The Company also has borrowings
outstanding under lines of credit totaling $14,200 with an average interest rate
of 8.5%.  The Company can no longer borrow  additional  funds under the Revolver
Agreement  or the  lines of  credit  and the  lenders  now  have a  subordinated
security  interest in the assets of the Company's U.S.  subsidiaries and certain
stock of the  foreign  subsidiaries.  Interest  rates for  borrowings  under the
Revolver Agreement  increased to prime plus 2% and the Senior Notes increased to
9.09%, plus an additional 1% for payment in kind.

On June 5, 2001,  the Company  entered into a new credit  agreement  (the Credit
Agreement),  which provides for the ability to make new borrowings  initially up
to $15,000,  increasing  in stages to a maximum of $35,000  based on the Company
meeting certain conditions.  Borrowings are limited to specified  percentages of
eligible  receivables,  inventories,  and property and equipment.  At August 31,
2001,  the Company  had a maximum  borrowing  capacity  of  $30,000.  The Credit
Agreement  matures on April 15, 2002.  Among other things,  the Credit Agreement
requires  the  Company  to  grant  a first  priority  security  interest  in the
Company's  U.S.  assets  including,  all  real  property,  accounts  receivable,
inventory,  machinery and equipment, as well as a subordinated security interest
to lenders under the Revolver  Agreement and Senior  Notes.  Interest  rates for
borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prime plus 4%.

Subsequent to August 31, 2001, the Company amended the Revolver Agreement.  This
amendment extended the Revolver Agreement through September 2002 and established
new financial covenants with it's lenders in which the Company must, among other
things,  maintain  quarterly levels of total  liabilities to tangible net worth,
free cash flow, EBITDA, and meet scheduled debt repayments. The maximum level of
total  liabilities  to  tangible  net worth is not to exceed 6.4 at  December 2,
2001, 7.0 at March 3, 2002, 6.8 at June 2, 2002, and 6.5 at August 31, 2002. The
minimum  level of free cash flow is to be $8,100 at December 2, 2001,  $6,100 at
March 3, 2002,  $20,900  at June 2, 2002,  and  $31,200 at August 31,  2002.  In
addition,  the Company must make scheduled debt  reductions  (which are included
with the current portion of long-term debt) of $5,000, $6,500, and $5,000 at the
end of the first,  third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002,  respectively.  If
these minimum levels are not maintained, any outstanding balances become payable
upon demand by the Company's lenders.  Based on the Company's  forcasted ability
to comply with the revised debt covenants, it continues to classify debt as long
term.  The  Credit  Agreement  and  CTC  Agreement  also  include  a  subjective
acceleration clause whereby the lenders can declare an event of default upon any
material  adverse  change as defined by the lenders.  At August 31, 2001,  there
were no  borrowings  outstanding  under the Credit  Agreement  and  $13,356  was
outstanding under the CTC Agreement.

In order to meet the new  financial  covenants,  the  Company  needs to  achieve
operating  results  substantially  consistent with its 2002 operating plan. This
plan calls for 2002 sales to be slightly  higher than in 2001. The Company plans
to reduce cost of goods sold through  improved  plant  efficiencies,  decreasing
inventories,  higher  productivity,  and lower scrap.  In addition,  the Company
plans to reduce selling,  general and administrative  expenses primarily through
reductions  in personnel  and  employee  benefit  costs,  and other cost savings
programs.

In  consideration  for the Credit  Agreement  and waiver of covenant  violations
under the Revolver  Agreement and Senior Notes,  the Company granted warrants to
purchase  455,220  shares of the Company's  common stock at a purchase  price of
$8.80 per share.  The warrants are  immediately  exercisable  and expire June 3,
2005.  If the maturity  date of the Revolver  Agreement is extended to September
2003, warrants for the purchase of an additional 255,000 shares will be issued.

The CTC Agreement  provided for borrowings under a revolving credit facility and
a term loan.  At August 31,  2001,  $4,500 was  outstanding  on the revolver and
$8,856 was  outstanding on the term loan, both with interest rates at prime plus
2%. CTC subsequently entered into a new credit facility, effective September 18,
2001, that provides for up to $15,356 in borrowings with interest rates at prime
or LIBOR plus 2.25%.  The revolver  portion matures  September 2002 and the term
loan matures August 2003.

<PAGE>

The Senior Notes originally  required periodic  principal  payments beginning in
November 2002 through  November  2005.  The maturity date of the Senior Notes is
now November 2003. If the maturity date of the Revolver Agreement is extended to
September  2003,  the  principal  payment  under the  Senior  Notes  that is due
November 2002, will be extended to November 2003.

The  Company's  foreign  operations  have  short-term  lines of credit  totaling
approximately  $17,274 that are subject to annual  review by the lending  banks.
Amounts  outstanding under these lines of credit are payable on demand and total
$2,741 as of August 31, 2001.

The ratio of long-term debt as a percent of capital increased to 59.6% at August
31, 2001 from 48.6% at August 31,  2000.  Book value per common  share at August
31, 2001 was $13.47,  down from $18.55 at August 31, 2000. One million preferred
shares and  approximately 5.8 million common shares are authorized and available
for future  issuance.  On December  17,  1998,  the Company  announced a plan to
repurchase  up to 750,000 of its  outstanding  common  shares.  As of August 31,
2001, 350,000 shares have been repurchased under this plan at an average cost of
$15.53 per share. The Company currently has 8,576,740 common shares outstanding.
Management  believes  the Company has adequate  financial  resources to meet its
future needs.

Contingencies  The Company,  as is normal for the industry in which it operates,
is involved in certain legal  proceedings and subject to certain claims and site
investigations  that arise under the environmental  laws and which have not been
finally adjudicated. To the extent possible, with the information available, the
Company  regularly  evaluates its  responsibility  with respect to environmental
proceedings.  The factors considered in this evaluation are more fully described
in  the  Commitments  and  Contingencies  note  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements.  At August 31, 2001,  the Company had reserves of $2,855 accrued for
environmental liabilities.  Based upon the contracts and agreements with regards
to two environmental  matters,  the Company believes it is entitled to indemnity
for remediation  costs at two sites and believes it is probable that the Company
can recover a  substantial  portion of the costs.  Accordingly,  the Company has
recorded  receivables  of $1,115 related to  anticipated  recoveries  from third
parties.

Allied-Signal Inc. (now Honeywell) brought an action against the Company seeking
a contribution  from the Company equal to 50% of Honeywell's  estimated  $30,000
remediation  cost  in  connection  with a site in  southern  Ohio.  The  Company
believes its responsibility with respect to this site is very limited due to the
nature of the  foundry  sand  waste it  disposed  of at the site.  The court has
rendered its decision on this case; however, the exact amount of the verdict has
not yet been determined by the court. The amount will be significantly less than
the amount  sought by the  plaintiff  and the Company  estimates  its  liability
associated with the action to be between $500 and $1,500.  The Company  believes
its liability is at the low end of this range.

The Company is of the  opinion  that,  in light of its  existing  reserves,  its
liability  in  connection  with  environmental  proceedings  should  not  have a
material adverse effect on its financial  condition,  results of operations,  or
cash flows.  The Company is presently  unaware of the existence of any potential
material  environmental  costs  that are  likely  to occur  in  connection  with
disposition of any of its property.


Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

New accounting  standards adopted during 2001 include SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS Nos. 137
and 138, which  establishes a  comprehensive  standard for the  recognition  and
measurement of derivatives  and hedging  activities.  The new standard  requires
that all  derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities in the statement of
financial position and be measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from
changes in fair value are required to be recognized in current  earnings  unless
specific hedge criteria are met. Special  accounting  allows for gains or losses
on  qualifying  derivatives  to offset gains or losses on the hedged item in the
statement of income and requires formal  documentation  of the  effectiveness of
transactions  that receive hedge  accounting.  The adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the Company's  consolidated results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows.

The Company also adopted the  provisions of Securities  and Exchange  Commission
Staff  Accounting   Bulletin  (SAB)  101,  "Revenue   Recognition  in  Financial
Statements,"  which  provides  guidance on the  recognition,  presentation,  and
disclosure of revenue in financial  statements.  The adoption of SAB 101 did not
have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

<PAGE>

New accounting  standards issued include SFAS No. 141,  "Business  Combinations"
and  SFAS No.  142,  "Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets."  SFAS  No.  141
discontinues  the use of the pooling of interest  method and  requires  that the
purchase  method of accounting be used for all business  combinations  initiated
after June 30, 2001.  The new standard also specifies  criteria that  intangible
assets acquired in a business  combination must meet to be recognized apart from
goodwill.  SFAS No. 142 requires  that  goodwill and certain  intangible  assets
(deemed to have indefinite lives) no longer be amortized,  but instead be tested
for impairment,  at least on an annual basis, and written down in the periods in
which the  recorded  amount is greater  than the fair  value.  Other  intangible
assets will  continue to be  amortized  over their useful lives and reviewed for
impairment  in  accordance  with  SFAS No.  121.  These  standards  only  permit
prospective application;  therefore, adoption of these standards will not affect
previously  reported  financial  information.  SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 will become
effective  for the Company in the first  quarter of fiscal  2003;  however,  the
Company is evaluating early adoption as of September 1, 2001.

The Company will evaluate its existing  intangible assets and goodwill that were
acquired in prior business combinations and, upon adoption of the new standards,
make any necessary  reclassifications  in order to conform with the new criteria
for  recognition  apart  from  goodwill.  If early  adopted, the Company will be
required to perform initial  impairment  tests of goodwill and indefinite  lived
intangible  assets during 2002. Any  impairment  loss will be measured as of the
date of adoption and recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle as of the beginning of fiscal 2002.  Because of the  extensive  effort
needed to comply with adopting SFAS No. 142, as of the date of this report,  the
Company cannot estimate the entire impact adopting the standard will have on the
Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows;
however  amortization expense of $ 1,354 related to goodwill would be eliminated
in 2002.  The adoption of SFAS No. 141 should not have a material  effect on the
Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

SFAS No. 143,  "Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations,"  and SFAS No. 144
"Accounting  for  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" were also issued
SFAS No. 143  addresses  the  financial  accounting  and  reporting  for certain
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
related  retirement costs.  SFAS No. 144 addresses the financial  accounting and
reporting for the impairment of long-lived  assets and supercedes  SFAS No. 121.
Both standards will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2003. The Company
has not determined the effect of these new standards.

Market Risks
The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency  exchange
rates  and  interest  rates as part of its  normal  operations.  To  manage  the
volatility  relating to these  exposures on a  consolidated  basis,  the Company
takes  advantage of natural  offsets.  The Company has estimated its market risk
exposures using sensitivity analyses assuming a 10% change in market rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Due to its foreign  operations,  the Company
has  assets,  liabilities,  and cash  flows in  currencies  other  than the U.S.
dollar.  The Company  minimizes  the impact of foreign  currency  exchange  rate
fluctuations on its Italian net investment  with debt borrowings  denominated in
Italian lira.  Fluctuations in foreign  currency  exchange rates also impact the
dollar value of non-U.S.  cash flows.  To  illustrate  the  potential  impact of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the dollar value of non-U.S.  cash
flows, a hypothetical 10% change in the average exchange rates for 2001 and 2000
would change income before taxes by approximately $800 and $700, respectively.

The  Company's  Italian  operations  also attempt to balance asset and liability
positions that are denominated in non-functional currencies,  primarily the U.S.
dollar, Japanese yen, and British pound sterling.  During 2001 and 2000, the net
exposure averaged approximately $3,800 and $1,700,  respectively. A hypothetical
10% change in the average  exchange  rates would change the exposure by $380 for
2001 and by $200 for 2000,  respectively,  and that change would be reflected in
the operating  results of the Company.  The analysis assumes a parallel shift in
currency  exchange  rates,  relative to the Italian lira.  Exchange rates rarely
move in the same direction, and the assumption that the exchange rates change in
parallel  may  overstate  the  impact  of the  foreign  currency  exchange  rate
fluctuations.  The increase in net exposure  between  years is primarily  due to
unfavorable Italian lira exchange rates.

Interest  Rate Risk To manage its  exposure  to changes in interest  rates,  the
Company uses both fixed and variable rate debt. At August 31, 2001 and 2000, the
Company had approximately  $146,200 and $98,600 of debt obligations  outstanding
with variable interest rates with a weighted-average  effective interest rate of
8.3% and 6.6%, respectively. A hypothetical 10% change in the effective interest
rate for these borrowings,  using the outstanding debt levels at August 31, 2001
and 2000,  would  change  interest  expense  by  approximately  $1,200  and $700
respectively.  The increase in interest rate exposure is primarily due to higher
effective interest rates.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

Shareholders and Board of Directors
Amcast Industrial Corporation, Dayton, Ohio

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated statements of financial condition
of Amcast  Industrial  Corporation  and  subsidiaries  as of August 31, 2001 and
2000, and the related  consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended August 31, 2001.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
item 14 (a). These financial  statements and schedule are the  responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the consolidated financial position of Amcast Industrial
Corporation and  subsidiaries at August 31, 2001 and 2000, and the  consolidated
results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended August 31,  2001,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United  States.  Also,  in our  opinion,  the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements  taken as a whole,  presents  fairly  in all  material  respects  the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in the summary of accounting  policies,  in fiscal 2000 the Company
changed its method of accounting for supplies and spare parts inventory.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
($ in thousands except per share amounts)

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated  financial statements include the accounts of Amcast Industrial
Corporation   and  its  domestic  and  foreign   subsidiaries   (the   Company).
Intercompany  accounts and transactions  have been eliminated.  Prior to June 5,
2001,  the Company's  investment in Casting  Technology  Company  (CTC), a joint
venture,  was included in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements
using the equity method of accounting (see  Acquisitions and Divestitures).  The
Company's  investment  in CTC was $7,266 at August 31, 2000 and was  included in
Other Assets.  Operations of the Company's European subsidiaries are included in
the consolidated  financial statements for periods ending one month prior to the
Company's  fiscal  year  end  in  order  to  ensure  timely  preparation  of the
consolidated financial statements.

For foreign subsidiaries, the local foreign currency is the functional currency.
Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S.  dollars at the rate of exchange
existing at year-end.  Translation  gains and losses are included as a component
of shareholders' equity and comprehensive  income.  Income statement amounts are
translated at the average monthly exchange rates.  Transaction  gains and losses
are included in the statement of income and were not material.

Revenue  is  recognized  at  the  time  products  are  shipped  to  unaffiliated
customers, legal title has passed and all significant contractual obligations of
the Company have been satisfied.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts on deposit with financial institutions
and investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $2,506
and $1,711 at August 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The Company held accounts
receivable of $2,938 from CTC at August 31, 2000.

Inventories  are  valued  at the  lower of cost or  market  using  the  last-in,
first-out (LIFO) and the first-in,  first-out (FIFO) methods.  During 2000, as a
result of a new enterprise  resource planning (ERP) system  implementation,  the
Company  began  capitalizing  the cost of supplies and spare parts  inventories,
whereas  previously the cost of these  manufacturing  supplies was expensed when
purchased.  Management  believed this change was  preferable in that it provided
for a more  appropriate  matching of revenues and expenses.  The total amount of
inventory  capitalized  and  reported  as a  cumulative  effect  of a change  in
accounting principle, retroactive to September 1, 1999, was $983 net of taxes of
$602. The effect of the change in 2000 was to increase income before  cumulative
effect of  accounting  change by $248  ($0.03  per  diluted  share).  Additional
disclosures pursuant to Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 20, "Accounting
Changes"  are not  provided  since  supplies  inventory  was not  monitored  for
financial  reporting purposes prior to the implementation of the ERP system and,
consequently, the information is not available.

Property,  plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for significant
renewals and improvements  are capitalized.  Repairs and maintenance are charged
to expense as incurred.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
based upon the estimated  useful lives of the assets as follows:  buildings - 20
to 40 years;  machinery  and equipment - 3 to 20 years.  Effective  September 1,
1999,  the  depreciable  lives of certain  assets of foreign  subsidiaries  were
changed based upon a study performed by an independent  appraisal  company.  The
effect of this  change in 2000 was a  reduction  of  depreciation  expense and a
corresponding increase in income before income taxes of approximately $2,400. As
a result, net income in 2000 increased by $1,488 ($0.17 per share).

Tooling expenditures reimbursable by the customer are capitalized and classified
as a current asset.  Tooling  expenditures  not reimbursable by the customer are
capitalized and classified with property,  plant,  and equipment then charged to
expense over the estimated useful life.

Goodwill  represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair
market value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is
amortized on a straight-line  basis over 40 years.  Accumulated  amortization of
goodwill  was $6,401 and $5,048 at August 31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The
carrying  value  of  goodwill  is  evaluated  periodically  in  relation  to the
operating  performance  and future  undiscounted  cash  flows of the  underlying
businesses.

Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary  differences  between financial
and tax reporting in accordance  with the liability  method under the provisions
of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes."

Use of estimates and  assumptions  are made by management in the  preparation of
the financial  statements in conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States that affect the amounts  reported in the financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ from those
estimates.

Earnings per common share are  calculated  under the provisions of SFAS No. 128,
"Earnings per Share." The  calculation  of basic  earnings per share is based on
the  weighted-average  number of common shares  outstanding.  The calculation of
diluted  earnings  per share is based on the  weighted-average  number of common
shares outstanding plus all potential dilutive common shares outstanding.

Start-up and  organization  costs are accounted for under the  provisions of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants'  Statement of Position (SOP)
98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities." which requires such costs
to be expensed as incurred.

Accounting  standards adopted during 2001 include SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS Nos. 137 and
138,  which  establishes  a  comprehensive  standard  for  the  recognition  and
measurement of derivatives  and hedging  activities.  The new standard  requires
that all  derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities in the statement of
financial position and be measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from
changes in fair value are required to be recognized in current  earnings  unless
specific hedge criteria are met. Special  accounting  allows for gains or losses
on  qualifying  derivatives  to offset gains or losses on the hedged item in the
statement of income and requires formal  documentation  of the  effectiveness of
transactions  that receive hedge  accounting.  The adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the Company's  consolidated results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows.

The Company also adopted the  provisions of Securities  and Exchange  Commission
Staff  Accounting   Bulletin  (SAB)  101,  "Revenue   Recognition  in  Financial
Statements,"  which  provides  guidance on the  recognition,  presentation,  and
disclosure of revenue in financial  statements.  The adoption of SAB 101 did not
have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

New accounting  standards issued include SFAS No. 141,  "Business  Combinations"
and  SFAS No.  142,  "Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets."  SFAS  No.  141
discontinues  the use of the pooling of interest  method and  requires  that the
purchase  method of accounting be used for all business  combinations  initiated
after June 30, 2001.  The new standard also specifies  criteria that  intangible
assets acquired in a business  combination must meet to be recognized apart from
goodwill.  SFAS No. 142 requires  that  goodwill and certain  intangible  assets
(deemed to have indefinite lives) no longer be amortized,  but instead be tested
for impairment,  at least on an annual basis, and written down in the periods in
which the  recorded  amount is greater  than the fair  value.  Other  intangible
assets will  continue to be  amortized  over their useful lives and reviewed for
impairment  in  accordance  with  SFAS No.  121.  These  standards  only  permit
prospective application;  therefore, adoption of these standards will not affect
previously  reported  financial  information.  SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 will become
effective  for the Company in the first  quarter of fiscal  2003;  however,  the
Company is evaluating early adoption as of September 1, 2001.

The Company will evaluate its existing  intangible assets and goodwill that were
acquired in prior business combinations and, upon adoption of the new standards,
make any necessary  reclassifications  in order to conform with the new criteria
for recognition apart from goodwill.  If early adopted, the Company will also be
required to perform initial  impairment  tests of goodwill and indefinite  lived
intangible assets during fiscal 2002. Any impairment loss will be measured as of
the date of  adoption  and  recognized  as a  cumulative  effect  of a change in
accounting  principle  as of  the  beginning  of  fiscal  2002.  Because  of the
extensive  effort needed to comply with adopting SFAS No. 142, as of the date of
this report, the Company cannot estimate the entire impact adopting the standard
will  have  on the  Company's  consolidated  results  of  operations,  financial
position,  or cash flows;  however,  amortization  expense of $1,354  related to
goodwill would be eliminated in 2002, which would increase per share earnings by
$0.16.  The  adoption  of SFAS No. 141 should not have a material  effect on the
Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

<PAGE>

SFAS No. 143,  "Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations," and SFAS No. 144,
"Accounting  for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" were also issued.
SFAS No. 143  addresses  the  financial  accounting  and  reporting  for certain
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
related  retirement costs.  SFAS No. 144 addresses the financial  accounting and
reporting for the impairment of long-lived  assets and supersedes  SFAS No. 121.
Both standards will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2003. The Company
has not determined the effect of these new standards.

Certain  reclassifications  have been made to  certain  prior  year  amounts  to
conform to the current-year presentation.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
On October 16, 1998,  the Company  sold  Superior  Valve  Company for $35,604 in
cash.  The  transaction  resulted  in a pre-tax  gain of $9,023.  The  business,
acquired by Amcast in 1986,  produces  specialty valves and related products for
the compressed gas and commercial refrigeration markets. Results for fiscal 1999
included sales of approximately $4,600 in the Company's Flow Control segment.

At the end of  1997,  the  Company  acquired  all of the  outstanding  stock  of
Speedline  S.p.A.  and its  subsidiaries  (Speedline).  The  purchase  agreement
contained  a provision  to protect  the seller  from stock  price  fluctuations.
During 2000, the Company resolved  several matters with the seller which,  among
other items,  resulted in the  purchase by the Company of 478,240  shares of the
Company's  common stock held by the seller,  a reduction  in the purchase  price
(goodwill) of $10,000 and a net cash payment to the seller of $2,500.

Effective June 5, 2001, the Company purchased the remaining 40% share in Casting
Technology  Company (CTC), from Izumi Industries,  LTD, bringing total ownership
to 100%. The purchase price was approximately  $4,000 of which $2,000 is payable
in annual  installments  over the next five years. The acquisition was accounted
for by the  purchase  method;  accordingly,  the  cost  of the  acquisition  was
allocated on the basis of the estimated fair market value of the assets acquired
and liabilities  assumed.  No goodwill was recognized from the transaction.  The
financial results of CTC have been included as part of the Engineered Components
segment in the  consolidated  financial  statements  since the  purchase  of the
remaining 40% share. Prior to June 5, 2001, the Company's  investment in CTC was
accounted for by the equity method.  Summarized  financial  information  for the
nine months  ended June 5, 2001 and the years ended  August 31, 2000 and 1999 is
as follows:

The Company  maintains a credit  agreement  (the  Revolver  Agreement)  that had
provided for up to $150,000 in borrowings  through  August 2002.  Debt covenants
under  the  Revolver   Agreement   required  the  Company  to  maintain  certain
debt-to-earnings  and interest coverage ratios. Due to operating losses incurred
during the second  quarter,  at March 4, 2001, the Company was not in compliance
with the  debt-to-earnings  and interest  coverage  covenants under the Revolver
Agreement.  This  resulted in a cross  violation  in the  Company's  Senior Note
Agreement (the Senior Notes) and the CTC Credit Agreement (the CTC Agreement) of
which the Company had guaranteed $14,094 at March 4, 2001. The lenders under the
Revolver  Agreement,  and the CTC Agreement  have waived the financial  covenant
violations  through  April 15,  2002.  The lenders  under the Senior  Notes have
waived the financial covenant  violations  through September,  2002. The Company
plans to  establish  new Senior Note  covenants  during the first half of Fiscal
2002. The Company also has borrowings outstanding under lines of credit totaling
$14,200 with an average  interest rate of 8.5%. The Company can no longer borrow
additional  funds under the  Revolver  Agreement  or the lines of credit and the
lenders now have a subordinated security interest in the assets of the Company's
U.S. subsidiaries and certain stock of the foreign subsidiaries.  Interest rates
for borrowings under the Revolver  Agreement  increased to prime plus 2% and the
Senior Notes increased to 9.09%, plus an additional 1% for payment in kind.

On June 5, 2001,  the Company  entered into a new credit  agreement  (the Credit
Agreement),  which provides for the ability to make new borrowings  initially up
to $15,000,  increasing  in stages to a maximum of $35,000  based on the Company
meeting certain conditions.  Borrowings are limited to specified  percentages of
eligible  receivables,  inventories,  and property and equipment.  At August 31,
2001,  the Company  had a maximum  borrowing  capacity  of  $30,000.  The Credit
Agreement  matures on April 15, 2002.  Among other things,  the Credit Agreement
requires  the  Company  to  grant  a first  priority  security  interest  in the
Company's  U.S.  assets  including,  all  real  property,  accounts  receivable,
inventory,  machinery and equipment, as well as a subordinated security interest
to lenders under the Revolver  Agreement and Senior  Notes.  Interest  rates for
borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prime plus 4%.

Subsequent to August 31, 2001, the Company amended the Revolver Agreement.  This
amendment   extended  the  Revolver   Agreement   through  September  2002,  and
established new financial  covenants with its lenders in which the Company must,
among other things,  maintain  quarterly levels of total liabilities to tangible
net worth,  free cash flow,  EBITDA,  and meet  scheduled debt  repayments.  The
maximum level of total liabilities to tangible net worth is not to exceed 6.4 at
December 2, 2001,  7.0 at March 3, 2002,  6.8 at June 2, 2002, and 6.5 at August
31,  2002.  The  minimum  cumulative  level of free cash flow is to be $8,100 at
December 2, 2001, $6,100 at March 3, 2002,  $20,900 at June 2, 2002, and $31,200
at August 31, 2002. In addition, the Company must make scheduled debt reductions
(which are  included  with the  current  portion of  long-term  debt) of $5,000,
$6,500, and $5,000 at the end of the first, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal
2002, respectively.  If these minimum levels are not maintained, any outstanding
balances  become  payable  upon demand by the  Company's  lenders.  Based on the
Company's  forecasted  ability to comply with the  revised  debt  covenants,  it
continues to classify debt as long term. The Credit  Agreement and CTC Agreement
also include a subjective acceleration clause whereby the lenders can declare an
event of default upon any material adverse change as defined by the lenders.  At
August 31, 2001, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement
and $13,356 was outstanding under the CTC Agreement.

In order to meet the new  financial  covenants,  the  Company  needs to  achieve
operating  results  substantially  consistent with its 2002 operating plan. This
plan calls for a significant  increase in operating income. The Company plans to
increase gross profit through improved plant efficiencies,  higher productivity,
and lower scrap. In addition,  the Company plans to reduce selling,  general and
administrative  expenses  primarily through reductions in personnel and employee
benefit costs, and other cost savings programs.

In  consideration  for the Credit  Agreement  and waiver of covenant  violations
under the Revolver  Agreement and Senior Notes,  the Company granted warrants to
purchase  455,220  shares of the Company's  common stock at a purchase  price of
$8.80 per share.  The warrants are  immediately  exercisable  and expire June 3,
2005.  If the maturity  date of the Revolver  Agreement is extended to September
2003, warrants for the purchase of an additional 255,000 shares will be issued.

The CTC Agreement  provided for borrowings under a revolving credit facility and
a term loan.  At August 31,  2001,  $4,500 was  outstanding  on the revolver and
$8,856 was  outstanding on the term loan, both with interest rates at prime plus
2%. CTC subsequently entered into a new credit facility, effective September 18,
2001,  that provides for up to $15,356 in borrowings at interest  rates at prime
or LIBOR plus 2.25%.  The revolver  portion matures  September 2002 and the term
loan matures August 2003.

The Senior Notes originally  required periodic  principal  payments beginning in
November 2002 through  November  2005.  The maturity date of the Senior Notes is
now November 2003. If the maturity date of the Revolver Agreement is extended to
September  2003,  the  principal  payment  under the  Senior  Notes  that is due
November 2002, will be extended to November 2003.

Other debt includes the term loan under the CTC  Agreement and various  mortgage
loans with  variable  interest  rates,  ranging  from 3.0% to 5.8% that  require
periodic  principal  payments  through 2006.  The mortgage  loans are secured by
property,  plant,  and equipment  with a net book value of $13,300 at August 31,
2001.

Capitalized  lease  obligations  are payable  through  2003. At August 31, 2001,
future minimum payments for the leases were $1,143,  including $134 representing
interest.

The carrying amounts of the Company's debt instruments approximate fair value as
defined  under SFAS No. 107. Fair value is estimated  based on  discounted  cash
flows, as well as other valuation techniques. Long-term debt maturities for each
of the next five years are $21,383 in 2002,  $131,737 in 2003,  $37,976 in 2004,
$230 in 2005, and $192 in 2006.

The  Company's  foreign  operations  have  short-term  lines of credit  totaling
approximately $17,274 that are subject to annual review by the lending banks. At
August 31, 2001, the average  interest rate for the  short-term  lines of credit
was 5.7%. Amounts  outstanding under these lines of credit are payable on demand
and total $2,741 as of August 31, 2001.

Interest  paid was  $15,890,  $12,945,  and  $13,044  in 2001,  2000,  and 1999,
respectively.

LEASES
The Company  has a number of  operating  lease  agreements  primarily  involving
machinery,  physical  distribution,  and  computer  equipment.  Certain of these
leases contain renewal or purchase options that vary by lease.  These leases are
noncancelable  and  expire on dates  through  2009.  During  1999 and 2000,  the
Company entered into  sale-leaseback  transactions  whereby the Company sold new
and  existing  manufacturing  equipment  and  leased  it back for 7  years.  The
leasebacks are being accounted for as operating leases. The gains of $2,044 have
been deferred and are being amortized to income over the lease term.

Rent expense was $6,150, $5,277, and $3,215 for the years ended August 31, 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively.

The following is a schedule by year of future minimum rental  payments  required
under the operating  leases that have initial or remaining  noncancelable  lease
terms in excess of one year as of August 31, 2001:

PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS
Pension Plans:  The Company has a  noncontributory  defined benefit pension plan
covering  certain  employees.  The plan covers  salaried  employees and provides
pension  benefits  that  are  based  on  years  of  credited  service,  employee
compensation during years preceding retirement,  and the primary social security
benefit.  The plan also covers hourly employees and provides pension benefits of
stated  amounts for each year of credited  service.  The Company's  policy is to
fund the annual amount required by the Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act
of 1974. Plan assets consist of U.S. Treasury bonds and notes, U.S. governmental
agency issues,  corporate bonds, and common stocks. The plan held 510,526 common
shares of the  Company at August  31,  2001 (4.0% of plan  assets)  and  350,000
shares at August 31, 2000 (3.0% of plan assets).

In 1999, the Company  amended its defined  benefit  pension plan with respect to
certain  salaried and hourly  employees by  establishing a defined  benefit cash
balance  pension plan (the Plan).  The Plan provides  pension  benefits that are
based on years of  credited  service  and  employee  compensation  during  years
preceding  retirement.  Employees  who met certain age and service  requirements
remained  in the defined  benefit  pension  plan.  In August  2000,  the Company
amended the Plan to provide  additional  benefits to certain  former  employees.
This  amendment  increased the Company's  obligations  under the Plan by $3,945,
which will be amortized against income over approximately 17 years.

The Company also has an unfunded nonqualified supplementary benefit plan through
which the Company provides  supplemental pension payments in excess of qualified
plan payments  including payments in excess of limits imposed by federal tax law
and other benefits.  The plan covers certain current and former officers and key
employees.

In addition,  the Company  participates  in a  multiemployer  plan that provides
defined   benefits  to  certain   bargaining  unit   employees.   The  Company's
contributions to the  multiemployer  plan totaled $357, $344, and $293 for 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

Postretirement  Health  and  Life:  The  Company  provides  postretirement  life
insurance  benefits to certain  employees  who retired prior to July 1, 1999 and
all  non-organized  salaried and hourly employees who participate in the defined
benefit pension plan. The Company previously  provided health insurance benefits
to  designated  salaried and hourly  employees who  participated  in the defined
benefit pension plan and who retired prior to January 1, 1992. Effective July 1,
2001,  the  Company  amended its  postretirement  benefit  plans and  terminated
postretirement  health  insurance  for all  existing  retirees.  This  amendment
decreased  the  Company's  postretirement  obligation  by $1,684,  which will be
amortized  into income over  approximately  five  years.  The Company  funds the
postretirement benefits on a cash basis.

The  Company  also  sponsors a 401(k)  profit  sharing  plan for the  benefit of
substantially all domestic salaried employees.  The Company provides a 25% match
on employee  contributions up to 6% of eligible  compensation and a supplemental
savings match from 1% to 35% based on the Company  achieving a minimum return on
shareholders' equity and subject to IRS limitations. Matching contributions made
by the  Company  totaled  $596,  $734,  and  $369  for  2001,  2000,  and  1999,
respectively.

Included in  deferred  liabilities  at August 31,  2001 and 2000,  is an accrual
totaling  $10,804  and  $10,439,  respectively,  for  termination  benefits  for
Speedline employees. The liability is based on the employee's length of service,
position, and remuneration,  and is payable upon separation. There is no vesting
period or funding requirement associated with the liability.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
At August 31, 2001, the Company has committed to capital  expenditures of $6,744
in 2002, primarily for the Engineered Components segment.

The Company, as is normal for the industry in which it operates,  is involved in
certain legal proceedings and subject to certain claims and site  investigations
which  arise  under  the  environmental  laws and  which  have not been  finally
adjudicated.

The Company has been  identified as a potentially  responsible  party by various
state agencies and by the United States  Environmental  Protection  Agency (U.S.
EPA) under the Comprehensive  Environmental  Response Compensation and Liability
Act of 1980, as amended,  for costs  associated  with U.S.  EPA-led  multi-party
sites and state  environmental  agency-led  remediation  sites.  The majority of
these claims involve  third-party owned disposal sites for which compensation is
sought  from the  Company as an alleged  waste  generator  for  recovery of past
governmental  costs or for  future  investigation  or  remedial  actions  at the
multi-party   sites.   There   are   three   Company-owned    properties   where
state-supervised   cleanups  are  expected  or  are  currently   underway.   The
designation as a potentially  responsible party and the assertion of such claims
against the Company are made  without  taking into  consideration  the nature or
extent of the Company's involvement with the particular site. In most instances,
claims  have  been  asserted  against a number  of other  entities  for the same
recovery or other relief as was asserted  against the Company.  These claims are
in various stages of administrative or judicial  proceeding.  The Company has no
reason  to  believe  that it will have to pay a  significantly  disproportionate
share of clean-up costs associated with any site. To the extent  possible,  with
the   information   available  at  the  time,  the  Company  has  evaluated  its
responsibility  for costs and related liability with respect to the above sites.
In making  such  evaluation,  the Company  did not take into  consideration  any
possible cost reimbursement  claims against its insurance carriers.  The Company
is of the opinion that its liability with respect to those sites should not have
a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. In
arriving at this  conclusion,  the principal  factors  considered by the Company
were ongoing  settlement  discussions  with respect to certain of the sites, the
volume and relative  toxicity of waste  alleged to have been  disposed of by the
Company at certain sites, which factors are often used to allocate investigative
and remedial

<PAGE>

costs among potentially  responsible  parties,  the probable costs to be paid by
other  potentially  responsible  parties,  total projected  remedial costs for a
site, if known,  and the Company's  existing  reserve to cover costs  associated
with  unresolved  environmental  proceedings.  At August 31, 2001, the Company's
accrued undiscounted reserve for such contingencies was $2,855.

Based upon the  contracts  and  agreements  with  regards  to two  environmental
matters,  the Company believes it is entitled to indemnity for remediation costs
at two  sites  and  believes  it is  probable  that the  Company  can  recover a
substantial  portion  of  the  costs.  Accordingly,  the  Company  has  recorded
receivables of $1,115 related to anticipated recoveries from third parties.

Allied-Signal Inc. (now Honeywell  International)  brought an action against the
Company  seeking  a  contribution  from the  Company  equal to 50% of  Honeywell
International's  estimated $30,000 remediation cost in connection with a site in
southern Ohio. The Company believes its responsibility with respect to this site
is very  limited due to the nature of the  foundry  sand waste it disposed of at
the site. The court has rendered its decision on this case,  however,  the exact
amount of the verdict has not yet been determined by the court.  The amount will
be  significantly  less than the amount  sought by the plaintiff and the Company
estimates  its  liability  associated  with the  action to be  between  $500 and
$1,500. The Company believes its liability is at the low end of this range.

In prior years,  the Company had recorded a liability for a legal claim asserted
by  former  employees  at its  Flagg  Brass  operations.  Due to the  terms of a
settlement,  a liability  in the amount of $2,226 was reversed in 2000 through a
reduction in SG&A expense.


MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND CREDIT CONCENTRATION
The Company  sells  products to  customers  primarily  in the United  States and
Europe.  The Company  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations  of customers,  and
generally does not require  collateral.  Allowances are maintained for potential
credit  losses and such losses have been within  management's  expectations.  On
August  31,  2001,  total  trade  receivables  from  the  domestic  and  foreign
automotive  industry  were  $44,082,  and $13,150 was due from the  construction
industry.

Sales to the Company's largest customer, General Motors, were $127,294, $157,099
and $136,469 for the years ended August 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,  respectively.
Trade  receivables  from General Motors on August 31, 2001 and 2000, were $5,895
and $7,845,  respectively,  and were current. No other single customer accounted
for a material portion of trade receivables.


PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
Under the  Company's  Shareholder  Rights Plan, as amended on February 24, 1998,
holders of common shares have one preferred share purchase right  (collectively,
the Rights) for each common  share held.  The Rights  contain  features,  which,
under  defined  circumstances,  allow  holders to buy common shares at a bargain
price.  The Rights are not  presently  exercisable  and trade in tandem with the
common shares. The Rights become exercisable  following the close of business on
the  earlier  of (i) the 20th day after a public  announcement  that a person or
group has acquired  15% or more of the common  shares of the Company or (ii) the
date  designated  by the Company's  board of directors.  It is expected that the
Rights will begin to trade  independently of the Company's common shares at that
time. Unless renewed, the Rights expire on February 23, 2008.

The Company has foreign net operating loss  carryforwards  totaling $27,442,  of
this total,  $16,601  will expire in years 2002 through 2006 and $10,841 have an
unlimited  carryforward.  The  Company  also has  domestic  net  operating  loss
carryforwards  totaling  $40,977,  of  which  $20,535  relate  to  current  year
operations  and  $20,442  were  recorded  as  part  of  the  Izumi,  Inc.  stock
acquisition.  The domestic net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2022.
In addition,  the Company has income tax credits of $1,069  expiring in 2021 and
an alternative  minimum tax credit of $4,720 that has an unlimited  carryforward
period. For financial reporting  purposes,  a valuation allowance of $13,401 has
been   recognized   to  offset  the  deferred   tax  assets   related  to  those
carryforwards.  Of the $13,401  valuation  allowance,  $7,155 relates to the net
operating loss  carryforwards  associated with the purchase of the remaining 40%
share in CTC and $6,246 is associated with foreign operations.

Income taxes paid by the Company  totaled  $1,905,  $4,342,  and $7,000 in 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively.

Undistributed  earnings of the Company's foreign  subsidiaries are considered to
be permanently reinvested and, accordingly,  no provisions for U.S. income taxes
have been  provided  thereon.  It is not practical to determine the deferred tax
liability for temporary differences related to these undistributed earnings.


STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has two plans under which stock  options for the  purchase of common
shares can be granted.  The 1999 Stock  Incentive Plan provides for the granting
of options for the purchase of a maximum of 425,000 shares,  stock  appreciation
rights,  performance awards, and restricted stock awards to key employees of the
Company.  Options  awarded  under the plan may not be granted at an option price
less than the fair  market  value of a share on the date the option is  granted,
and the  maximum  term of an  option  may not  exceed  ten  years.  All  options
currently  granted  under the plan are  exercisable  one year  after the date of
grant.

The 1999 Director Stock Option Plan provides for the granting of options for the
purchase of a maximum of 150,000 shares.  Under the plan, each person serving as
a director of the Company on the first business day of January of each year, who
is not  employed  by the  Company,  is  automatically  granted  options  for the
purchase of 1,500  shares.  All options were granted at an option price equal to
the  fair  market  value  of a  share  on the  date of  grant.  Each  option  is
exercisable  one year after the date of grant and the maximum  term of an option
may not exceed ten years.

Certain options also remain  outstanding and exercisable from prior stock option
plans.  In addition,  two executive  officers  received a total of 280,000 stock
options as an inducement to their  employment  at an average  exercise  price of
$8.89.

The Company has elected to adopt the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,"  and continue to apply  Accounting
Principles  Board Opinion No. 25 and related  interpretations  in accounting for
its stock option plans.  Accordingly,  no compensation  cost has been recognized
related to the Company's  stock option plans.  Consistent with the provisions of
SFAS 123, had  compensation  cost been determined based on the fair value at the
grant date for awards in fiscal 2001,  2000, and 1999 the Company's net loss and
net loss per share would be increased for 2001 and net income and net income per
share would be reduced for 2000 and 1999 as follows:

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Operating  segments are organized  internally  primarily by the type of products
produced and markets  served,  and in accordance  with SFAS No. 131, the Company
has aggregated  similar operating  segments into two reportable  segments:  Flow
Control Products and Engineered Components. The Flow Control Products segment is
a supplier of copper and brass plumbing fittings for the industrial,  commercial
and residential construction markets, and cast and fabricated metal products for
sale to original equipment  manufacturers in the  transportation,  construction,
air conditioning and refrigeration industries. The Engineered Components segment
is a supplier of aluminum wheels and aluminum automotive  components,  primarily
for  automotive  original  equipment  manufacturers.  During  2001,  the Company
reevaluated  the  composition of the reportable  segments and  reclassified  one
business from Engineered Components to Flow Control Products. Prior year segment
information was restated to conform to the 2001 presentation.

The Company  evaluates  segment  performance  and allocates  resources  based on
several  factors,  of which net  sales  and  operating  income  are the  primary
financial  measures.  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the
same as those described in the footnote  entitled  "Accounting  Policies" of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no intersegment sales.
