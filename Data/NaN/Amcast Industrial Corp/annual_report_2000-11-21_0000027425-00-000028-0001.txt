ITEM 1 - BUSINESS


       Amcast Industrial Corporation,  an Ohio corporation incorporated in 1869,
and its subsidiaries (called collectively "Amcast" or the "Company") are engaged
in the  business of  producing  fabricated  metal  products and cast and tubular
metal products in a variety of shapes,  sizes,  and metals for sale to end users
directly,  through sales representatives and distributor  organizations,  and to
original equipment manufacturers.  The Company serves three major sectors of the
economy: automotive,  construction, and industrial. Manufacturing facilities are
located in the United States of America, primarily in the Midwest, and in Italy.

       During fiscal 1998, the Company  acquired Lee Brass  Company,  located in
Anniston,  Alabama;  ceased operations at Flagg Brass,  Inc.,  located in Stowe,
Pennsylvania;  and during fiscal 1999,  sold Superior Valve Company,  located in
Washington,  Pennsylvania.  See further  discussion in "Flow  Control  Products"
below.  During fiscal 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Speedline  S.p.A.  and  its   subsidiaries   ("Speedline"),   a  major  European
manufacturer  located in Italy and during  fiscal  1998,  sold Amcast  Precision
Products  Inc.  in Rancho  Cucamonga,  California.  See  further  discussion  in
"Engineered Components" below.

       The  Company  operates  in two  business  segments  -- (1)  Flow  Control
Products and (2) Engineered  Components.  Information  concerning the net sales,
operating profit,  and identifiable  assets of each segment and sales by product
category for years 1998 through 2000 appears  under  "Business  Segments" in the
Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in the Company's  Annual Report to
Shareholders   for  the  year  ended  August  31,  2000.  Such   information  is
incorporated herein by reference and is included as Exhibit 13.1 of this report.
Domestic  export sales were $16.1 million,  $18.0 million,  and $33.4 million in
fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.


FLOW CONTROL PRODUCTS

       The Flow Control Products segment (Flow Control)  includes the businesses
of Elkhart Products  Corporation  (Elkhart),  Lee Brass Company (Lee Brass), and
Amcast  Industrial Ltd. Elkhart produces a complete line of wrot copper fittings
for use in  residential,  commercial,  and industrial  construction  and markets
brass pipe fittings. Lee Brass manufactures cast brass products for residential,
commercial,  and  industrial  plumbing  systems as well as  specific  cast brass
components unique to the application of original equipment manufacturers. Amcast
Industrial Ltd. is the Canadian marketing channel for the Company's Flow Control
segment manufacturing units.

       The Flow Control  Products  segment is a leading  supplier of copper pipe
fittings for the industrial,  commercial,  and residential construction markets.
These  products are sold through  distributors  and  wholesalers.  Shipments are
primarily  made by truck from  Company  locations  directly  to  customers.  The
competition  is  comprised  of a  number  of  manufacturers  of  parts  for  air
conditioning,  refrigeration,  and plumbing  systems.  The Company believes that
competition  in this segment is based on a number of factors  including  product
quality, service, delivery, and value.

       The Flow  Control  Products  segment is one of three major  suppliers  of
copper fittings  to the North  American industrial, commercial,  and residential
plumbing  markets.  Products are sold  primarily  through  plumbing wholesalers,
retail hardware stores and home centers, and to original equipment manufacturers
and replacement parts distributors in the air

FLOW CONTROL PRODUCTS (cont'd)
---------------------

conditioning  and  commercial  refrigeration  business.  Competition is based on
service levels,  pricing,  and breadth of product offering.  The Company's prime
competitors are Mueller Industries, Inc., a publicly-owned company listed on the
New York Stock Exchange,  and NIBCO Inc., a privately-held company headquartered
in Elkhart,  Indiana.  Both  Mueller  Industries,  Inc.  and NIBCO Inc. may have
greater financial resources than the Company.

       On  April  9,  1998,   the  Company   acquired  Lee  Brass   Company,   a
privately-owned  company  located  in  Anniston,  Alabama.  Lee Brass is a major
manufacturer of cast brass products for residential,  commercial, and industrial
plumbing systems.  The purchase price was approximately $16.1 million consisting
of cash payments of $11.7 million and debt assumption of $4.4 million.

       Following the acquisition of Lee Brass, the Company  consolidated its two
brass foundry  operations and ceased production at its Flagg Brass plant located
in Stowe, Pennsylvania.  The consolidation plan included the transfer of certain
product  lines to Lee Brass,  the closure of the Flagg Brass  facility,  and the
termination of approximately 100 salaried and hourly personnel.

       On October 16, 1998,  the Company sold  Superior  Valve Company for $35.6
million in cash.  The  transaction  resulted in a pre-tax gain of $9.0  million.
This business, acquired by Amcast in 1986, produces specialty valves and related
products for the compressed gas and commercial  refrigeration  markets.  Results
for 1999  and 1998  included  sales  for   Superior  Valve of approximately $4.6
million and  $42.0 million, respectively, in the Company's Flow Control Segment.

       The majority of the Flow Control Products  segment's business is based on
customer purchase orders for their current product requirements. Such orders are
filled  from   inventory   positions   maintained  in  the  regional   warehouse
distribution network. In certain situations, longer-term supply arrangements are
in place with major customers.  Such arrangements are of the type that stipulate
a  certain  percentage  of the  customer's  requirements  to be  delivered  at a
specific price over a set period of time.  Such  arrangements  are beneficial to
the  Company  in that they  provide  firm  forecasts  of demand  that  allow for
efficient use of equipment and manpower.

       See Properties at Item 2 of this report for  information on the Company's
facilities which operate in this segment.

ENGINEERED COMPONENTS

       The Engineered  Components  segment  produces cast and  fabricated  metal
products  principally for sale to original equipment  manufacturers and tier one
suppliers  in  the   transportation,   construction,   air   conditioning,   and
refrigeration  industries.  The Company's  manufacturing  processes  involve the
melting  of  raw   materials  for  casting  into  metal   products   having  the
configuration,  flexibility,  strength,  weight,  and  finish  required  for the
customer's  end use.  The Company  also custom  fabricates  copper and  aluminum
tubular   parts.   The  Company   manufactures   products   on  a   high-volume,
medium-volume,   and  specialized  basis  and  its  metal  capabilities  include
aluminum,  magnesium,  and copper.  Products  manufactured by the North American
operations  of this  segment  include  aluminum  castings  for  suspension,  air
conditioning  and anti-lock  braking  systems,  master  cylinders,  differential
carriers,  brake calipers and cast aluminum  wheels for use on  automobiles  and
light  trucks,  and  parts  for use in  heating  and air  conditioning  systems.
Delivery  is  mostly by truck  from  Amcast  locations  directly  to  customers.
Principal products manufactured by Speedline, in Italy, include aluminum  wheels
for  passenger  cars  and  trucks.  Speedline  also  manufactures  aluminum  and
magnesium racing wheels, aftermarket wheels, modular wheels and hubcaps.

       The  Engineered  Components  segment is not solely  dependent on a single
customer;  however, a significant portion of the Engineered  Components business
is directly or indirectly  dependent on the automobile  manufacturing  industry.
The Company's net sales to various divisions of General Motors  Corporation were
$157.1 million,  $136.5 million,  and $105.7 million for fiscal 2000,  1999, and
1998,   respectively.   No  other  customer  accounted  for  more  than  10%  of
consolidated sales.

ENGINEERED COMPONENTS (cont'd)
---------------------

       The  Engineered  Components  segment is a leading  supplier  of  aluminum
automotive  components  and aluminum  wheels for automotive  original  equipment
manufacturers in North America and also a leading supplier of light-alloy wheels
for automotive original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket  applications in
Europe.  Competition  in the  automotive  components  industry  is  global  with
numerous  competitors.   The  basis  of  competition  is  generally  design  and
engineering capability, price, product quality, and delivery.

       There  are  approximately  25  competitors  in  the  aluminum  automotive
component  business  serving the North American  market.  Principal  competitors
include Alcoa,  Hayes Lemmerz  International,  Inc., Stahl Specialty  Company, a
subsidiary  of the Budd Co.,  Contech,  a  subsidiary  of SPX  Corporation,  and
Citation  Corporation,  some  of  which  have  significantly  greater  financial
resources than the Company.

       There are approximately 18 producers of aluminum wheels which service the
North   American   market.   The  largest  of  these  are  Superior   Industries
International,  Inc.  and Hayes  Lemmerz  International,  Inc.  The next tier of
suppliers  includes  the Company,  Alcoa,  and Enkei  America  Inc.  Some of the
Company's  competitors in the aluminum wheel business have significantly greater
financial resources than the Company.

       There are  approximately  15  competitors  in the aluminum and  magnesium
automotive  wheel business serving the European  market.  Principal  competitors
include  Hayes  Lemmerz  International,  Inc.,  Ronal,  ATS,  and  Alloy  Wheels
International  (AWI),  some of which may have  significantly  greater  financial
resources than the Company.

       The Company  operates on a "blanket"  order basis and generally  supplies
all of the customer's annual requirements for a particular part. Customers issue
firm releases and shipping  schedules  each month  against their blanket  orders
depending on their current needs.  As a result,  order backlog varies from month
to month and is not considered firm beyond a 30-day period.

       Effective March 30, 1998, the Company sold Amcast Precision Products Inc.
(Precision), its Rancho Cucamonga,  California investment casting operation, for
$25.4  million.  Precision  produces  ferrous and  nonferrous  castings  for the
aerospace   industry.   Results  for  1998  included   sales  for  Precision  of
approximately $13.1 million in the Company's Engineered Components segment. This
was Amcast's only operation in the aerospace industry.

       See Properties at Item 2 of this report for  information on the Company's
facilities which operate in this segment.

GENERAL INFORMATION

       Aluminum and copper,  the essential  raw  materials to the business,  are
commodity-based  metals  purchased  from worldwide  sources of supply.  Supplier
selection is based upon quality, delivery,  reliability, and price. Availability
of these materials is judged to be adequate. The Company does not anticipate any
material shortage that will alter production schedules during the coming year.

       Aluminum  and  copper  are  basic  commodities  traded  in  international
markets.  Changes in aluminum and copper costs are generally  passed  through to
the customer.  In North  America,  changes in the cost of aluminum are currently
passed through to the customer based on various formulas as is the custom in the
automotive industry sector the Company serves. In Europe, changes in the cost of
aluminum  are  currently  passed  through  to  approximately  two-thirds  of the
customers based upon various formulas and through negotiated  contracts with the
remaining  customers.  Copper cost increases and decreases are generally  passed
through to the customer in the form of price  changes as permitted by prevailing
market  conditions.  The Company is unable to project  whether  these costs will
increase or decrease in the future.  The  Company's  ability to pass through any
increased  costs to the  customer  in the future  will be  determined  by market
conditions at that time.


<PAGE>


GENERAL INFORMATION (cont'd)
-------------------

       The Company owns a number of patents and patent applications  relating to
the design of its products. While the Company considers, in the aggregate, these
patents are important to operations, it believes that the successful manufacture
and sale of its products  generally  depend more on the Company's  technological
know-how and manufacturing skills.

       Capital expenditures related to compliance with federal, state, and local
environmental  protection  regulations for fiscal 2001 and 2002 are not expected
to  be  material.   Management   believes  that   operating   costs  related  to
environmental  protection  will not have a materially  adverse  effect on future
earnings or the Company's competitive position in the industry.

       The Company employed  approximately 4,530, 4,960, and 4,500 associates at
August 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

       In general, sales and production in  the automotive industry are cyclical
and vary based on the timing  of  consumer  purchases  of  vehicles and  overall
economic  strength. Production  schedules  can vary  significantly from  quarter
to quarter to meet customer demands.

      Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995

         Certain statements in this Report, in the Company's press releases, and
in oral  statements  made by or with the  approval  of an  authorized  executive
officer of the Company constitute  "forward-looking  statements" as that term is
defined under the Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995. These may
include statements  projecting,  forecasting,  or estimating Company performance
and industry trends. The achievement of the projections, forecasts, or estimates
is subject to certain  risks and  uncertainties.  Actual  results and events may
differ materially from those projected,  forecasted, or estimated. Factors which
may cause actual results to differ  materially  from those  contemplated  by the
forward-looking  statement include,  among others:  general economic  conditions
less  favorable than expected,  fluctuating  demand in the automotive  industry,
less favorable than expected growth in sales and profit margins in the Company's
product  lines,  increased  competitive  pressures in the  Company's  Engineered
Components  and Flow Control  Products  segments,  effectiveness  of  production
improvement  plans,  inherent  uncertainties  in connection  with  international
operations and foreign currency  fluctuations and labor relations at the Company
and its customers.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

       Certain legal matters are described at "Commitments and Contingencies" in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company's Annual Report to
Shareholders  for the year ended August 31,  2000,  which is included in Exhibit
13.1 to this Report and incorporated herein by reference.

     Allied  Signal,  Inc. (now Honeywell) has brought a superfund private  cost
recovery  and  contribution  action  against  the Company in  the  United States
District Court for the Southern  District of Ohio,  Western  Division,  which is
captioned  Allied-Signal,  Inc.  V.  Amcast  Industrial  Corporation  (Case  No.
C-3-92-013).  The action involves the Goldcamp  Disposal Site in Ironton,  Ohio.
Honeywell has taken the lead in remediating the site and has estimated that  its
total costs for the

remediation may reach $30 million. Honeywell is seeking a contribution  from the
Company in an amount  equal to 50% of the final  remediation  costs.  A trial in
this proceeding was completed in February 1995. The trial court recently entered
a "short  form"  opinion on the  merits.  The Court  stated  that the Company is
responsible  for 2% of Honeywell's  past and future clean-up costs, and that the
Company is  responsible  for 28% of the costs that Honeywell incurred to place a
"cap" on the Goldcamp  Disposal  site. The Court also ordered the Company to pay
pre-judgment  interest.  Based on the Court's action, the Company estimates that
its maximum  liability  associated  with the action is between  $0.5 million and
$1.5  million.  The Court has not  entered a "final"  order and any final  order
could be subject to appeal. The Company believes its liability is at the low end
of this range.
