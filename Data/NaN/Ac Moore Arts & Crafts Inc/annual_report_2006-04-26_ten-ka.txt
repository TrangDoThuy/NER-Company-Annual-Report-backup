DIRECTOR NOMINATION PROCESS

         Director Qualifications. Nominees for director will be selected on the
basis of outstanding achievement in their careers; broad experience; education;
independence under applicable Nasdaq Stock Market and SEC rules; financial
expertise; integrity; financial integrity; ability to make independent,
analytical inquiries; understanding of the business environment; and willingness
to devote adequate time to Board of Directors and committee duties. Nominees
should also have experience in the retail industry and knowledge about the
issues affecting the retail industry. Finally, the proposed nominee should be
free of conflicts of interest that could prevent such nominee from acting in the
best interest of shareholders. Additional special criteria apply to directors
being considered to serve on a particular committee of the Board of Directors.
For example, members of the Audit Committee must meet additional standards of
independence and have the ability to read and understand our financial
statements.

         Director Nominee Selection Process. In the case of an incumbent
director whose term of office expires, the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee reviews such director's service to us during the past term, including,
but not limited to, the number of board and committee meetings attended, as
applicable, quality of participation and whether the candidate continues to meet
the general qualifications for a director outlined above, including the
director's independence, as well as any special qualifications required for
membership on any committees on which such director serves.

         In the case of a new director candidate, the selection process for
director candidates includes the following steps:

         o  identification of director candidates by the Nominating and
            Corporate Governance Committee based upon suggestions from current
            directors and executives and recommendations received from
            shareholders;

         o  possible engagement of a director search firm;

         o  interviews of candidates by the Nominating and Corporate Governance
            Committee;

         o  reports to the Board of Directors by the Nominating and Corporate
            Governance Committee on the selection process;

         o  recommendations by the Nominating and Corporate Governance
            Committee; and

         o  formal nominations by the Board of Directors for inclusion in the
            slate of directors at the annual meeting.

         The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider
recommending properly submitted shareholder nominations for director candidates.
Director candidates recommended by shareholders are given the same consideration
by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as candidates suggested by
directors and executive officers.

         Consideration of Director Candidates Recommended by Shareholders. A
shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective director nominee should submit
their recommendation to the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance

     granted based on assumed annual compound stock appreciation rates of 5% and
     10% over the full term of the options. The 5% and 10% assumed rates of
     appreciation are mandated by the rules of the SEC and do not represent our
     estimate or projection of future Common Stock prices. The gains shown are
     net of the option exercise price, but do not include deductions for taxes
     or other expenses associated with the exercise of the option or the sale of
     the underlying shares, or reflect non-transferability, vesting or
     termination provisions. The actual gains, if any, on the exercise of stock
     options will depend on the future performance of the Common Stock.

         2006 BONUS PLAN

         On February 20, 2006, the Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors approved the 2006 Bonus Plan, which is not set forth in a written
agreement, for certain management-level employees, including the Named Executive
Officers. Under the 2006 Bonus Plan, if we achieve certain pre-tax profit
targets approved by the Compensation Committee, we will pay bonuses to eligible
participants at pre-determined amounts which increase as our pre-tax profit
increases. The amounts paid to eligible participants vary based upon that
participant's job responsibility. The pre-tax profit targets approved by the
Compensation Committee are based on our net income.

         2005 BONUS PLAN

         On April 19, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved the 2005 Bonus
Plan, which is not set forth in a written agreement, for certain
management-level employees, including the Named Executive Officers. Under the
2005 Bonus Plan, if the Company achieved certain pre-tax profit targets approved
by the Compensation Committee, the Company would pay bonuses to eligible
participants at pre-determined amounts which increase as the Company's pre-tax
profit increases. The amounts paid to eligible participants vary based upon that
participant's job responsibility. The pre-tax profit targets approved by the
Compensation Committee were based on the Company's pre-tax profit before any
potential impact from the expensing of stock-based compensation as a result of
FASB Statement No. 123(R). None of our executive officers received bonus
compensation under the 2005 Bonus Plan because we did not meet the targets
approved by the Compensation Committee.

         SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENT

         We have agreed to pay Mr. Gordon a sum equal to one year of his then
current salary if his employment is terminated by us without cause.

         STOCK OPTION PLANS

         Our stock option plans consist of the 2002 Stock Option Plan (the "2002
Plan") and the 1997 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Option Plan (the
"1997 Plan") (each, a "Plan" and together, the "Option Plans"). The purpose of
the Option Plans is to encourage ownership of the Common Stock by our employees
and directors (and by certain consultants in the case of the 1997 Plan) in order
to attract such persons, induce them to work for our benefit and provide
additional incentive for them to promote our success. Options granted under each
Plan may be incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or options not intended to so
qualify, except that incentive stock options may only be granted to employees.
The maximum total number of shares of the Common Stock for which awards may be
granted under the 2002 Plan and 1997 Plan is 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 shares,
respectively, subject to adjustment in a manner determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors to reflect changes in the Common Stock.
Payment of the exercise price for options granted under the Option Plans may be
made in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of both. All options
granted pursuant to the Plans are exercisable in accordance with a vesting
schedule and prior to an expiration date, each of which are set at the time of
the issuance of the option.

         As of December 31, 2005, there were options to purchase 858,266 and
626,801 shares of Common Stock outstanding under the 2002 Plan and 1997 Plan,
respectively. Shares available for future grants under the 2002 Plan and 1997
Plan amounted to 627,283 and 9,877 shares, respectively, as of December 31,
2005.

                                       11
<PAGE>

         All, directors, officers and key employees (and certain consultants in
the case of the 1997 Plan) are eligible to receive options under the Option
Plans. The Options Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee or, at
the option of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors may administer the
Option Plans. The Compensation Committee approves the optionees and determines
the nature of the option granted, the number of shares subject to each option,
the option vesting schedule and other terms and conditions of each option. The
Compensation Committee may modify or amend each Plan, provided that without the
consent of the participant, such action may not affect a participant's rights
under previously granted options. With the consent of a participant, the
Compensation Committee may amend outstanding options in a manner not
inconsistent with the applicable Plan.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

         In 2005, the compensation payable to all of our non-employee directors,
other than William Kaplan, was as follows:

         o  An annual cash retainer of $30,000;

         o  An additional annual cash retainer of $12,500 for the chair of the
            Audit Committee and $5,000 for each other member of the Audit
            Committee;

         o  An additional annual cash retainer of $5,000 for the chair of the
            Compensation Committee and $2,500 for each other member of the
            Compensation Committee;

         o  An additional annual cash retainer of $3,500 for the chair of the
            Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and $2,500 for each
            other member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee;
            and

         o  An additional annual cash retainer of $100,000 for our former Lead
            Director, Eli J. Segal.

Mr. Kaplan did not receive any compensation in 2005 for serving as a member of
our Board of Directors. Ms. Schafer's compensation was pro-rated based upon the
portion of the year during which she served as a director.

         Effective January 1, 2006, the compensation payable to all of our
non-employee directors is as follows:

         o  An annual cash retainer of $30,000;

         o  An additional annual cash retainer of $15,000 for the chair of the
            Audit Committee and $5,000 for each other member of the Audit
            Committee;

         o  An additional annual cash retainer of $5,000 for the chair of the
            Compensation Committee and $2,500 for each other member of the
            Compensation Committee; and

         o  An additional annual cash retainer of $3,500 for the chair of the
            Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and $2,500 for each
            other member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Michael J. Joyce will also receive a $25,000 fee in 2006 for his services as
chair of the board committee conducting a search for our new Chief Executive
Officer. Eli J. Segal, Lead Director, passed away on February 20, 2006. In


                                       12
<PAGE>


consideration of Mr. Segal's prior services as our Lead Director, on March 9,
2006, the Board of Directors approved an award to Mr. Segal's estate of a death
benefit equal to $50,000 in cash. In addition, the Board of Directors agreed to
have us continue to pay the expenses related to Mr. Segal's secretary for a
period of two months from the date of his death.

       Stock Options. Messrs. Bauer, Drake, Joyce, Lesser and Segal and Ms.
Schafer, each a non-employee director of us in 2005, were each granted an option
to acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock in 2005 under our 2002 Stock Option
Plan. In 2006, non-employee directors will each receive an annual stock option
grant pursuant to our 2002 Stock Option Plan. The amount of shares subject to
the option grant and the exercise price are expected to be determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in August 2006.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

         The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors consisted of
Messrs. Bauer, Joyce, Lesser and Segal in 2005. No person who served as a member
of the Compensation Committee during 2005 was a current or former officer or
employee of us or, except as described below in Item 13 of this Form 10-K/A,
engaged in certain transactions with us required to be disclosed by regulations
of the SEC. Additionally, there were no compensation committee "interlocks"
during 2005, which generally means that none of our executive officers served as
a director or member of the compensation committee of another entity, one of
whose executive officers served as a director or member of the Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors.

and $58,825 in 2003. Ms. Kott is the daughter of Jack Parker and Patricia A.

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES

         Aggregate fees for professional services rendered for us by

</TABLE>

--------------
(1)  The aggregate fees included in Audit fees are fees billed for the fiscal
     years. The aggregate fees included in each of the other categories are fees
     billed in the fiscal years.

         Audit fees for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, were for professional services rendered for the audits of our
consolidated financial statements, and for the audit of our internal control
over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
quarterly reviews, issuance of consents, and assistance with review of documents
filed with the SEC.

         Audit related fees for the year ended December 31, 2004 were for
assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of
the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements and are not
reported under "Audit Fees."

         Tax fees for the year ended December 31, 2004 were for services
relating to tax advice and tax planning other than those directly related to the
audit of the income tax accrual.

         The Audit Committee has considered and determined that the services
provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers are compatible with PricewaterhouseCoopers
maintaining its independence.

         The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that requires advance approval
of all audit, audit related, tax services and other services performed by the
independent registered public accounting firm. The policy provides for
pre-approval by the Audit Committee of specifically defined audit and non-audit
services. Unless the specific service has been previously pre-approved with
respect to that year, the Audit Committee must approve the permitted service
before the independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to perform
it. The Audit Committee pre-approved all of the audit and non-audit services
provided to us by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2005 and 2004.
