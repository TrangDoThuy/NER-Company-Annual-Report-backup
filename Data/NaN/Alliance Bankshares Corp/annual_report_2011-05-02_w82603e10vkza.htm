</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors with respect to
executive compensation is to evaluate and reward senior executives for performance consistent with
improving long-term shareholder value. The committee evaluates each executive&#146;s individual
performance along with his contribution to the overall organization. The Chief Executive Officer
provides specific information to the committee relative to the performance of the other members of
the senior management team. The committee considers any recommendations by the Chief Executive
Officer; however, the committee determines final compensation for all executives. The core
compensation philosophy maintained by the committee and the full Board of Directors is a reward
system for achievement. Executives that achieve individual goals are eligible for certain financial
rewards. Corporate achievement of organizational goals such as profitability, growth and market
expansion warrant additional rewards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Compensation Components and Committee Process</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key components of our executive compensation program consist of base salary, annual cash
bonus program, stock option awards, perquisites and employee benefits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee recommends the level of compensation for each executive officer of
Bankshares and the Bank the granting of stock options, employment agreements and other remuneration
plans for approval by the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee is supported by members of
management (Human Resources Director, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer). These
executive officers provide supporting information requested by the Compensation Committee. The

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Base Salary</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee believes that base salary for senior executive officers should be
targeted at market competitive levels. Base salaries are reviewed annually and adjusted from time
to time, based on our review of market data and assessment of Bankshares&#146; and individual senior
executive performance. In light of Bankshares&#146; performance and the difficult conditions in the
financial services industry during 2009, the Compensation Committee determined not award any raises
to the executive officers for 2009 or 2010. The base salaries of the named executive officers
during 2008, 2009 and 2010 were as follows: Mr.&nbsp;Young $291,500, Mr.&nbsp;Harbolick $190,800, Mr.&nbsp;Grace
$195,517, Mr.&nbsp;Sacknoff $172,963 and Mr.&nbsp;McKenney $139,120. In connection with his hiring as Interim
President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr.&nbsp;Doyle&#146;s monthly salary equated to an annual base salary
of $291,500. In connection with his hiring as President and Chief Executive Officer, his annual
base salary was established at $299,500 in 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of the fact that they had not received base salary increases since 2007, and their
respective contributions and performance, effective March&nbsp;7, 2011, the Compensation Committee
increased the base salaries for the named executive officers as follows: Mr.&nbsp;Harbolick $200,340,
Mr.&nbsp;Sacknoff $181,600 and Mr.&nbsp;McKenney $146,076. The Compensation Committee maintained Mr.&nbsp;Doyle&#146;s
base salary for 2011 at $299,500.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Annual Cash Bonus Program</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the annual cash program in 2010 was to align annual cash bonus incentives with
organizational performance and repositioning contributions. A second portion of the annual cash
bonus program was based on individual performance. The senior executives were measured on

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors and senior management believe aligning
the long term interests of key employees, directors and senior management with shareholders is a
key ingredient in the formula for organizational success. Over the years the Board of Directors
and/or the Compensation Committee have granted stock option awards under the 1999 Stock Option Plan
and the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan to align the long-term interests of key employees, directors and
senior management with shareholders. The Compensation Committee has also delegated to the President
and Chief Executive Officer authority to issue stock option awards to non-senior manager employees
of Bankshares to align their respective interests with shareholders. The Chief Executive Officer
may grant options to employees as necessary to recruit potential employees or to retain existing
employees. Although the Chief Executive Officer has authority to grant the options as necessary,
grants of more than 10,000 options are reviewed with the Compensation Committee prior to the grant
issuance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock option awards have traditionally been granted to employees with terms of ten years and a
vesting schedule of four years. The typical vesting schedule is 15% vesting after the first year,
20% vesting after the second year, 25% vesting after the third year and the final 40% vesting after
the fourth year. Stock option awards are granted at fair market value on the date of grant, which
has been determined by the Compensation Committee as the closing market price on the date of grant.
With the exception of option awards granted to new hires and any stock options granted to
non-senior manager employees by the Chief Executive Officer, stock option grants by the
Compensation Committee have traditionally been made at the committee&#146;s periodic meetings. The
committee&#146;s schedule is determined in advance, and the proximity of any equity awards to the
release of earnings announcements or other material news events is coincidental.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have entered into employment agreements with each of the named executive officers. We
believe employment agreements, including providing for reasonable severance in the event a named
executive officer&#146;s employment is terminated by us without cause, are necessary to allow us to be
competitive in recruiting and retaining talented executive officers in our industry. In addition,
we believe employment agreements with the named executive officers are appropriate because they
clarify the terms of the executives&#146; employment and ensure that Bankshares and its subsidiaries are
protected by non-compete, non-solicitation and non-disclosure provisions in the event the
executives leave the organization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our senior management has contributed significantly to our organization, and we believe that
it is important to protect them in the event of a change of control. Further, it is Bankshares&#146;
belief that the interests of shareholders will be best served if the interests of senior executives
are aligned with the interests of shareholders, and providing change of control benefits should
eliminate or substantially reduce any reluctance on the part of executive officers, because of

in the best interests of shareholders. Such arrangements also should keep executive officers
focused on operating the business during any period of uncertainty associated with transaction that
would result in a change of control. Each of the employment agreements for the named executive
officers contains change of control provisions. Unlike the accelerated vesting of equity awards
under the 1999 Stock Option Plan and the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan, these change of control
benefits have a &#147;double trigger,&#148; which means that the benefits under these provisions are payable
only if employment is terminated after consummation of a transaction that constitutes a change of
control.

appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Bankshares and the Bank effective May&nbsp;4, 2010,

January&nbsp;28, 2010. Mr.&nbsp;Doyle is employed under an agreement with Bankshares and the Bank, dated as
of May&nbsp;4, 2010. The agreement provides for Mr.&nbsp;Doyle&#146;s employment as President and Chief Executive
Officer of Bankshares and the Bank for an initial term through May&nbsp;4, 2012. On May&nbsp;4, 2012, and on
each May 4 thereafter, the agreement will automatically renew for an additional one year term,
unless a party provides at least 90&nbsp;days&#146; prior notice of nonrenewal. The agreement provides for an
initial annual base salary of $299,500 with an opportunity for base salary increases and bonuses at
the discretion of the Board of Directors. Mr.&nbsp;Doyle&#146;s current annual base salary is $299,500. Mr.
Doyle is eligible to participate in any employee benefit plans maintained by the company for the
benefit of its senior executives and for which he is or will become eligible, such as medical,
dental and optical insurance, group term life insurance, long term and short term disability
insurance, and the 401(k) retirement plan. Mr.&nbsp;Doyle is also provided with a company-owned
automobile for business and reasonable personal use during his employment. Under the agreement, Mr.
Doyle received a signing grant of 50,000 stock options pursuant to the terms of the 2007 Incentive
Stock Plan. In recognition that Mr.&nbsp;Doyle needed to relocate his personal residence from
Charlottesville, Virginia to Bankshares&#146; geographic location, the company agreed to reimburse Mr.
Doyle for the reasonable rent and utilities incurred while living in temporary housing in the
vicinity of the company for up to six months, limited to a maximum of $2,300 per month, grossed up
for taxes. The company also agreed to reimburse Mr.&nbsp;Doyle for necessary and reasonable moving
costs, subject to approval by Bankshares&#146; Board of Directors. If Mr.&nbsp;Doyle&#146;s employment is
terminated for any reason, he is entitled to payment of any vested but not yet paid benefits
provided under the agreement. If Mr.&nbsp;Doyle&#146;s employment is terminated by the company other than for

agreement), Mr.&nbsp;Doyle will continue to receive his then current monthly base salary for twelve
months following termination, subject to reduction in the event Mr.&nbsp;Doyle receives other income
during that period. If Mr.&nbsp;Doyle&#146;s employment is terminated by the company other than for cause or
if he resigns for good reason within one year after a change of control (as defined in the
agreement), he will receive 2.99 times his average taxable income from the company for the five
calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year of the change of control (with compensation
for any partial year of employment annualized) (the 5-year average taxable compensation), payable
in equal monthly installments over twelve months following the date of termination, but limited to
the maximum payment which could be made without any payment being considered an excess parachute

the executive&#146;s base salary, or 2.5 times the executive&#146;s base salary in the case of Mr.&nbsp;Cave.
Until January&nbsp;29, 2010, in the case of Mr.&nbsp;Young, the company also paid the premiums on two
additional life insurance policies owned by Mr.&nbsp;Young providing a death benefit equal to $300,000
each.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Compensation to be Paid Upon Disability or Termination Without Cause or For Good Reason</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under certain circumstances, either the executive or the company may desire to end his
employment for a reason which is not set forth above. Among other events in this category, the
company may terminate the executive&#146;s employment even if he has done nothing wrong, the executive
may resign from the company based on a &#147;good reason,&#148; or the company may determine that an
executive is unable to continue working for the company due to disability. Under the employment
agreements, if the executive is disabled (as defined in the agreement), the company will terminate
his employment 90&nbsp;days after notice of termination is provided to the executive. No additional
compensation is payable under the agreements in the case of termination due to disability. Under
the employment agreements, termination of an executive for any reason other than for cause, for
disability or as a result of the executive&#146;s death will entitle the executive to receive
termination compensation from the company. If the executive decides to terminate his employment,
then he is only entitled to receive termination compensation payments if he does so for &#147;good
reason,&#148; which means the company has changed certain aspects of his employment in a significant way
that is not acceptable to him or otherwise fails to fulfill a commitment the company had made to
him. In each of these circumstances, for twelve months in the case of Messrs.&nbsp;Doyle and Cave, and
for each month until the end of the term of the executive&#146;s employment agreement or twelve months
following the date of termination if longer

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">in the case of the other executives, the company will pay to the executive an amount equal to
one-twelfth of the annual salary which he was earning immediately before the termination. In the
event that the executive breaches the confidentiality, non-disclosure or non-competition
commitments which he made to the company in his employment agreement, then the company will no
longer be required to make these payments. These commitments generally last for twelve months after
termination of employment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Compensation to be Paid Upon Change of Control</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the employment agreements, a change of control is a significant change of the company&#146;s
business or management that fits into one of these categories: (1)&nbsp;another party becomes the owner
of enough of the company&#146;s securities to control at least 50% of the voting power under certain
circumstances; or (2)&nbsp;as a result of certain transactions, and within two years of the occurrence
of such transactions, the people who formerly constituted a majority of the Board no longer
constitute a majority of the Board. The executive&#146;s employment agreements provide that any
successor to the company, including an entity that becomes a successor as a result of a change of
control, must assume and agree to perform the company&#146;s obligations to the executives under the
individual employment agreements. If a successor does not assume and agree to perform the company&#146;s
obligations under the individual employment agreements, then the executives will be entitled to
terminate their employment for good reason and to receive the termination compensation described
above. In the case of Mr.&nbsp;Doyle&#146;s employment agreement, if within one year after a change of
control (as defined in the agreement) his employment is terminated by the company other than for
cause or he resigns for good reason, Mr.&nbsp;Doyle will be entitled to receive up to 2.99 times his
5-year average taxable compensation, payable in equal monthly installments over twelve months,
limited to the maximum payment which could be made without any payment being considered an excess
parachute payment under Section&nbsp;280G of the Internal Revenue Code. In the case of Mr.&nbsp;Harbolick,
if within one year after a change of control his employment is terminated by the company without
cause or he resigns for good reason, he will be entitled to an amount equal to two times his
&#147;compensation&#148; (defined in the agreement as current base salary plus the average of the last three
years&#146; bonus payments), payable in equal monthly installments over twenty-four months. In the case
of Messrs.&nbsp;Sacknoff, McKenney and Cave, if within one year after a change of control, the executive
officer is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason, he will be entitled to an amount
equal to 1.5 times his 5-year average taxable compensation, payable in equal monthly installments
over eighteen months for Messrs.&nbsp;Sacknoff and McKenney and twelve months in the case of Mr.&nbsp;Cave.
In the case of Mr.&nbsp;Young&#146;s former employment agreement, if within one year after a change of
control (as defined in the agreement) his employment had been terminated by the company other than
for cause or he resigned for good reason, Mr.&nbsp;Young would have received up to 2.99 times his 5-year
average taxable compensation, payable in equal monthly installments over thirty-six months, limited
to the maximum payment which could be made without any payment being considered an excess parachute
payment under Section&nbsp;280G of the Internal Revenue Code. In the case of Mr.&nbsp;Grace&#146;s former
employment agreement, if within one year after a change of control (as defined in the agreement)
his employment had been terminated by the company other than for cause or he resigned for good
reason, Mr.&nbsp;Grace would have received an amount equal to 1.5 times his 5-year average taxable
compensation, payable in equal monthly installments over twenty-four months.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1999 Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of stock options to our directors,
consultants and key employees. The 2007 Incentive Stock Plan provides for the grant of stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock awards to
our key employees, non-employee directors and non-employee service providers. As of April&nbsp;30, 2011,
only stock options have been granted under the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once granted under either the 1999 Stock Option Plan or the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan, options
can be exercised to purchase Bankshares&#146; common stock only in accordance with a vesting schedule
stated in each option award agreement and with the other terms of the individual grant. The
following summarizes the treatment of stock options upon certain events under the 1999 Stock Option
Plan and the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Treatment of Stock Options Upon Termination For Cause</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under both the 1999 Stock Option Plan and the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan, if a person&#146;s
employment or service is terminated by the company for cause, all of his stock options which have
not been exercised will immediately be forfeited. The definition of &#147;cause&#148; under the 1999 Stock
Option Plan is substantially similar to the definition of &#147;cause&#148; in the employment agreements
described above. The definition of &#147;cause&#148; under the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan is substantially the
same as the definition of &#147;cause&#148; in the 1999 Stock Option Plan, with the exception that the
definition of &#147;cause&#148; under the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan expressly refers to Bankshares&#146;
subsidiaries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Treatment of Stock Options Upon Death or Incapacity</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under both the 1999 Stock Option Plan and the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan, if a participant who
has received stock options dies while he is working for or providing services to the company or one
of its subsidiaries, his legal representative (usually his executor or administrator) has twelve
months to exercise those vested options which the deceased person could have exercised as of the
date of his death. Under both the 1999 Stock Option Plan and the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan, if a
participant who has received stock options becomes incapacitated while he is working for or
providing services to the company or one of its subsidiaries, his guardian or legal representative
also has twelve months following the date of incapacity to exercise those vested options which the
incapacitated person could have exercised as of the date of his incapacitation. After the 12-month
period, any options that have not been exercised will be forfeited.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Treatment of Stock Options Upon Termination For Any Other Reason</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employment or service of a person may end for a reason other than those set forth above.
Under both the 1999 Stock Option Plan and the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan, if termination occurs for
any other reason, such as retirement or resignation, a participant who has received stock options
has three months to exercise those vested options which he could have exercised as of the date his
employment or service ended. After the three-month period, any options which have not been
exercised will be forfeited.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Treatment of Stock Options Upon Change of Control</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the 1999 Stock Option Plan, a change of control is a significant change in our business
that fits into one of these categories: (1)&nbsp;Bankshares transfers all or almost all of its assets to
another party; (2)&nbsp;another party becomes the owner of more than 50% of Bankshares&#146; stock; or (3)
Bankshares is involved in a reorganization, a consolidation, or a merger with another party. If a
change of control occurs, then, regardless of the usual vesting schedule, an employee who has
received stock options may exercise all of his options, as long as the parties who own Bankshares&#146;
common stock immediately before the change of control are not the same parties who hold, either
directly or indirectly, a majority of the common stock of the acquiring party involved in the
change of control. If a change of control occurs, the committee appointed by the Board to
administer the 1999 Stock Option Plan may also take steps to protect those people who have received
options, including (i)&nbsp;changing the exercise dates or termination dates of the options so that a
person may exercise his options before the change of control; (ii)&nbsp;canceling the options a person
has received and instead paying him cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock
on the day the change of control occurs, minus the exercise price he would have had to pay to
exercise the options; or (iii)&nbsp;canceling the options a person has received and arranging for him to
receive equivalent options to purchase the stock of the acquiring party involved in the change of
control, so long as he receives substantially the same treatment under the substituted options that
he would have received under the original options. The Board may also take other steps in addition
to or instead of the steps set forth above to protect those people who have received options under
the 1999 Stock Option Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan, a change of control is a significant change in our
business that fits into one of these categories: (1)&nbsp;another party becomes the owner of 25% or more
of Bankshares&#146; stock; (2)&nbsp;within any two-year period, the composition of the Board changes so that
the directors who formerly constituted the Board no longer constitute a majority of the Board and
the new directors were not approved by a sufficient number of former directors; (3)&nbsp;as a result of
a merger or consolidation, Bankshares ceases to exist or Bankshares&#146; stock is converted into other
property; (4)&nbsp;as a result of a merger or consolidation, we continue to exist but the holders of
Bankshares&#146; stock immediately prior to the transaction do not own at least 51% of Bankshares&#146; stock
immediately following the transaction; (5)&nbsp;Bankshares transfers all or almost all of its assets to
another party; or (6)&nbsp;Bankshares&#146; shareholders approve the liquidation or dissolution of the
company. If a change of control occurs, then, regardless of the usual vesting schedule, a
participant who has received stock options may exercise all of his options. If a change of control
occurs, the committee appointed by the Board to administer the 2007 Incentive Stock Plan may also
take steps to protect those people who have received options, including (i)&nbsp;changing the exercise
dates or termination dates of the options so that a person may exercise his options before the
change of control; (ii)&nbsp;canceling the options a person has received and instead paying him cash in
an amount which could have been obtained upon the exercise of the option, had the option been
currently exercisable; (iii)&nbsp;adjusting the option in an appropriate way to reflect the change of
control; or (iv)&nbsp;causing the outstanding options to be assumed, or new rights substituted for those
options, by the acquiring or surviving party involved in the change of control.

executive officer&#146;s employment with us, whether due to retirement, death, disability, termination
for cause, termination with good reason, or termination in connection with a change of control. The
amounts shown assume in each case that the change of control or termination occurred on December
31, 2010, and that the relevant stock price was $3.89, which was the closing price of Bankshares&#146;
common stock on December&nbsp;31, 2010. Because Mr.&nbsp;Young and Mr.&nbsp;Grace were no longer serving as

    <TD>Chairman of the Board of Directors and the President and Chief Executive Officer
of the organizations. In the suit, Mr.&nbsp;Grace sought to void the non-compete and
non-solicitation provisions of his employment agreement with the Bank, and to collect
compensatory, pecuniary and punitive damages of up to $2.85&nbsp;million plus attorney fees and
costs in connection with his resignation of employment and other transactions with the Bank,
including forgiveness of certain loans and salary advances made to him during his employment.
Pursuant to a January&nbsp;26, 2011 settlement of the lawsuit brought by Mr.&nbsp;Grace, Alliance paid Mr.&nbsp;Grace $122,188 in severance and
$5,250 in reimbursement of claimed tax penalties and interest associated with a 401(k) plan loan,
cancelled a $95,000 promissory note made by Mr.&nbsp;Grace in favor of the Bank, paid $60,000
toward Mr.&nbsp;Grace&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees and paid $3,527 for Mr.&nbsp;Grace&#146;s portion of the mediation
fees in connection with the settlement. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement,
the provision of Mr.&nbsp;Grace&#146;s employment agreement requiring a post-resignation period of
non-competition was terminated and the provisions requiring post-resignation periods of
non-solicitation of customers and employees were shortened to six months and nine months,
respectively. As part of the settlement, Mr.&nbsp;Grace withdrew his lawsuit and the parties
mutually released each other from any and all related claims. An independent committee of the
Board of Directors approved the settlement.</TD>

the table does not include the value of vested but unexercised stock options as of December&nbsp;31,
2010. The footnotes to the table describe the assumptions used in estimating the amounts set forth
in the table. Because the payments to be made to a named executive officer depend on several
factors, the actual amounts to be paid out upon a named executive officer&#146;s termination of
employment can only be determined at the time of the executive&#146;s separation from Alliance.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Committee and the Compensation Committee jointly annually recommend to the full
Board of Directors the compensation to be paid to Bankshares&#146; non-employee directors. Employee
directors do not receive additional compensation for their board service.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, each non-employee director received an annual retainer of $7,650, with the
Chairman of the Board receiving an additional annual retainer of $7,650 and the Chairman of each of
the Audit Committee, Loan Committee, ALCO Committee (which is no longer a Board committee in 2011)
and Compensation Committee receiving an additional annual retainer of $2,975. The annual retainer
fees are paid on an annual basis in January of the year to which the fee is applicable. Each
non-employee director also received a monthly fee of $850.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the economic conditions and corporate performance the Board of Directors decided
to reduce the annual retainer and monthly compensation for 2010 to a level which represents 85% of
the director compensation paid during 2009. Directors will receive the same reduced level of
annual retainer and monthly compensation for 2011 as in 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each non-employee director is also eligible to receive non-qualified stock option awards

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors is comprised of a majority of &#147;independent&#148; directors, as defined by
the Nasdaq listing standards as currently in effect and applicable to Bankshares. Independent
directors do not receive consulting, legal or other fees from Bankshares or the Bank, other than
Board and committee compensation. Although companies affiliated with certain of these directors
provide goods and services to Bankshares and the Bank, the Board of Directors has determined in
accordance with the Nasdaq listing standards that these independent directors have no relationships
with Bankshares or the Bank that would interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment in
carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Board has determined that all current
directors are independent with the exception of Mr.&nbsp;Doyle. In determining each director&#146;s
independence, the Board considered the fact that Carr Properties, of which Mr.&nbsp;Carr serves as
President and CEO, leases the corporate headquarters to Bankshares under a lease that expires in
July&nbsp;2016, but determined that this relationship does not interfere with Mr.&nbsp;Carr&#146;s ability to
exercise independent judgment as a director of Bankshares, and also considered the fact that Lowers
&#038; Associates, LLC, of which Mr.&nbsp;Lowers serves as President and CEO, and Proforma Screening
Services, of which Mr.&nbsp;Lowers is an owner and director, periodically provide information technology
risk management and pre-employment background screening services, respectively, to the Bank, but
determined that these relationships will not interfere with Mr.&nbsp;Lowers&#146;s ability to exercise
independent judgment as a director of Bankshares.

</DIV>





<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank grants loans and letters of credit to its executive officers, directors and their
affiliated entities. These loans are made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the
same terms and conditions, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same
time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons, and, in the opinion of management, do not
involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. The
aggregate amount of such loans outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $2.3
million and $2.5&nbsp;million, respectively. During 2010, new loans and line of credit advances to such
related parties amounted to $150 thousand in the aggregate and payments amounted to $360 thousand
in the aggregate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank also maintains deposit accounts with some of its executive officers, directors and
their affiliated entities. The aggregate amount of these deposit accounts at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009 amounted to $1.1&nbsp;million and $2.1&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted above, effective January&nbsp;26, 2011, Alliance and former Executive Vice President Frank
H. Grace, III settled a lawsuit brought by Mr.&nbsp;Grace with respect to his resignation of employment

of the settlement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bankshares&#146; Code of Ethics, all directors and employees (including the executive
officers) are prohibited from having any direct or indirect financial or other participation in any
business that competes with, supplies goods or services to, or is a customer of Bankshares.
Bankshares&#146; President, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Audit Committee are the
Compliance Officers as identified in the Code of Ethics and are responsible for overseeing
compliance with the Code of Ethics. These kinds of transactions are sometimes referred to as
&#147;related person transactions.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing, approving and/or ratifying all
related person transactions, other than related person transactions with respect to routine banking
matters, which are reviewed in accordance with Regulation&nbsp;O and are not reviewed by the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee&#146;s decision whether or not to approve or ratify a related person
transaction will be made in light of the committee&#146;s determination as to whether the transaction is
or is not in the best interests of Bankshares. Where such transactions involve a director, the
committee may also take into account the effect of the transaction on the director&#146;s status as an
independent member of the Board and eligibility to serve on Board committees under SEC and Nasdaq
rules and regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &#147;related person&#148; generally means any of Bankshares&#146; directors or executive officers,
nominees for director, persons known to own 5% or more of Bankshares&#146; common stock, and any member
of the &#147;immediate family&#148; of such person.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &#147;related person transaction&#148; is generally an existing or proposed transaction in which
Bankshares was or is to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which the
related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A related person
