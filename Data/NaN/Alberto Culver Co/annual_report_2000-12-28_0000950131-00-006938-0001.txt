                                    PART I
ITEM  1. BUSINESS
-----------------
BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------

Alberto-Culver Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (herein referred to
collectively as the "company," unless indicated otherwise) have three principal
business segments.  The company's consumer products business includes two
segments, "Alberto-Culver North America" and "Alberto-Culver International," and
includes developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing branded consumer
products worldwide.  Alberto-Culver North America includes the company's
consumer products operations in the United States and Canada while Alberto-
Culver International sells consumer products in more than 120 other countries.

The classes of products in the Alberto-Culver North America and the Alberto-
Culver International business segments include health and beauty care products
as well as food and household products.  Health and beauty care products
accounted for approximately 39%, 39% and 41% of the company's consolidated net
sales for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Food
and household products accounted for approximately 5%, 6% and 6% of the
company's consolidated net sales for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.

The third segment, "Specialty distribution - Sally", consists of Sally Beauty
Company ("Sally Beauty"), a distributor of professional beauty supplies through
its Sally Beauty Supply stores and its Beauty Systems Group full-service
operations. Sales of the Specialty distribution - Sally business segment
accounted for approximately 56%, 55% and 53% of the company's consolidated net
sales for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Financial information about business segments and geographic area information is
incorporated herein by reference to the "Business Segments and Geographic Area

company's annual report to stockholders for the year ended September 30, 2000.

SPECIALTY DISTRIBUTION - SALLY
------------------------------

Sally Beauty Company operates a network of Sally Beauty Supply cash-and-carry
professional beauty supply stores and also sells professional beauty products to
hairdressers, beauticians and cosmetologists through its Beauty Systems Group
full-service distribution business. Sally Beauty Supply stores provide salon
owners, hairdressers and consumers with an extensive selection of hair care and
skin care products, cosmetics, styling appliances and other beauty items.
Sally's Beauty Systems Group distributes products in exclusive, licensed
territories in the Northeast, Midwest, Midsouth and Southeast United States and
Canada and only to the professional market through its stores and approximately
550 professional distributor sales consultants. As of September 30, 2000, Sally
Beauty had 2,325 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom,
Canada, Japan and Germany.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING
---------------------------------

Many of the company's consumer products are developed in the company's
laboratories.  New products introduced by the company are assigned product
managers who guide the products from development to the consumer.  The product
managers are responsible for the overall marketing plans for the products and
coordinate advertising, promotion and market research activities.

The company allocates a large portion of its revenues to the advertising,
promotion and market research of consumer products.  Net earnings are materially
affected by these expenditures, which are charged to income in the period
incurred. Advertising, promotion and market research expenditures were $286.4
million in 2000, $259.7 million in 1999 and $257.7 million in 1998.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

Advertising, promotion and market research expenditures relating to a new
product will ordinarily constitute a higher percentage of sales than in the case
of a well-established product. There can be no assurance that such expenditures
will result in consumer acceptance and profitability for a product.

The company regards television as the best medium for its advertising and uses
it to conduct extensive network, spot and cable television advertising
campaigns.  The company also advertises through other media such as newspapers,
magazines and radio as well as through Sally Beauty Company's direct mailings to
professional customers.

Extensive advertising and promotion are required to build and protect a
product's market position.  The company believes there is significant consumer
awareness of its major brands and that such awareness is an important factor in
the company's operating results.

COMPETITION
-----------

The domestic and international markets for the company's branded consumer
products are highly competitive and sensitive to changes in consumer preferences
and demands.  The company's competitors range in size from large, highly
diversified companies (some of which have substantially greater financial
resources than the company) to small, specialized producers.  The company
competes on the basis of product quality and price and believes that brand
loyalty and consumer acceptance are important factors.  The company's markets
are characterized by frequent introductions of competitive products and by the
entry of other manufacturers as new competitors, both of which are typically
accompanied by extensive advertising and promotional campaigns. Such campaigns
are often very costly and can significantly affect the sales and earnings of the
company and its competitors.

Sally Beauty Company experiences domestic and international competition from a
wide range of retail outlets, including mass merchandisers, drug stores and
supermarkets, carrying a full line of health and beauty products. In addition,
Sally Beauty competes with thousands of local and regional beauty supply stores
and full-service dealers selling directly to salons through both professional
distributor sales consultants and cash and carry outlets open only to salon
professionals. Sally also faces competition from certain manufacturers which use
their own sales forces to distribute their professional beauty products directly
to salons.

DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES
---------------------------------

Retail health and beauty care products and food and household products are sold
primarily through the company's sales force consisting of approximately 40
employees and 30 independent brokers calling upon wholesale drug establishments
and retail outlets such as supermarkets, drug stores, mass merchandisers and
variety stores.

Professional hair care products in the United States are sold by company sales
representatives and brokers to beauty supply outlets and to beauty distributors
who in turn sell to beauty salons, barber shops and beauty schools.

SALLY BEAUTY COMPANY DISTRIBUTION
---------------------------------

Sally Beauty Company sells professional beauty supplies through full-service
distributors and its 2,325 stores located in 47 states, Puerto Rico, the United
Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany.  Sally Beauty Supply stores are self-
service, cash-and-carry and are primarily located in strip shopping centers.
Sally operates the world's largest chain of professional beauty supply stores
and as such is a major customer of some of the company's competitors in the
personal care products industry.  Sally sells Alberto-Culver North America's
professional hair care products, but these products represent only a small
portion of Sally's selection of salon brands.

                                      -4-

FOREIGN OPERATIONS
------------------

Products of the company are sold in more than 120 countries or geographic
regions, primarily through direct sales by subsidiaries, independent
distributors and licensees.

The company's foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in transactions
involving foreign currencies and political uncertainties.

EMPLOYEES
---------

In its domestic and foreign operations, the company had approximately 15,300
full-time equivalent employees as of September 30, 2000, consisting of
approximately 9,000 hourly personnel and 6,300 salaried employees. At September
30, 1999, the company had approximately 13,400 full-time equivalent employees.
The increase in employees during fiscal year 2000 is principally due to the
expansion of Sally's Beauty Systems Group full-service operations and the growth
in the number of Sally Beauty Supply stores.

Certain subsidiaries of the company have union contracts covering production,
warehouse, shipping and maintenance personnel.  The company considers relations
with its employees to be satisfactory.

REGULATION
----------

The company is subject to the regulations of a number of federal and state
agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade
Commission.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
----------------------

The company's trademarks, certain of which are material to its business, are
registered or legally protected in the United States, Canada and other countries
throughout the world in which products of the company are sold. Although the
company owns patents and has other patent applications pending, its business is
not materially dependent upon patents or patent protection.

                         Independent Auditors' Report
                         ----------------------------


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Alberto-Culver Company:

On October 25, 2000, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of Alberto-
Culver Company and Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000 and 1999 and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders' equity
for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2000, as
contained in the 2000 annual report to stockholders. These consolidated
financial statements and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the
annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2000. In connection with our audits
of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also audited the
related financial statement schedule as listed in Item 14(a)2 of the annual
report on Form 10-K. That financial statement schedule is the responsibility of
the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on that
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
