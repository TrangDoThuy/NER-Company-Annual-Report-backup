(1) Options are non-qualified stock options and generally terminate 90 days
    following termination of the executive officer's employment with AOLA or the
    expiration date, whichever occurs earlier. The exercise price of each option
    was equal to the fair market value per share of the class A common stock on
    the

    grant date. All options vest over a four-year period at the rate of 25% per
    year with the first vesting date occurring on January 1, 2001, with the
    exception of Mr. Herington's options, which vest over a three-year period at
    the rate of 33.3% per year with the first vesting date occurring on January
    1, 2001.
(2) Amounts represent hypothetical gains that could be achieved for the
    respective options if exercised at the end of the option term. These gains
    are based on assumed rates of stock appreciation of 5% and 10% compounded
    annually from the date of the respective options were granted to their
    expiration date. The gains shown are net of the option exercise price, but
    do not include deductions for taxes or other expenses associated with the
    exercise of the option or the sale of the underlying shares. The actual
    gains, if any, on the exercise of stock options will depend on the future
    performance of the class A common stock, the option holder's continued
    employment throughout the option period, and the date on which the options
    are exercised.

AGGREGATED OPTION EXERCISES IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR AND YEAR END VALUES

     The following table summarizes for each of the named executive officers
unexercised options held at December 31, 2000. None of the named executive
officers held any stock appreciation rights or exercised any stock options or
stock appreciation rights during 2000. The value of unexercised in-the-money
options at year end is the difference between the exercise price and the fair
market value of the underlying stock on December 29, 2000, the last business day
of the twelve month period ended December 31, 2000. The closing price of our
class A common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on that date was $2.688.

(1) Actual gains, if any, on exercise will depend on the value of the class A
    common stock on the date of sale of any shares acquired upon exercise of the
    option. The named executive officers do not hold any options, exercisable or
    unexercisable, at exercise prices below the fair market value of the class A
    common stock on December 29, 2000 as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market.
    Such options are not "in the money" and their value is therefore, zero.

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

     The following table provides information regarding the ownership of our
class A common stock as of April 27, 2001 by:

        - the named executive officers listed in the summary compensation table;

        - each director;

        - all current directors and executive officers as a group; and

        - each stockholder known by us to own beneficially more than 5% of our
          class A common stock.

     For purposes of calculating the number and percentage of outstanding shares
held by each holder named below, any shares which that holder has the right to
acquire within 60 days of April 27, 2001 are considered to be outstanding, but
shares which may be similarly acquired by other holders are not considered to be
outstanding.

                                        11
<PAGE>   12

     We believe that the stockholders named in this table have the sole voting
and investment power for all shares of the class A common stock shown to be
beneficially owned by them based on information they have provided to us, with
the following exceptions:

        - The Cisneros Group's shares are owned by Aspen Investments LLC and
          Atlantis Investments LLC, companies within the Cisneros Group of
          Companies. Aspen Investments LLC is indirectly beneficially owned by a
          trust established by Gustavo A. Cisneros for the benefit of himself
          and members of his family, and Atlantis Investments LLC is indirectly
          beneficially owned by a trust established by Ricardo J. Cisneros for
          the benefit of himself and members of his family. Aspen Investments
          LLC and Gustavo A. Cisneros disclaim beneficial ownership of the
          shares of AOLA owned by Atlantis Investments LLC or Ricardo J.
          Cisneros. Atlantis Investments LLC and Ricardo J. Cisneros disclaim
          beneficial ownership of the shares of AOLA owned by Aspen Investments
          LLC or Gustavo A. Cisneros.

        - A total of 216,666 shares originally issued to the Cisneros Group
          consist of shares of series C preferred stock held by the children of
          Gustavo A. Cisneros. These shares are subject to a voting agreement
          allowing Aspen Investments LLC to vote the shares. The voting
          agreement terminates if the series C preferred shares are transferred
          by the children in the future or if the shares are converted into
          shares of our class A common stock.

        - A total of 288,888 shares originally issued to the Cisneros Group
          consist of shares of series C preferred stock held by the children of
          Ricardo J. Cisneros. These shares are subject to a voting agreement
          allowing Atlantis Investments LLC to vote the shares. The voting
          agreement terminates if the series C preferred shares are transferred
          by the children in the future or if the shares are converted into
          shares of our class A common stock.

        - AOL's shares include 240,000 shares of class A common stock issuable
          upon exercise of options held by employees of AOL or its parent, AOL
          Time Warner Inc., who are also directors of AOLA. Although such
          employees are the record holders of their respective options, AOL and
          AOL Time Warner Inc. hold or share disposition power with respect to
          all of the shares of the class A common stock underlying the options.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

2001 FINANCING

     Stock Purchase Agreement with AOL, the Cisneros Group and Banco Itau.  On
March 30, 2001, AOLA, AOL, the Cisneros Group and Banco Itau entered into a
stock purchase agreement, under which AOL purchased 4,717,374 shares of series D
preferred stock, the Cisneros Group purchased 4,536,678 shares of series E
preferred stock, and Banco Itau purchased 4,237,840 additional shares of class A
common stock, each at a price of $4.6875 per share on April 2, 2001. Under the
terms of the stock purchase agreement, AOL has agreed to purchase an additional
9,434,749 shares of series D preferred stock, and the Cisneros Group has agreed
to purchase an additional 9,073,358 shares of series E preferred stock. These
purchases will occur at closings that will take place on June 1 and August 1,
2001.

     If AOL defaults in the timely payment of the full amount owed to AOLA for
any shares to be purchased by AOL under the stock purchase agreement, the
Cisneros Group will have the right to cure such payment default by paying all or
a portion of the amount of the default and receiving a number of shares equal to
the amount of the default payment made by the Cisneros Group divided by $4.6875.
In addition, the Cisneros Group would then have the right to purchase from AOL
such aggregate number of shares of series B preferred stock, series D preferred
stock or class B common stock, as the Cisneros Group selects, up to an amount
equal to the number of shares purchased from AOLA pursuant to the share purchase
described in the preceding sentence, at a purchase price equal to $3.75. AOL has
the right to cure similar defaults by the Cisneros Group and to purchase shares
from AOLA at $4.6875 per share upon any default by the Cisneros Group, as well
as the right to purchase up to an equal aggregate amount of shares of series C
preferred stock, series E preferred stock or class C common stock from the
Cisneros Group in the event of such a default, at a purchase price of $3.75.

     Voting Agreement with AOL and the Cisneros Group.  In connection with the
stock purchase agreement, we entered into a voting agreement with AOL and the
Cisneros Group, dated as of March 30, 2001. Under the voting agreement, AOL and
the Cisneros Group also agreed to vote in favor of any additional actions
necessary to permit the automatic conversion of the shares of the series D and E
preferred stock purchased by AOL and the Cisneros Group into shares of series B
and C preferred stock, and to authorize the shares issued in the conversion (and
any shares of capital stock issuable upon conversion of those shares) to be
authorized for quotation or listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

THE REORGANIZATION

     Before August 7, 2000, the business of AOLA was conducted by affiliates of
AOL Latin America, S.L. AOL Latin America, S.L. is a limited liability company
organized in Spain in December 1998. AOL Latin America, S.L. was formed by AOL
and the Cisneros Group as a joint venture in which:

     - AOL contributed royalty-free license rights in exchange for its ownership
       interest. AOL's contribution of these rights was recorded at AOL's
       historical cost basis, which was zero; and

     - the Cisneros Group contributed an aggregate amount of approximately
       $100.1 million in exchange for its ownership interest. The Cisneros Group
       then sold at cost approximately 1.96% of its interest to Eduardo Hauser,
       Cristina Pieretti and Steven Bandel. Mr. Hauser is a named executive
       officer of AOLA, and Ms. Pieretti and Mr. Bandel are members of our
       board.

     On August 7, 2000, AOLA became the holding company of, and indirectly
acquired all of, AOL Latin America, S.L. and its affiliates through a corporate
reorganization. Under the corporate reorganization:

     - AOL exchanged its ownership interests in one of the two holding companies
       that owned AOL Latin America, S.L. and its affiliates for 101,858,334
       shares of our series B preferred stock;

                                        15
<PAGE>   16

     - The Cisneros Group exchanged its ownership interest in one of the two
       holding companies that owned AOL Latin America, S.L. and its affiliates
       for 99,861,910 shares of our series C preferred Stock;

     - Eduardo Hauser, Cristina Pieretti and Steven Bandel exchanged their
       ownership interests in one of the two holding companies that owned AOL
       Latin America S.L. for 1,996,424 shares of our series C preferred stock.
       Their shares of series C preferred stock immediately converted into
       shares of class A common stock; and

     - AOL received a warrant to purchase 16,541,250 shares in any combination
       of our series B preferred class A common or class B common stock.

     Under the corporate reorganization, AOL and the Cisneros Group agreed to
indemnify us and our affiliates, but not each other, for taxes attributable to
their ownership interests in the holding companies that owned AOL Latin America,
S.L., as well as other liabilities attributable to these holding companies,
arising before the reorganization.

STOCKHOLDERS' AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, WITH AOL AND THE CISNEROS GROUP

     On August 7, 2000 we entered into a stockholders' agreement with AOL and
the Cisneros Group, which contains various provisions that affect the way in
which we operate our business and govern many important aspects of the
relationships among AOL, the Cisneros Group and us. On March 30, 2001, this
agreement was amended in connection with the equity investment by our principal
stockholders, AOL, the Cisneros Group and Banco Itau.

     Voting Agreement.  AOL and the Cisneros Group have agreed to vote all of
their shares of capital stock, which collectively represent 97.2% of the voting
power of our outstanding capital stock, to elect the four directors nominated by
our special committee for election by the holders of all shares of our
outstanding capital stock, voting together. Under the registration rights and
stockholders agreement, as amended, with Banco Itau, AOL and the Cisneros Group
have agreed to vote their shares of capital stock in favor of an individual
nominated by Banco Itau to serve as one of these four directors.

     Non-Compete.  AOL, the Cisneros Group and any entity in which either of
them owns a 35% or greater interest may not acquire more than a 35% interest in
a competitor of AOLA. The Cisneros Group may, however, own up to a 50% interest
in RSL Communications Latin America, Ltd. ("RSL-LA") or Galaxy Latin America
LLC, regardless of whether these companies are providing competitive online
services. Any entity that provides PC-based online services in Latin America to
a substantial consumer base is considered a competitor of AOLA. After the later
of December 15, 2003 or the date on which either AOL or the Cisneros Group owns
less than 20% of our outstanding capital stock, these restrictions will no
longer apply to AOL, the Cisneros Group and their affiliates.

     Until the later of August 7, 2005 or the date on which either AOL or the
Cisneros Group owns less than 20% of our outstanding capital stock:

     - neither the Cisneros Group, nor any entity in which it owns at least a
       35% interest, may acquire more than a 35% interest in a competitor that
       provides TV- or wireless-based online services in Latin America. However,
       the Cisneros Group may own up to a 50% interest in RSL-LA or Galaxy Latin
       America LLC, regardless of whether these companies are providing
       competitive online services; and

     - AOL may not offer in Latin America any AOL-branded TV-based online
       services or any AOL-branded wireless-based online services that it
       develops for commercial launch prior to August 7, 2004.

     The 20% threshold described above will be lowered in some instances,
including:

     - if an additional principal stockholder is admitted as a stockholder of
       AOLA;

     - if we issue more shares of our capital stock; or

     - if AOL exercises the warrant it holds.

     If either AOL or the Cisneros Group breaches these non-compete provisions,
then:

                                        16
<PAGE>   17

     - if the Cisneros Group is the breaching party, we will have the option to
       purchase all of the capital stock held by the Cisneros Group at its fair
       market value, less any damages resulting from the breach, in cash or by
       delivery of a promissory note, payable over a three-year term; or

     - if we do not exercise this option, AOL will have the option to purchase
       the shares from the Cisneros Group at their fair market value, less any
       damages resulting from the breach, in cash or in freely tradable shares
       of AOL common stock in installments over a three-year period; and

     - if AOL is the breaching party where PC-based online services are
       involved, the Cisneros Group will have the option to require AOL to
       purchase the Cisneros Group's shares at their fair market value, plus any
       damage resulting from the breach, in cash or in freely tradable shares of
       AOL common stock, in installments over a three-year period.

     Banco Itau has the right to enforce these non-compete provisions as long as
it owns at least 6% of our outstanding shares of capital stock calculated on a
fully diluted basis and can only enforce the non-compete so long AOL or the
Cisneros Group own at least 20% of our outstanding capital stock.

     Restrictions on Transfer.  Neither AOL nor the Cisneros Group may transfer
their shares of capital stock except:

     - to their wholly-owned affiliates or to each other;

     - through the sale of their businesses;

     - through the admission of another principal stockholder as described in
       the admission of additional principal stockholder paragraph, below;

     - up to 20% of their shares may be transferred to their employees or to the
       employees of their wholly owned affiliates and, in the case of the
       Cisneros Group, to designated Cisneros family members. Unless the
       transferred shares are converted into class A common stock, AOL or the
       Cisneros Group will retain the voting rights to those shares;

     - shares of class A common stock purchased in our initial public offering
       or that are issuable upon conversion of shares of B stock or C stock can
       be sold in a registered offering or under Rule 144 of the Securities Act
       of 1933, as amended; and

     - to another party, other than to a competitor, provided that they first
       offer their shares on the same terms to the other stockholder.

     Any transfer of capital stock will subject the person acquiring the shares
to the provisions of the stockholders' agreement.

     Admission of Additional Principal Stockholders.  AOL and the Cisneros Group
may admit one or more additional principal stockholders of AOLA. Any additional
stockholder would either receive new shares of our capital stock or would
acquire shares owned by AOL or the Cisneros Group. If the new stockholder is a
strategic stockholder, the Cisneros Group's ownership interest in AOLA will be
reduced at a disproportionately greater rate than AOL's ownership interest in
AOLA. To achieve the reduction, for example, either AOL or we would purchase
shares held by the Cisneros Group at their fair market value.

     Standstill Provisions.  Until December 15, 2003, neither AOL nor the
Cisneros Group may acquire any additional shares of our capital stock except:

     - shares in an amount equal to 5% of the sum of our outstanding shares of
       capital stock on March 30, 2001;

     - shares issuable to AOL upon the exercise of the warrant it holds;

     - shares of capital stock that we issue to them as payment for an asset or
       right sold to us;

     - shares of capital stock acquired in a tender or exchange offer for all of
our securities;

     - as approved by the party not acquiring the shares and the disinterested
members of our board; and

                                        17
<PAGE>   18

     - shares issued to them by Banco Itau pursuant to their exercise of a right
of first refusal.

     Commitments made by the Cisneros Group.  The Cisneros Group has agreed to
provide us with advertising, promotional and online content services. From the
beginning of our operations through December 31, 2000, we incurred $891,000 for
services, including personnel services and travel costs, provided by the
Cisneros Group. Some of these services were provided and will be provided in the
future at varying charges depending upon the type of service.

     Indemnification provision.  Our stockholders' agreement contains provisions
requiring us to indemnify AOL and the Cisneros Group for liabilities imposed
upon them for breach of fiduciary duty based upon their appropriation of our
business opportunities. These provisions, along with provisions in our license
and services agreements requiring us to indemnify AOL, are substantially similar
to those contained in our certificate of incorporation.

     Term and Termination.  The stockholders' agreement will terminate:

     - when AOL and the Cisneros Group no longer hold any shares of our capital
       stock;

     - when the parties mutually terminate the stockholders' agreement; or

     - June 30, 2048, whichever occurs first.

     Either AOL or the Cisneros Group may terminate the stockholders' agreement
if the other stockholder no longer holds at least 10% of our outstanding capital
stock.

THE AOL WARRANT

     On August 7, 2000, we issued a warrant to AOL to purchase 16,541,250 shares
in any combination of our series B preferred, class A common or class B common
stock at a per share exercise price equal to the initial public offering price
of $8.00. The warrant is immediately exercisable and has a ten-year term. The
number of shares issuable under the warrant may be increased if we, AOL or the
Cisneros Group issue or transfer shares to one or more additional strategic
stockholders. The warrant allows AOL to pay the exercise price due under the
warrant by tendering to us a portion of the shares subject to the warrant
instead of paying the exercise price in cash.

THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, WITH AOL AND THE CISNEROS GROUP

     On March 30, 2001, we amended our existing agreement with AOL and the
Cisneros Group to provide them with their respective registration rights for the
shares of class A common stock issuable upon conversion of their B stock, C
stock, and series D and E preferred stock, and in the case of AOL, upon the
exercise of the warrant it holds to purchase 16,541,250.

THE VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY

     On August 7, 2000, the Cisneros Group transferred a total of 505,554 shares
of series C preferred stock to children of Gustavo A. Cisneros and Ricardo J.
Cisneros. We have entered into a voting agreement and irrevocable proxy with the
Cisneros Group and these transferees under which these transferees appointed
Aspen Investments LLC, in the case of shares held by the children of Gustavo A.
Cisneros, and Atlantis Investments LLC in the case of shares held by the
children of Ricardo J. Cisneros, as their respective representatives to vote his
or her shares. The voting agreement terminates only with respect to shares
transferred by a transferee in the future or if these shares of series C
preferred stock are converted into shares of our class A common stock.

THE AOL LICENSE AGREEMENT

Our License

     Under our license agreement with AOL, dated August 7, 2000, we have:

     - a royalty free, exclusive license to offer AOL-branded PC-based online
       services in Latin America;

     - the exclusive right to offer AOL-branded TV-based online services in
       Latin America;

     - the exclusive right to offer in Latin America any AOL-branded
       wireless-based online services developed by AOL for commercial launch on
       or before August 7, 2004; and

     - a non-exclusive license to offer a localized network of AOL-branded
       portals in Latin America, with an option to license exclusively any
       Spanish- or Portuguese-language AOL-branded portals that AOL may develop
       for the Latin American market, subject to our payment of a license fee.

     We also have the rights to use all related AOL proprietary software and
technology as well as AOL-registered domain names and principal trademarks in
Latin America.

     We have interconnected our America Online Brazil, America Online Mexico,
America Online Argentina country services and regional portal to the services
provided by AOL and its international affiliates. This interconnection provides
our members with access to the AOL services and AOL international interactive
services and permits AOL members worldwide to access the AOLA country services.
AOL is obligated to license to us, or to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain for us, the license rights it has in third-party software products used
in operating the AOL-branded interactive services. These third-party licenses
may be royalty-free or may require payments by us.

     From December 15, 1998 through December 31, 2000, we did not make any
payments to AOL for services received under the license agreement. We believe
that annual payments for these services will not exceed $60,000 in the future.

     We have the same rights to offer CompuServe-branded services. We only have
the right to offer AOL-and CompuServe-branded interactive services. We also have
a non-exclusive right to market and promote AOL's ICQ service in Latin America.
We do not have the right to offer Netscape, Digital City, MovieFone or any other
non-AOL-branded interactive service.

Termination of our exclusive rights

     We will lose the exclusivity of our licensed rights:

        - to AOL-branded PC-based online services, upon the later of December
          15, 2003 or the date on which either AOL or the Cisneros Group owns
          20% or less of the outstanding voting stock of AOLA; and

        - to AOL-branded TV-based and wireless-based online services, upon the
          later of August 7, 2005 or the date on which either AOL or the
          Cisneros Group owns 20% or less of the outstanding voting stock of
          AOLA.

     These 20% thresholds will be lowered if:

        - an additional strategic stockholder is admitted as a stockholder of
          AOLA;

        - we issue more shares of our capital stock; or

        - AOL exercises the warrant it holds to purchase 16,541,250 shares of
          class A common stock.

     AOL may terminate our rights under the license if we materially breach its
terms.

THE AOL SERVICES AGREEMENT

     We entered into a services agreement with AOL on August 7, 2000, under
which AOL provides various services to us, including:

     - localization of AOL software and software updates;

     - development and installation services, including requested modifications,
       enhancements and revisions to AOL's software;

     - host computer services;

     - network connections from our services to the AOL servers;

     - technical support;

     - training in areas such as marketing, business development, member
       support, public relations, finance and accounting;

     - support and maintenance for third-party software licensed to us by AOL;
       and

     - joint venture assistance.

     We have agreed to compensate AOL for these services at rates at least as
favorable to us as those charged by AOL to any other party, including joint
venture affiliates, but excluding affiliates that are at least 75% owned by AOL.
Based on our management's experience negotiating similar contracts, as well as
its knowledge of our competitors' cost structures, we believe that the terms of
the services agreement are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated third party.

     We have agreed to interconnect our America Online Brazil, America Online
Mexico and America Online Argentina country services and all future AOLA country
services to the services provided by AOL and its international affiliates. This
interconnection, which will be provided free of charge, will provide our members
with access to the AOL service and AOL International interactive services and
will permit AOL members worldwide to access the AOLA country services.

     For the 2000 fiscal year, we had incurred expenses totaling approximately
$11.2 million payable to AOL under our services agreement. We anticipate that
payments to AOL for these services will exceed $60,000 annually in the future,
but we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of the payments.

THE ICQ PROMOTION AGREEMENT

     We have entered into an agreement with AOL under which we have the right in
Latin America to promote AOL's ICQ service. As local versions of the ICQ service
are developed, we may engage in other marketing and cross-promotion activities
with AOL.

THE LETTER AGREEMENT REGARDING PUERTO RICO SUBSCRIBERS

     We entered into a letter agreement with AOL under which AOL transferred to
us the net economic benefit associated with subscribers to the service in Puerto
Rico, and these subscribers count toward our member totals. We anticipate that
payments to AOL for services provided under the letter agreement will exceed
$60,000, annually.

THE INTERACTIVE SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH AOL

     We entered into an interactive services agreement with AOL under which we
have created a mini-channel for AOL that will be the exclusive aggregator of
content of interest to Latinos living in the United States on the US version of
the AOL service, the aol.com website and Netscape, and which may also be
distributed on Digital City and CompuServe.

                                        20
<PAGE>   21

     We will share with AOL advertising and commerce revenues relating to this
mini-channel. We anticipate that the amounts involved will exceed $60,000
annually in the future, but we are unable to estimate at this time these
amounts.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH OFFICERS OF AOL TIME WARNER INC. AND AOL

     Two members of our board appointed by AOL are also executive officers of
AOL Time Warner Inc., and two members of our board are also directors of AOL
Time Warner Inc. Two members of our board appointed by AOL are also executive
officers of AOL.

     - Robert W. Pittman is the co-chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner
       Inc. and a director of AOL Time Warner Inc.;

     - J. Michael Kelly is the chief financial officer of AOL Time Warner Inc.;

     - Michael Lynton is the president of AOL International;

     - Gerald Sokol, Jr. is the senior vice president and general manager of AOL
       International; and

     - Miles R. Gilburne is a director of AOL Time Warner Inc.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH OFFICERS OF THE CISNEROS GROUP

     Four of the five members of our board appointed by the Cisneros Group are
also executive officers and directors of companies within the Cisneros Group.

     - Gustavo A. Cisneros oversees the management and operations of the
       Cisneros Group and is an executive officer and director of many of its
       constituent companies;

     - Ricardo J. Cisneros is an executive officer and director of many of the
       constituent companies of the Cisneros Group;

     - Steven I. Bandel holds several senior management positions in companies
       in the Cisneros Group and has the title of president and chief operating
       officer of the Cisneros Group; and

     - Cristina Pieretti holds a number of senior management positions in
       companies in the Cisneros Group and has the title of vice president of
       operations of the Cisneros Group.

OUR PURCHASE OF AOL'S LATIN AMERICAN COMPUSERVE CLASSIC SUBSCRIBERS

     In December 1998, we acquired AOL's Latin American CompuServe Classic
subscribers. The cost to acquire these subscribers was determined using a
formula that was based on the expected number of Latin American CompuServe
subscribers at December 15, 1999. Because the number of subscribers at December
15, 1999 was lower than expected, AOL repaid $879,000 to us during March 2000.

THE STRATEGIC INTERACTIVE SERVICES AND MARKETING AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, WITH
BANCO ITAU

     We have entered into a ten-year strategic alliance with Banco Itau, one of
the largest banks in Latin America, which provides limited online financial
services to approximately one million of its approximately seven million banking
customers. We have created a co-branded, customized version of our America
Online Brazil service that Banco Itau markets to its customers. Banco Itau
customers that register for the co-branded service and receive approval from the
bank will be considered subscribers of the co-branded service.

     We are currently negotiating a proposed amendment to our strategic
marketing agreement with Banco Itau, which material proposed terms are described
below. Although the proposed amendment has not been formally memoralized, and
some of the following terms are still subject to change, we and Banco Itau are
operating under these terms:

                                        21
<PAGE>   22

     Unlimited access accounts for select Banco Itau customers and
employees.  Until October 31, 2001, Banco Itau will offer unlimited access to
the co-branded service as follows:

     - participating Banco Itau customers and Banco Itau employees will receive
       unlimited monthly access to the co-branded service. Banco Itau will pay
       us a fixed monthly fee for each bank employee that has an unlimited
       access account with the co-branded service. Banco Itau will pay us the
       lesser of the fee for actual usage or a fixed monthly fee for each bank
       customer that has an unlimited access account with the co-branded
       service.

THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AND STOCKHOLDERS' AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, WITH BANCO ITAU

     On August 11, 2000, we entered into a registration rights and stockholders'
agreement with Banco Itau. This agreement was subsequently amended on March 30,
2001 in connection with the equity investment by AOL, the Cisneros Group and
Banco Itau. The agreement limits Banco Itau's ability to compete with us, gives
Banco Itau representation rights on our board and governs many aspects of Banco
Itau's ability to sell its shares of class A common stock.

     Non-Compete.  Banco Itau and any entity in which Banco Itau owns a 35% or
greater interest may not acquire more than a 35% interest in one of our
competitors. Any entity that provides PC-based online services in Latin America
to a substantial consumer base is considered a competitor of AOLA. These
restrictions will no longer apply to Banco Itau and its affiliates after the
later of December 15, 2003 or the date on which Banco Itau owns less than 6% of
our outstanding capital stock.

     Until the later of August 7, 2005 or the date on which Banco Itau owns less
than 6% of our outstanding capital stock, neither Banco Itau, nor any entity in
which it owns at least a 35% interest, may acquire more than a 35% interest in a
competitor that provides TV- or wireless-based online services in Latin America.

     If Banco Itau breaches these non-compete provisions, then:

     - we will have the option to purchase all of the capital stock held by
       Banco Itau at its fair market value, less any damages resulting from the
       breach, in cash or by delivery of a promissory note, payable over a
       three-year term; or

     - if we do not exercise this option, AOL will have the option to purchase
       the shares from Banco Itau at their fair market value, less any damages
       resulting from the breach, in cash or in freely tradable shares of AOL
       common stock in installments over a three-year period.

     Banco Itau has the right to enforce the provisions of our stockholders'
agreement with AOL and the Cisneros Group that limit AOL's and the Cisneros
Group's ability to compete with us. Banco Itau's right to enforce the
non-compete will continue until the earlier of the date that our strategic
interactive services and marketing agreement with Banco Itau is terminated, the
date on which Banco Itau owns less than 6% of our outstanding capital stock, and
August 2010.

     Board Representation.  Banco Itau is entitled to nominate one of our 14
directors, and AOL and the Cisneros Group have agreed to vote their shares of
capital stock in favor of the election of Banco Itau's nominee. This right to
representation on our board will continue for two years after the date of the
agreement and then for as long as Banco Itau holds at least 41% of its
31,700,000 shares of class A common stock issued on August 11, 2000 (the
"Initial Shares"), and the strategic interactive services and marketing
agreement remains in effect.

     Lock-Up.  Banco Itau has agreed not to dispose of or hedge (other than
certain repurchase transactions) any of the Initial Shares except that Banco
Itau may sell specified portions of the Initial Shares from and after agreed
upon release dates.

                                        22
<PAGE>   23

     The table below shows the percentage of the Initial Shares that will remain
subject to the lock-up on each release date:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                                  LOCKED-UP
RELEASE DATE                                    INITIAL SHARES
------------                                   ----------------
<S>                                            <C>
December 10, 2001............................       83.33%
December 10, 2002............................       41.67%
December 10, 2003............................       25.00%
December 10, 2004............................        8.33%
December 10, 2005............................        0.00%
</TABLE>

     The lock-up will terminate if there is a change of control of AOLA, if
Banco Itau validly terminates the strategic interactive services and marketing
agreement or if AOLA terminates the strategic interactive services and marketing
agreement after December 10, 2003.

     Banco Itau has also agreed that in a single day it will not dispose of
shares of any of its class A common stock including the Initial Shares and the
shares purchased under the March 30, 2001 stock purchase agreement on the Nasdaq
National Market, or any other market on which the class A common stock is
listed, if the disposition will exceed 10% of the average trading volume during
the prior 20 trading days. This 10% restriction does not apply to sales by Banco
Itau:

     - in underwritten offerings;

     - in single block trades if Banco Itau receives a price in all such trades
       that is at least equal to 95% of the prior day's closing price, provided
       that if Banco Itau receives less than 100% of the prior day's closing
       price, Banco Itau may only complete one series of trades that exceed the
       10% restriction every ten trading days; and

     - in a series of trades in a single day if Banco Itau receives a price in
       all such trades that is at least equal to 95% of the prior day's closing
       price, provided that if Banco Itau receives less than 100% of the prior
       day's closing price, Banco Itau may only complete one series of trades
       that exceed the 10% restriction every ten trading days.

     Further, Banco Itau has agreed that through March 30, 2003 it will comply
with the volume limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act for all shares
sold on the Nasdaq National Market. After March 30, 2003, during any 90-day
period it will not sell on the Nasdaq National Market more than the greater of
1% of the number of shares of class A common stock outstanding, calculated on an
as converted basis, as of the start of such 90-day period and the number of
shares of capital stock that may be sold under the volume limitations of Rule
144.

     Repurchase Agreements.  Itau Bank has informed us that it has entered into
derivative securities transactions with investment banks and/or banking
institutions and may enter into similar derivative securities transactions in
the future. As part of these arrangements, Itau Bank purchased call options from
certain investment banks to repurchase shares of class A common stock and issued
put options to these investment banks to require Itau Bank to repurchase shares
of class A common stock held by it in repurchase or similar transactions, and
may continue to arrange repurchase or similar transactions during the period in
which it holds shares of class A common stock. Banco Itau has agreed to maintain
sole voting control over the shares and that it will take back the shares upon
the expiration of any of these transactions. Banco Itau does retain the risk of
loss on the shares. Although our lock-up agreement with Banco Itau will not
apply to these repurchase agreements, subsequent sales will remain subject to
other restrictions under the amended and restated registration rights agreement
and subsequent sales with respect to the Initial Shares will remain subject to
the subscription agreement and lock-up. Banco Itau has also agreed that all of
the repurchase transactions involving the Initial Shares will comply with
Regulation S under the Securities Act.

     Registration Rights.  We have agreed to provide Banco Itau with
registration rights for the shares of class A common stock that it owns that are
not locked up.

                                        23
<PAGE>   24

     Tag Along Right.  Banco Itau has the right to participate on the same terms
in sales or transfers by either or both of AOL and the Cisneros Group of shares
of class A common stock or securities that are convertible into class A common
stock. For this tag along right to be triggered, either or both of AOL and the
Cisneros Group must sell or transfer in a 12-month period more than 15% of their
shares of class A common stock held as of August 11, 2000, calculated on an as
converted basis. Banco Itau is entitled to sell the same percentage of shares as
whichever of AOL and the Cisneros Group is selling, or, if both are selling, the
same percentage as whichever of AOL and the Cisneros Group has sold the greatest
percentage. Banco Itau may only sell shares that are not locked up. This tag
along right does not apply to sales by the Cisneros Group to AOL, or if AOL or
the Cisneros Group sells or transfers securities:

     - to their 75%-owned affiliates;

     - in a public offering;

     - in a financing transaction in which they retain the right to vote their
       shares; or

     - by gift.

     Banco Itau's tag along right will terminate if the strategic interactive
services and marketing agreement is terminated for any reason other than a
breach of the agreement by us, or Banco Itau holds less than approximately 21%
of the Initial Shares.

     Right of First Refusal.  Banco Itau has a right of first refusal for any
convertible debt or equity security we intend to offer, except if we offer
convertible debt or equity securities for non-cash consideration. The amount
Banco Itau is entitled to purchase is equal to the number of shares of class A
common stock then held by Banco Itau divided by the total outstanding shares of
class A common stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis.

     Based on our management's experience negotiating similar arrangements to
our strategic alliance with Banco Itau, as well as our management's knowledge of
our competitors' cost structures, we believe that the terms of strategic
interactive services and marketing agreement are at least as favorable as we
could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party.
