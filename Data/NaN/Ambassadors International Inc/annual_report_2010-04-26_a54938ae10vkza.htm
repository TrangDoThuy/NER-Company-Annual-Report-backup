On March&nbsp;24, 2009, Arthur Rodney was appointed our interim chief executive officer. In 2009, Mr.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;2, 2006, we entered into an employment agreement with Joseph J. Ueberroth, who was
then our chairman, president and chief executive officer, which provides Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth with certain
severance and other benefits upon a termination of his employment by us without cause (as defined
below) or by Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth with or without good reason (as defined below) or upon a change of
control of us (as defined below), his death or permanent disability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employment agreement provided that, in the event of termination of Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth&#146;s
employment by us without cause or by Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth with good reason, we were to pay Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth
the sum of (i)&nbsp;an amount equal to the projected cost of Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth&#146;s medical insurance under
COBRA for the eighteen month period immediately following the termination, and (ii)&nbsp;an amount equal
to two times the average annual base salary plus the average annual bonus paid to Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth for
the two full fiscal years immediately preceding termination (the value of annual bonuses includes,
in addition to cash amounts, the values ascribed to option and share grants for financial
accounting purposes on the dates of grants). In addition to these severance amounts, all unvested
stock options and stock grants held by Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth were to immediately vest as of the date of
termination. Subject to the terms and conditions of the employment agreement, in the event of
termination of Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth&#146;s employment by Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth without good reason and upon at least
twelve months notice, the employment agreement required





us to pay Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth the sum of (i)&nbsp;an amount equal to the projected cost of Mr.
Ueberroth&#146;s medical insurance under COBRA for the eighteen month period immediately following the
termination, and (ii)&nbsp;an amount equal to one times the average annual base salary plus the average
annual bonus paid to Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth for the two full fiscal years immediately preceding termination.
In the event of a termination of Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth&#146;s employment by us due to death or disability, all
of Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth&#146;s unvested stock options and stock grants were to fully vest on such date. In
addition, in the event of a change of control, all of Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth&#146;s unvested stock options and
stock grants were to fully vest.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;15, 2008, Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth notified us that he elected to forego approximately $3
million in cash compensation due in September&nbsp;2009, pursuant to section 4 of his employment
agreement, and his 2008 long term compensation in common shares of the company valued at $750,000
that was due pursuant to Section&nbsp;3 of his employment agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;27, 2009, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Detillion that provides
for severance equal to four months base salary upon termination for any reason other than an
illegal act. As the employment agreement does not provide a term of employment, Mr.&nbsp;Detillion is
an at-will employee. Mr.&nbsp;Rodney and Ms.&nbsp;Smolkowski are not parties to employment agreements with
the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;20, 2009, Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth resigned as our president, chief executive officer and

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;1, 2009, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ambassadors Marine Group, LLC
(&#147;AMG&#148;), entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;) with
Bellwether Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Buyer&#148;), which is an affiliate of
Mr.&nbsp;Ueberroth, our former president, chief executive officer and director. Pursuant to the terms
of the Purchase Agreement, the Buyer acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership
interests of AMG from the Company for a purchase price equal to $5,000,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Equity-Based Compensation Plans</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted its 1995 Equity Participation Plan (the &#147;1995 Plan&#148;) during 1995 and
amended and restated the 1995 Plan in 1998, 1999 and 2002. In 2005, the Company adopted its 2005
Incentive Award Plan (the &#147;2005 Plan&#148;) and amended and restated the 2005 Plan in 2007. Both the
1995 Plan and the 2005 Plan provide for the grant of stock options, awards of restricted stock,
performance or other awards or stock appreciation rights to directors, employees and consultants of
the Company. The maximum number of shares which may be awarded under the 1995 Plan is 2,200,000
shares. The maximum number of shares which may be awarded under the 2005 Plan is 1,200,000 shares.
Under the terms of both the 1995 Plan and the 2005 Plan, options to purchase shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock are granted at a price set by the Compensation Committee of the board of
directors, not to be less than the par value of a share of common stock and if granted as
performance-based compensation or as incentive stock options, or
under the 2005 Plan, no less than the fair market value of
the stock on the date of grant. The Compensation Committee establishes the vesting period of the
awards. Vested options may be exercised for a period up to ten years from the grant date, as long
as option holders remain employed by the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the named executive officers have received equity based compensation awards under
either the 1995 Plan or the 2005 Plan.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our compensation program for non-employee directors is designed to align the directors&#146;
interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders and to fairly compensate our directors
for the work that is required. Each of our non-employee directors receives an annual retainer,
which amount is determined each year by our board of directors. We do not pay additional cash
compensation to our directors for their services on committees of the board or for attendance at
meetings of the board of directors or any committees upon with they sit. However, we reimburse all
directors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at board and
committee meetings. We also periodically award restricted stock or options to purchase our common
stock to our directors.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under SEC rules, we are required to disclose material transactions with us in which &#147;related
persons&#148; have a direct or indirect material interest. Related persons include any director,
nominee for director, or executive officer of us, a 5% or greater stockholder and any immediate
family members of such persons. The term &#147;transaction&#148; is broadly defined under SEC rules to
include any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship, including any indebtedness
transaction or guarantee of indebtedness.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our board of directors has adopted a written policy that requires the Audit Committee to
review and approve any related party transactions. At each calendar year&#146;s first regularly
scheduled meeting of our board of directors on an annual basis, management is required to present
to the Audit Committee specific information with respect to any such transaction expected to be
entered into or continued during that calendar year. After reviewing this information, the Audit
Committee will approve such transaction only if the following two conditions are met: (1)&nbsp;the
transaction must be in the best interests (or not inconsistent with the best interests) of us and
our stockholders; and (2)&nbsp;the transaction must be entered into by us on terms that are comparable
to those that would be obtained in an arm&#146;s length transaction with an unrelated third party. If

required to present such transactions to the Audit Committee, or any special committee delegated to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;23, 2010, we established a term loan and revolving credit facility for working
capital purposes (the &#147;Credit Facility&#148;), the terms of which are governed by a Credit and Guaranty
Agreement (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;), by and among the Company, our subsidiaries (as borrowers and/or
guarantors), Whippoorwill Associates, Inc. (and/or certain funds and accounts managed by it)
(&#147;Whippoorwill&#148;), as lenders, and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as administrative agent
and as collateral agent. The Credit Facility provides for a $5&nbsp;million revolving credit facility
and for a $10&nbsp;million term loan to be drawn in two tranches, all of which is to be used to fund
dry-dock costs for two Windstar vessels as well as working capital and other corporate purposes of
the Company and its subsidiaries. On March&nbsp;23, 2010, the first tranche of the term loan, in the
amount of $7.5&nbsp;million, was funded. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of
12&nbsp;percent per annum, are secured (on a first priority basis) by substantially all the assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries, and mature on January&nbsp;2, 2012. The Credit Facility provides for
payment of a 4% annual facility fee to the lenders and customary agent fees.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Market, a director qualifies as &#147;independent&#148;
only if our board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has no material
relationship with us (either directly, or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization
that has a relationship with us). In November&nbsp;2009 and February&nbsp;2010, upon the appointment of our
new members to the board of directors, the board of directors reviewed the independence of its
members. During these reviews, our board of directors considered transactions and relationships
between each director or any member of his or her immediate family and us and our subsidiaries and
affiliates, including those reported under &#147;Election of Directors &#151; Director Biographical
Information&#148; above. In making independence determinations, our board of directors considered each
relationship not only from the standpoint of the director, but also from the standpoint of persons
and organizations with which the director has a relationship. The purpose of these reviews is to
determine whether any such relationships or transactions would interfere with the director&#146;s
independent judgment, and therefore be inconsistent with a determination that the director is
independent.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of its review, our board of directors has affirmatively determined that  all of the continuing directors, except for Arthur Rodney, are
independent. As of April&nbsp;14, 2009, Arthur Rodney ceased to be an independent director because he
was appointed to serve as our interim chief executive officer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our independent directors regularly meet in executive sessions. In 2009, the independent
directors met nine times in executive session. At each executive session, our board of directors
elects one director to lead the session.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2009, the Audit Committee of our board of directors approved policies and
procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services to be provided by our
independent auditor and for the prohibition of certain services from being provided by the
independent auditor. We may not engage our independent auditor to render any audit or non-audit
service unless the service is approved in advance by the Audit Committee or the engagement to
render the service is entered into pursuant to the Audit Committee&#146;s pre-approval policies and
procedures. On an annual basis, the Audit Committee may pre-approve services that are expected to
be provided to us by the independent auditor during the fiscal year. At the time such pre-approval
is granted, the Audit Committee specifies the pre-approved services and establishes a monetary
limit with respect to each particular pre-approved service, which limit may not be exceeded without
obtaining further pre-approval under the policy. For any pre-approval, the Audit Committee
considers whether such services are consistent with the rules of the SEC on auditor independence.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the cost of any service exceeds the pre-approved monetary limit, such service must be
approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has delegated authority to the chairman of
the Audit Committee to pre-approve any audit or non-audit services to be provided to us by the
independent auditor. The chairman must report any pre-approval pursuant to the delegation of
authority to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All services provided by our independent auditor in 2009 were pre-approved in accordance with
the Audit Committee&#146;s pre-approval policies and procedures.
