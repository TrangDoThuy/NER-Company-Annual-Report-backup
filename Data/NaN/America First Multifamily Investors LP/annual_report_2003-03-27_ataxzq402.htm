<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. (the &quot;Partnership&quot;) was formed on April 2, 1998 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential properties.  Interest payable on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.  As a result, most of the income earned by the Partnership is exempt from federal income taxes.  Each of the revenue bonds currently held by the Partnership also provide for the payment of contingent tax-exempt interest out of excess cash flow or sale proceeds of the underlying multifamily property.  As a result, these revenue bonds provide the Partnership with the potential to participate in future increases in the cash flow generated by the financed properties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership may also invest in other types of tax-exempt securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.  These tax-exempt securities must be rated in one of the highest four rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.  The Partnership may also acquire a taxable mortgage loan secured by a multifamily property which collateralizes tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the same property.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership's business objectives are to: (i) preserve and protect its capital; (ii) provide regular cash distributions to investors; and, (iii) provide a potential for an enhanced federally tax-exempt yield as a result of a participation interest in the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the real estate financed by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B> Revenue Bonds
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At December 31, 2002, the Partnership owned nine tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds with a carrying value (at estimated fair value) of $118,528,538.
  The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were issued by various state and local
  housing authorities to provide for permanent financing of nine multifamily housing
  properties. These properties contain a total of 2,394 rental units and are located
  in Florida, Indiana, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Iowa.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the terms of the revenue bonds, the principal amounts of seven of the bonds do not amortize over their terms.  The revenue bonds provide for the payment of fixed-rate base interest to the Partnership and for the payment of contingent interest based upon net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real estate properties.  The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership from its investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is a function of the net rental revenues generated by the properties collateralizing the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.  Net rental revenues from a multifamily apartment complex depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.  Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.  This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.  In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Therefore, the return to the Partnership depends upon the economic performance of the real estate which collateralizes the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.  For this reason, the Partnership's investments are dependent on the economic performance of such real estate and may be considered to be in competition with other income-producing real estate of the same type in the same geographic areas.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Business Strategy</b></P>

The Partnership is pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt
mortgage revenue bonds in order to: (i) increase the amount of tax-exempt interest
available for distribution to its investors, (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification;
and (iii) achieve economies of scale. The Partnership may finance the acquisition
of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through the reinvestment of cash
flow, the issuance of additional Beneficial Unit Certificates &quot;BUCs&quot;
and through securitization financing arising from its existing portfolio of tax-exempt
mortgage revenue bonds. The Partnership's operating policy is to use securitizations
or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and
60% of the total market value of its assets.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2>
</font>To date, the Partnership has financed acquisitions of additional revenue bonds through a securitization transaction offered through the Merrill Lynch proprietary residual interest tax-exempt securities &quot;RITES&quot; and puttable floating option tax-exempt receipts &quot;P-Float" program.  In a securitization transaction, the Partnership deposits a revenue bond into a trust which issues two types of securities, senior securities (P-Floats) and residual interest securities (RITES).  The P-Floats are floating rate securities representing a beneficial ownership interest in the outstanding principal and interest of the revenue bonds credit enhanced by Merrill Lynch (or a Merrill Lynch affiliate) and sold to institutional investors.  The Partnership receives the net proceeds from the sale of the P-Floats and may use these funds to make additional investments.  The RITES are also retained by the Partnership and represent a beneficial ownership interest in the remaining interest on the underlying revenue bond.  The Partnership maintains a call right on the senior P-Float securities and this allows it to collapse the trusts and retain a level of control over the underlying revenue bond.  The call price of a P-Float is equal to its par amount plus 10% of any increase in the market value of the underlying revenue bond.  These transactions are accounted for as financing transactions, and, in effect, provide the Partnership with variable-rate financing.  Accordingly, these senior certificates are recorded as debt financing, the revenue bonds as investment securities held in trust, and the RITES as investment securities.  The cost of funds relating to the P-Floats/RITES<SUP> </SUP>program (calculated as interest expense as a percentage of the weighted average face amount of the P-Floats) was approximately 2.30% for the year ended December 31, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Competition</b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2><BR>
</font>The Partnership, from time to time, may be in competition with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships and other entities with objectives similar to the Partnership and such competition could reduce the availability of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for acquisition and the number of investors interested in owning BUCs.  Although the Partnership operates in a competitive environment, there are few competitors which provide the same objectives and strategy.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the Partnership's return on its tax-exempt mortgage
  revenue bonds depends on the economic performance of the multifamily apartment
  properties financed by these bonds, the Partnership may be considered to be
  in competition with other residential real estate in the same geographic areas.
  In each city in which the properties collateralized by the tax-exempt mortgage
  revenue bonds owned by the Partnership are located, such properties compete
  with a substantial number of other apartment complexes. Apartment complexes
  also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential
  tenants. The principal method of competition is to offer competitive rental
  rates. Such properties also compete by emphasizing property location, condition
  and amenities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Environmental Matters</b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership believes that each of the properties collateralizing
  its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is in compliance in all material respects
  with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other
  environmental matters. The Partnership is not aware of any environmental contamination
  at any of such properties that would require any material capital expenditure
  by the Partnership for the remediation thereof. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Segment Information</b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership is engaged in the business of acquiring, holding,
  operating, selling and otherwise dealing with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds
  and related investments. Accordingly, the Partnership has one business segment.
  Refer to the financial statements filed in response to item 8 hereof.</P>
<P><B>Risk Factors</b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The financial condition and results of the Partnership's operations
  are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond the control of the
  Partnership. </P>

<UL>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The receipt of interest and principal payments on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds will be affected by the economic results of the underlying apartment complexes.</LI><p></P></b></UL><DIR>
<DIR>
<B>

</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are issued by state or local housing authorities, they are not obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority.  Instead, each of these revenue bonds is backed by a nonrecourse loan made to the owner of the underlying apartment complex and is secured by a first mortgage lien on the property.  Because of the nonrecourse nature of the underlying mortgage loans, the sole source of cash to pay base and contingent interest on the revenue bond, and to ultimately pay the principal amount of the bond, is the net cash flow generated by the operation of the financed property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property.  This makes the Partnership's investments in these mortgage revenue bonds subject to the kinds of risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate.  If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay its debt service obligations on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on the property, a default may occur.  Net rental revenues and net sale proceeds from a particular property are applied only to debt service payments of the particular mortgage revenue bond secured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.  In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future profitability.  Therefore, the amount of base and contingent interest that the Partnership earns on its mortgage revenue bonds, and whether or not it will receive the entire principal balance of the bonds as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic results of the underlying apartment complexes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The net rental revenue from the operation of a property may be affected by many things, such as the number of tenants, the rental rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other apartment complexes, mortgage rates for single-family housing and general and local economic conditions.  In most of the markets in which these properties are located there is significant competition from other apartment complexes and from single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.  Low mortgage interest rates make single-family housing more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event of a default on a mortgage revenue bond (or a taxable loan on the same property), the Partnership will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing the property.  If the Partnership takes ownership of the property securing a defaulted revenue bond or taxable loan, it will be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property.  However, such amounts will no longer represent tax-exempt interest to the Partnership.</P></DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The value of the properties is the only source of repayment of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds</LI><p></P></b></UL><DIR>
<DIR>
<B>

</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal of most of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds does not fully amortize over their terms.  This means that all or some of the balance of the mortgage loans underlying these bonds will be repaid as a lump-sum &quot;balloon&quot; payment at the end of the term.  The ability of the property owners to repay the mortgage loans with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or obtain refinancing.  The mortgage revenue bonds are not personal obligations of the property owners, and the Partnership relies solely on the value of the properties securing these bonds for security.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Similarly, if a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond goes into default, the Partnership's only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying multifamily property.  If the value of the underlying property securing the bond is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the bond, the Partnership will suffer a loss.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond is not sold prior to the maturity or remarketing of the bond, any participating or contingent interest payable from the net sale or refinancing proceeds of the underlying property will be determined on the basis of the appraised value of the underlying property.  Real estate appraisals represent only an estimate of the value of the property being appraised and are based on subjective determinations, such as the extent to which the properties are comparable to the property being evaluated and the rate at which a prospective purchaser would capitalize the cash flow of the property to determine a purchase price.  Accordingly, such appraisals may result in the Partnership realizing less contingent interest from a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond than it would have been realized had the underlying property been sold.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>

<UL>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>There is additional credit risk when the Partnership makes a taxable loan on a property.</LI><p></P></b></UL><DIR>
<DIR>
<B>

</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taxable mortgage loans which are made by the Partnership to owners of the properties which secure mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership are nonrecourse obligations of the property owner.  As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments on these taxable loans is the net rental revenues generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.  The net rental revenue from the operation of a property may be affected by many things as discussed above.  If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the Partnership's taxable loan on such property, a default may occur.  In addition, any payment of principal and interest on a taxable loan on a particular property will be subordinate to payment of all principal and interest (including contingent interest) on the mortgage revenue bond secured by the same property.  As a result, there may be a higher risk of default on the taxable loans than on the mortgage revenue bonds.</P></DIR>

<UL>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The Partnership may suffer adverse consequences from changing interest rates.</LI><p></P></b></UL><DIR>
<DIR>
<B>

</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership has financed the acquisition of some of its assets using variable-rate debt financing.  The interest paid by the Partnership on this financing fluctuates with a specific interest rate index.  If the interest rate index increases, the Partnership's interest expense will increase.  This will reduce the amount of cash the Partnership has available for distribution and may affect the market value of the BUCs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  A decrease in the value of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds could cause the debt financing counterparty to demand additional collateral.  If additional collateral is not available, the debt financing could be terminated in which case the Partnership may incur a loss of the associated net interest income.  A decrease in the value of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds could also decreased the amount the Partnership could realize on the sale of its investments and would decrease the amount of funds available for distribution to BUC holders.</P></DIR>

<UL>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>There are risks associated with the Partnership's debt financing. </LI><p></P></b></UL><DIR>
<DIR>
<B>

</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to obtain debt financing, the Partnership has securitized many of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through the Merrill Lynch P-Float program.  Under this program, the Partnership deposits a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond into a trust which issues a senior P-Float to an institutional investor and a residual interest to the Partnership.  The trust pays interest on the P-Floats and the residual interest from the interest payments received on the underlying tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.  If the trust is unable to pay the full amount of interest due on the P-Float, a default will occur.  In addition, if the value of the mortgage revenue bond and any other collateral declines below a specified level, a default will occur.  In such event, the trust could be terminated and the Partnership may incur a loss of the bonds pledged as collateral.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By using the P-Float program for debt financing, the Partnership foregoes a portion of the interest it would have received on its existing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.  If the Partnership is unable to reinvest the proceeds from this borrowing in investments that generate a greater amount of interest, the amount of net interest income received by the Partnership may decline.</P></DIR>

<DIR>
<B>

</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The majority of the Partnership's assets consist of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.  These mortgage revenue bonds are relatively illiquid and there is no existing trading market for these mortgage revenue bonds.  As a result, there are no market makers, price quotations or other indications of a developed trading market for these mortgage revenue bonds.  In addition, no rating has been issued on any of our existing mortgage revenue bonds and the Partnership does not expect to obtain ratings on mortgage revenue bonds it may acquire in the future.  Accordingly, any buyer of these mortgage revenue bonds would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase.  As a result, the Partnership's ability to sell its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, and the price it may receive upon their sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, the number of similar securities on the market at the time and a number of other market conditions.  As a result, such a sale could result in a loss to the Partnership.</P>

<DIR>
<B>

</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership has used interest rate cap agreements to mitigate its interest rate risks on its debt financing.  However, these derivative transactions do not fully insulate the Partnership from the interest rate risks to which it is exposed.  In addition, the counterparty to certain of these agreements has the right to convert them to fixed rate agreements and it is possible that such a conversion could result in the Partnership paying more interest than it would under its variable-rate financing. There is also a risk that a counterparty to the cap agreements will be unable to perform its obligations under the agreement.</P>

<B>

</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of the properties securing the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants. Since federal subsidies are not generally available on these properties, rents must be charged on a designated portion of the units at a level to permit these units to be continuously occupied by low or moderate income persons or families.  As a result, these rents may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs with respect to these units and debt service on the applicable tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.  This may force the property owner to charge rents on the remaining units that are higher than they would be otherwise and may, therefore, exceed competitive rents which may adversely affect the occupancy rate of a property securing an investment and the developer's ability to service its debt.</P>

<B>

</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This tax-exempt status of the interest paid on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is subject to compliance by the underlying properties with the bond documents and covenants required by the bond issuing authority.  If the tax-exempt status of any of the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds is successfully challenged, the interest income paid on that bond will be includable in gross income for federal tax purposes.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, residual interests in certain tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through securitization programs, such as the P-Floats/RITES program, which entitles the Partnership to a share of the tax-exempt interest of these mortgage revenue bonds.  It is possible that the characterization of the residual interest could be challenged and the income the Partnership receives through these residual interests could be treated as ordinary taxable income.  If the IRS were to successfully challenge the tax-exempt status of interest received by the Partnership, a BUC holder's distributive share of this income will be taxable to the BUC holder regardless of whether an amount of cash equal to such distributive share is actually distributed to him or her.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certain of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at rates which include participating or contingent interest.  Payment of the contingent interest depends on the amount of cash flow from, and proceeds upon sale of, the property securing the bond.  An issue may arise as to whether the relationship between the Partnership and the property owner is that of debtor and creditor or whether the Partnership is engaged in a partnership or joint venture with the property owner.  If the IRS were to determine that tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds represented an equity investment in the underlying property, the interest paid to the Partnership could be viewed as a taxable return on such investment and would not qualify as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership has obtained unqualified legal opinions to the effect that interest on its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.  However, these legal opinions have no binding effect on the IRS or the courts, and no assurances can be given that the conclusions reached will not be contested by the IRS or, if contested, will be sustained by a court.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department.  Changes to the tax law, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect the Partnership and its BUC holders.  It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what forms or with what effective dates the tax law applicable to the Partnership will be changed.</P></DIR>

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations.</P>
</B>
<P><B>General</B><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership was formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, operating, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.  The Partnership's business objectives are to: (i) preserve and protect its capital; (ii) provide regular cash distributions to BUC holders and (iii) provide a potential for an enhanced federally tax-exempt yield as a result of a participation interest in the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the real estate financed by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The Partnership is pursuing a business strategy to: (i) increase the amount of tax-exempt interest available for distribution to its BUC holders; (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and interest rate hedging; and (iii) achieve economies of scale.  The Partnership seeks to achieve its objectives through the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the tax-exempt securities market and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The Partnership's primary assets are its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which provide permanent financing for nine multifamily housing properties.  A description of the multifamily housing properties collateralizing the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership at December 31, 2002 is as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="image409.gif" WIDTH=750 HEIGHT=340></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aggregate carrying value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds at December 31, 2002 was $118,528,538.  The carrying value reflects the Partnership's estimate of the fair value as no public market exists for these bonds.  The estimated fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is calculated by discounting each bond's expected future cash flows using discount rates for comparable tax-exempt investments.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bears tax-exempt
  interest at a fixed rate and provides for the payment of additional contingent
  interest that is payable solely from available net cash flow generated by the
  financed property. The principal amounts of seven of the bonds do not amortize
  over their respective terms. The terms of the remaining two bonds provide for
  semiannual payments of principal and interest out of operating cash flow.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership has pursued its investment growth strategy
  by investing in additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and related investments
  and financing such acquisitions through the use of cash reserves, proceeds from
  sales of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the sale of senior interests
  (securitizations) in its existing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. The Partnership
  may also finance such acquisitions through the issuance of additional BUCs.
  By acquiring additional investments, the Partnership hopes to: (i) increase
  the amount of tax-exempt interest available for distribution to BUC holders;
  (ii) reduce risk through increased asset diversification; and (iii) achieve
  improved economies of scale. By financing the acquisition of additional investments
  through securitizations, the Partnership intends to take advantage of attractive
  financing alternatives to enhance the overall return of the Partnership. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of December 31, 2002 the Partnership has securitized $59,630,000
  of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond portfolio and has pledged a total of
  $112,056,000 of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond portfolio and other tax-exempt
  bonds in connection with the securitizations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In keeping with its investment growth strategy, in September
  2002 the Partnership entered into a plan to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bonds totaling $8,020,000 secured by Fairmont Oaks Apartments in Gainsville,
  Florida. The Partnership intends to acquire the tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bonds in the first quarter of 2003 when the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds
  are refunded and restructured by the Florida Housing Authority. The tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds are expected to be restructured with a base interest
  rate of 6.2% and a contingent interest rate of 2.2%. The Partnership intends
  to finance the acquisition of the Fairmont Oaks tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bonds using the Merrill Lynch P-float securitization program. As part of this
  plan, the Partnership has pledged $5,950,000 of its Primary Trust Certificates
  secured by the Northwoods Lake Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bond. In connection
  with this planned acquisition, the Partnership has loaned $1,042,414 to the
  owner of Fairmont Oaks Apartments in the form of a taxable loan bearing interest
  at 6.5% and maturing in October 2022. The purpose of the taxable loan is to
  facilitate the Partnership's acquisition of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bonds. The owners of the Fairmont Oaks Apartments are employees of the general
  partner of AFCA 2.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  </P>
<B><P>Critical Accounting Policies<BR>
</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership considers its critical accounting policies to be: (i) the accounting for and the valuation of its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the related recognition of interest income; (ii) the accounting for and the valuation of its investments in taxable loans and the related recognition of interest income; (iii) the accounting for interest rate risk management instruments; and (iv) the accurate presentation and disclosure of its securitization transactions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Partnership has classified its investments in tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt bonds as available-for-sale and,
  as such, they are reflected at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standard No. 115, &quot;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
  and Equity Securities&quot; (FAS 115). The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds
  have a limited market. As such, the Partnership estimates the fair value for
  each bond as the present value of its expected cash flows using a discount rate
  for comparable tax-exempt investments. This calculation methodology encompasses
  judgment in its application, especially in the determination of the discount
  rate. The Partnership periodically reviews the credit risk exposure associated
  with the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds by reviewing the estimated fair value
  of the underlying collateral to determine whether an other-than-temporary-impairment
  exists. When the Partnership believes that it is probable that it will not collect
  all amounts due, including principal and accrued interest, under the terms of
  the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, an other-than-temporary impairment is
  recorded. If an other-than-temporary-impairment exists, the cost basis of the
  mortgage bond is written down to its estimated fair value, with the amount of
  the write-down accounted for as a realized loss. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership bases the fair value of its other tax-exempt
  bonds, which also have a limited market, on quotes from external sources, such
  as brokers, for these or similar bonds. A decrease or increase in the discount
  rate increases or decreases, respectively, the estimate of fair value. Furthermore,
  volatility in the interest rate real estate markets may also likely cause uncertainty
  in the estimated valuation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interest income received by the Partnership from its tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying
  properties. Base interest income on fully performing tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bonds is recognized as it is accrued. Base interest income on tax-exempt mortgage
  revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received. Past due
  base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously
  not fully performing, is recognized as received. Contingent interest income,
  which is only received by the Partnership if the properties financed by the
  tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds generate excess available cash flow as set
  forth in each bond, is recognized as received. At December 31, 2002, all of
  the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were fully performing. The
  Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt mortgage
  bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Investments in taxable loans</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Investments in taxable loans are stated at the lower of cost
  or market, less an allowance for estimated losses. The Partnership measures
  impairment of a taxable loan in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
  Standard No. 114, &quot;Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" (FAS
  114). FAS 114 requires a creditor to base its measure of loan impairment either
  on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's
  effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral. The Partnership's
  allowance for estimated losses on its taxable loans is calculated using discounted
  expected future cash flows generated by the underlying property. The estimated
  future cash flow of each underlying property is subject to a significant amount
  of judgment in the estimation of future rental receipts, future rental expenses,
  future capital expenditures and future selling price of the property. Such estimates
  are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets
  in which the properties operate and tax and insurance expenses. Different conditions
  or different assumptions applied to the calculation would likely result in materially
  different amounts. The Partnership periodically compares its estimates with
  historical results to evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of its estimates
  and adjust its estimates accordingly. Interest income on the taxable loans is
  recognized as accrued. The accrual of interest on the taxable loans is suspended
  for financial reporting purposes when the Partnership believes collection is
  doubtful and is reinstated when the loan's ability to perform is adequately
  demonstrated. The suspension of interest income accrual and the determination
  to reinstate are subject to a degree of judgment, the results of which when
  applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact
  on the financial statements. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Interest rate cap agreements</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership's investments in interest rate cap agreements
  are accounted for under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
  Standards No. 133, &quot;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&quot;
  and Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, &quot;Accounting
  for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities&quot;. These
  statements (collectively, &quot;FAS 133&quot;) establish accounting and reporting
  standards for derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative
  financial instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activity.
  FAS 133 requires the Partnership to recognize all derivatives as either assets
  or liabilities in its financial statements and record these instruments at their
  fair values. In order to achieve hedge accounting treatment, hedging activities
  must be appropriately designated, documented and proven to be effective as a
  hedge pursuant to the provisions of FAS 133.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At inception, the Partnership designated each of the interest
  rate cap agreements as cash flow hedges of its floating rate debt financing.
  The hedges are considered highly effective at inception as the critical terms
  of the caps and the floating rate debt financing such as effective maturity,
  floating index and principal hedged are substantially the same. This means that
  the calculation of effectiveness is made when the floating rate is greater than
  the strike rate of the cap agreements. The fair value of the caps at inception
  are their original cost, which is all attributable to their time value as the
  strike rates of the caps are greater than the current floating rate. Changes
  in the time value, or fair value, of the caps will be marked to market with
  the difference recognized in earnings as interest expense over the term of the
  caps. The current floating rate of the floating index (BMA) is lower than the
  rate at which the caps would go into effect, therefore the only current financial
  statement impact is to recognize the change in the estimated fair value of the
  cap agreements in the income statement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Securitization transactions</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership has financed the acquisition of and/or securitized
  a substantial portion of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond portfolio using
  securitizations through the Merrill Lynch P-Float program. Through this program,
  the Partnership structures a transaction by depositing a tax-exempt mortgage
  bond into a trust that issues P-Floats and RITES. The Partnership has a call
  right on the senior floating rate securities and, upon exercise of such right,
  may collapse the trusts and, therefore, retains a level of control over such
  securities. The Partnership accounts for these transactions in accordance with
  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, &quot;Transfers of Financial
  Assets&quot; (FAS 140). The Partnership has determined it has maintained control
  over the transferred assets in these transactions and thus accounts and presents
  them as financing transactions and not sales. FAS 140 further requires an entity
  that has securitized financial assets to disclose information about accounting
  policies, volume, cash flows, key assumptions made in determining fair value
  of retained interests and the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions. The
  level of adequate and full disclosure required by FAS 140 is subject to a degree
  of judgment which, if not appropriately disclosed, could have a material impact
  on the presentation of the financial statements. The Partnership believes it
  has complied with the full disclosure requirements of FAS 140.</P>
<P><B>Results of Operations</b></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership recorded net income of $6,660,368 for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to net income of $6,352,336 for the year ended December 31, 2001.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The multi-family housing industry is experiencing soft market conditions which are attributable to three factors: i) recessionary conditions is certain markets; ii) over-building; and iii) record levels of single family home purchases largely due to record low mortgage interest rates.  These factors have reduced the availability and increased the competition for credit worthy tenants, which in turn reduces effective rents in the form of concessions and increases operating costs such as leasing incentives.  At December 31, 2002, all of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are paying their full amount of base interest; however a prolonged weakened economy and the resulting decline in net rental revenues from the Partnership's collateral of multi-family properties may negatively impact future interest income.  Furthermore, the collection of contingent interest payable from the excess cash flow of the underlying properties may decrease significantly in times of economic slowdown.  The Partnership remains aware of this potential and continues to monitor the performance of the multi-family properties collateralizing its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.  Offsetting these weak conditions are the positive economic benefits the Partnership is experiencing from the record low interest rates it is paying on its variable-rate debt.</P>
<P>The tables below compare the results of operations for each year shown.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="image410.gif" WIDTH=581 HEIGHT=636></P>
<P><I>Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001<BR>
</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mortgage revenue bond investment income increased $57,833 (.1%) from 2001 to 2002.  An increase of approximately $673,500 is attributable to earning a full year of base interest in 2002 on the Lake Forest Apartments bond which was acquired December 2001.  In addition, the Partnership received approximately $31,000 of past due base interest from the Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, approximately $23,000 of past due base interest from the Woodbridge Apartments of Bloomington tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds due to an increase in the net cash flow generated by the underlying properties and an increase of approximately $15,000 is attributable to the Ashley Square tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.  Offsetting such increases were declines of approximately $346,000 due to the sale of the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, a decline of approximately $255,000 due to a decrease in past due base interest received on its Northwoods Lake Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, approximately a $77,000 decrease due to the December 2001 sale of the Shoals Crossing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and a decline of approximately $6,000 in past due interest received by the Iona Lakes Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond in 2002 compared to 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership earned the full amount of its base interest
  due on all of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held at December 31, 2002,
  except for the Ashley Square tax-exempt mortgage bond, which earned approximately
  $1,600 less than its base interest. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other bond investment income represents income earned on the
  Partnership's investment in other tax-exempt bonds which increased $14,094 from
  2001 to 2002 due to its $900,000 investment acquired in the first quarter of
  2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other interest income represents income earned on the Partnership's
  taxable loans and cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in 2002 from 2001
  of $120,070 (22%) is primarily due to a decrease of approximately $62,000 in
  taxable loan interest income due to the loans being placed on non-accrual status
  in the fourth quarter of 2002, and a decrease of approximately $58,000 in interest
  on its cash and cash equivalents due to the continued decline in interest rates
  earned on its cash and cash equivalents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No contingent interest income was earned from any tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds for the year 2002. The Partnership earned $16,897 of
  contingent interest income in 2001 from its Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest tax-exempt
  mortgage bond ($10,000) and its Bent Tree Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bond
  ($6,897) due to an increase in net cash flows generated by the respective underlying
  properties. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership recorded a realized loss of $150,000 on its
  taxable loans in 2001; no such loss was recorded in 2002. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership may make taxable loans for the purpose of acquiring the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the same property or to provide capital project funding to a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond already owned by the Partnership.  Therefore, the business purpose of the Partnership making the taxable loans is not solely to earn taxable income, but rather to acquire a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or to improve the condition of a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.  In all cases, the taxable loans are subordinate to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.  The interest payable on the taxable loan is only paid by the property after the payment of: i) the tax-exempt base interest on the tax-exempt bond; and ii) the tax-exempt contingent interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.  Due to the current weak market conditions of the multi-family industry and the competition from over-building and single-family housing, the underlying properties are not generating enough cash flow to cover the interest on the taxable mortgage loan due from Northwoods, although the underlying properties are fully servicing the base interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.  Therefore, the taxable loan due from Northwoods was placed on non-accrual status on October 1, 2002.  As a result, the Partnership will discontinue accruing interest income on such taxable loan and will only record interest income from the loan when it is received.  Until the loans are removed from non-accrual status the Partnership will not be generating annual income of approximately $417,000, which represents approximately $.04 per BUC thereby reducing future annual net income and Cash Available for Distribution (CAD) of the Partnership by the same amount.  CAD per BUC was $.67 and distributions per BUC were $.54, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002.  Until such loans are restored to accrual status, any interest income on the taxable loans for financial statement purposes will only be recognized when received.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interest expense decreased for the Partnership's debt financing
  by $427,407 (22.5%) from 2001 to 2002. A decrease of approximately $740,000
  is due to a significant decline in the short term tax-exempt interest rates.
  The Partnership's effective interest rate on the variable-rate debt financing
  was 2.3% in 2002, compared to 3.17% in 2001. This decrease is offset by an increase
  of approximately $243,000 is due to a full year of interest expense on the Partnership's
  December 2001 securitization transaction to acquire the Lake Forest Apartments
  tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond. The Partnership has entered into two derivative
  agreements in order to mitigate its exposure to interest rates on its variable-rate
  debt financing. An increase of approximately $61,000 is due to interest rate
  cap expense on the cap agreement that was purchased in July of 2002 and an increase
  of approximately $8,000 is due to the interest rate cap expense for the purchase
  of a convertible rate cap in November of 2002. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amortization expense decreased $54,132 from 2001 to 2002 primarily
  due to the 2001 write-off of approximately $64,000 in unamortized bond issuance
  costs related to the Shoals Crossing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which
  was sold in December 2001. Such decrease was partially offset by an increase
  of amortization on the P-Float transactions and the amortization of the bond
  issuance costs related to the purchase of the Lake Forest Apartments tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds acquired in December 2001. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General and administrative expenses increased $258,467 (28%)
  from 2001 to 2002 due to: (i) an increase of approximately $182,000 in tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bond servicing and bond trustee fees; (ii) an increase of approximately
  $36,000 in legal fees; and (iii) a net increase of $40,000 in other general
  and administrative expenses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to the Year Ended
  December 31, 2000</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Mortgage bond investment income increased $1,497,376 (21%)
  from 2000 to 2001, of which approximately $1,537,000 is attributable to earning
  a full year of base interest in 2001 on the Iona Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake
  Colony Apartments and Bent Tree Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds
  which were acquired in March, June and December 2000, respectively. In addition,
  the Partnership received $150,000 of past due base interest in connection with
  the December 2001 sale of the Shoals Crossing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond,
  received approximately $75,000 of past due base interest on its Northwoods Lake
  Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond due to an increase in the net cash
  flow generated by the underlying property, and earned approximately $61,000
  on the Lake Forest Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond acquired in December
  2001. Offsetting these increases were declines of approximately $258,000 attributable
  to the sale of the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond in September
  2000, and a net decline of approximately $68,000 in mortgage bond investment
  income earned by the Partnership's other four tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds,
  primarily due to variations in the amount of past due interest received in 2001
  compared to 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership earned the full amount of its base interest
  due on all of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held at December 31, 2001,
  except for the Ashley Square tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, which earned
  $21,000 less than its base interest. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other bond investment income represents income earned on the
  Partnership's investment in other tax-exempt bonds which increased $286,344
  from 2000 to 2001 due to a full year of interest earned on the Partnership's
  $3,000,000 investment acquired in November 2000 and its $900,000 investment
  acquired in the first quarter of 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other interest income represents income earned on the Partnership's
  taxable loans and cash and cash equivalents. The increase in 2001 from 2000
  of $84,173 (18%) is primarily due to an increase of approximately $2,000,000
  in taxable loans, offset by a decrease in interest rates earned on its cash
  and cash equivalents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership earned $16,897 of contingent interest income
  in 2001 from its Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest tax-exempt mortgage bond ($10,000)
  and its Bent Tree Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bond ($6,897) due to an increase
  in net cash flows generated by the respective underlying properties. No contingent
  interest income was earned from any tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for the
  comparable period of 2000. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2000, the Partnership realized a loss of $1,100,000
  on the sale of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond secured by Arama Apartments.
  No such loss was recorded in 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership recorded a realized loss of $150,000 on its
  taxable loans in 2001. No such loss was recorded in 2000. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interest expense on the Partnership's debt financing increased
  $452,304 (31%) from 2000 to 2001 which is due to a full year of interest expense
  on the Partnership's 2000 securitization transactions to acquire the Iona Lakes
  Apartments, Clear Lake Colony Apartments, and Bent Tree Apartments tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds and the December 2001 securitization transaction to acquire
  the Lake Forest Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond. The increase in
  interest expense resulting from higher outstanding debt financing was partially
  offset by a decline in the short term tax-exempt interest rates. The Partnership's
  effective interest rate on the debt financing was 3.17% in 2001 compared to
  5.10% in 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amortization expense increased $57,027 from 2000 to 2001 primarily
  due to the write-off of approximately $64,000 in unamortized bond issuance costs
  related to the Shoals Crossing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which was sold
  in December 2001. Such increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately
  $7,000 of amortization on the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond
  which was sold in September 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General and administrative expenses decreased $17,914 (2%)
  from 2000 to 2001, not attributable to any particular items.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Liquidity and Capital Resources</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $343,607 in 2002 compared to 2001.  This decrease is primarily due to decreases in accounts payable offset by an increase in interest receivable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cash used in investing activities decreased $7,463,159 in 2002 compared to 2001 which is due to the decrease in the acquisitions of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds in 2002 and decreases in the advances for the taxable loans offset by the sale of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds in 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cash used in financing activities decreased $11,267,416 in 2002 compared to 2001, due to the decrease in proceeds received from debt financing in the acquisition of the Lake Forest tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds in 2001, offset by an increase in cash used for purchasing an interest rate cap agreements to mitigate exposure to increases in interest rates on the Partnership's variable-rate debt financing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tax-exempt interest earned on the mortgage bonds represents the Partnership's principal source of cash flow.  Tax-exempt interest is primarily comprised of base interest on the mortgage bonds.  The Partnership will also receive from time to time contingent interest on the mortgage bonds.  Contingent interest is only paid when the underlying properties generate excess cash flow, therefore, cash in-flows are fairly fixed in nature and increase when the underlying properties have strong economic performances and when the Partnership acquires additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership's principal uses of cash are the payment of distributions to BUC holders, interest on debt financing and operating expenses.  Distributions to BUC holders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner.  The General Partner determines the amount of the distributions based upon the projected future cash flows of the Partnership.  Future distributions to BUC holders will depend upon the amount of base and contingent interest received on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other investments, the effective interest rate on the Partnership's variable-rate debt financing, and the amount of the Partnership's undistributed cash.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following table sets forth information relating to cash
  distributions paid to BUC holders for the years shown:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="image411.gif" WIDTH=724 HEIGHT=124></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interest expense on the Partnership's variable-rate debt financing is not fixed and will fluctuate depending upon the BMA Index.  This rate, which does not include liquidity, credit enhancement, remarketing, trustee and custodian fees that approximate 90 basis points, has ranged between 1.01% to 1.85% in 2002 and 1.10% to 4.48% in 2001.  To manage the uncertainty of this variable expense, the Partnership has capped the interest rate, which includes fees of approximately 90 basis points, on $45 million of its debt financing at 3.9% ($30 million) and 4.4% ($15 million).  Interest expense will also increase or decrease depending upon the outstanding balance of the debt financing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee expenses, accounting expenses and legal expenses.  One of the benefits of the Partnership's growth strategy is to take advantage of the nature of these expenses to achieve economies of scale.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership believes that cash provided by net interest
  income from its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other investments, supplemented,
  if necessary, by withdrawals from its reserve, will be adequate to meet its
  projected short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including the payment
  of expenses, interest and distributions to BUC holders.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>New Accounting Pronouncements</b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, <I>Accounting for Asset
  Retirement Obligations.</I> SFAS No. 143 requires the Partnership to record
  the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period
  in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible
  long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development,
  and/or normal use of the assets. The Partnership also records a corresponding
  asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial
  measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation will be adjusted
  at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the
  estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. The Partnership is required
  to adopt SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not
  expected to have a material effect on the Partnership's financial statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, <I>Rescission
  of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
  Technical Corrections</I>. SFAS No. 145 amends existing guidance on reporting
  gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt to prohibit the classification
  of the gain or loss as extraordinary, as the use of such extinguishments have
  become part of the risk management strategy of many companies. SFAS No. 145
  also amends SFAS No. 13 to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease
  modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions.
  The provisions of the Statement related to the rescission of Statement No. 4
  is applied in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Earlier application
  of these provisions is encouraged. The provisions of the Statement related to
  Statement No. 13 were effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002,
  with early application encouraged. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 is not expected
  to have a material effect on the Partnership's financial statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, <I>Accounting for
  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities</I>. SFAS No. 146 addresses
  financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
  activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 94-3, <I>Liability
  Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
  an Activity</I>. The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or
  disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application
  encouraged. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material
  effect on the Partnership's financial statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's
  Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
  of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and
  107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This Interpretation elaborates
  on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
  statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. The Interpretation
  also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a
  guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The
  initial recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation are applicable
  to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and are not expected
  to have a material effect on the Partnership's financial statements. The disclosure

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, <I>Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51.</I> This Interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the Interpretation. The Interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after January 31, 2003.  For public enterprises, such as the Partnership, with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before February 1, 2003, the Interpretation is applied to the enterprise no later than the end of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003<A NAME="_ftnref2"></A>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Item 7A.<a name="item7a"></a></B> Quantitative and Qualitative
  Disclosures About Market Risk. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership's primary market risk exposures are interest
  rate risk and credit risk. The Partnership's exposure to market risks relates
  primarily to its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and its debt
  financing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Interest Rate Risk</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including
  governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic
  and political considerations and other factors beyond the Partnership's control.
  The nature of the Partnership's investment in the tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bonds and the debt financing used to finance the acquisitions expose the Partnership
  to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds bear base interest at fixed rates and may additionally
  pay contingent interest which fluctuates based upon the cash flows of the underlying
  property. The weighted average base rate and maturity of the tax-exempt mortgage
  revenue bonds were 7.2% and mature beyond 2007 at December 31, 2002. Conversely,
  the interest rates on the Partnership's floating rate debt financing fluctuate
  based on the BMA &quot;Bond Market Association&quot; Rate plus approximately
  90 basis points in various fees. The BMA Rate is reset weekly. Accordingly,
  the Partnership's cost of borrowing will increase as the BMA Rate increases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership is managing its interest rate risk on its debt financing by entering into interest rate cap agreements that cap the amount of interest expense it could pay on its floating rate debt financing as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="image412.gif" WIDTH=756 HEIGHT=272></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using the cap agreements, the Partnership is able to benefit from the current low interest rate environment, while still remaining protected from a significant increase in the floating rates.  Bank of America does have the right to convert two of the cap agreements to a fixed rate swap, in which case the Partnership's interest expense would be fixed, but at higher interest rates than the current floating rate.  Should the BMA Rate continue to remain low or further decline, they could exercise such option.  The weighted-average effective rate of the debt financing was 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002.  At December 31, 2002, the Partnership had total debt financing outstanding of $59,730,000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stated maturity dates of the Partnership's debt financing
  are as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size=2><img src="image413.gif" width=283 height=183></font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the average BMA rate, including fees, had increased or decreased
  by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2002, the interest expense
  payments on the variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased
  by approximately $600,000, respectively. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The average BMA Index, including fees, would have had to increase by approximately 160 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2002 in order to reach the level of the Partnership's interest rate cap agreements.  In the event of a significant unfavorable fluctuation in interest rates, the Partnership may collapse each of the financing transactions based upon the terms of its call feature in the respective securitization.  The BMA rate, net of any fees, ranged from 1.01% to 1.85% during the year ended December 31, 2002, while the base rates of the securitized tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds range from 6.9% to 7.5% at December 31, 2002.  In the event that the BMA rate rises dramatically and exceeds the base rate of the securitized tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, the trust would be collapsed as a result of insufficient interest from the underlying fixed-rate tax-exempt mortgage bond to service the floating rate senior interest obligations of the P-Float.  A decrease in the net interest income earned through the structure of the securitizations would decrease cash available for distributions. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fair value of the Partnership's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which bear fixed base interest rates, is also directly impacted by changes in market interest rates.  A decrease in market rates below the respective bond's base interest rate will cause the fair value to increase.  Conversely, an increase in rates will cause the fair value of the bonds to decrease.  The aggregate fair value of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was $118,528,538 at December 31, 2002.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Credit Risk</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership's primary credit risk is the risk of default
  on its portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans collateralized
  by the multifamily properties. The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are not
  direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issued the bonds and
  are not guaranteed by such authorities or any insurer or other party. In addition,
  the mortgage bonds and the associated taxable loans are nonrecourse obligations
  of the property owner. As a result, the sole source of principal and interest
  payments (including both base and contingent interest) on the tax-exempt mortgage
  revenue bonds and the taxable loans is the net rental revenues generated by
  these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a
  level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the Partnership's
  tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan on such property, a default
  may occur. A property's ability to generate net rental income is subject to
  a wide variety of factors, including, rental and occupancy rates of the property
  and the level of operating expenses. Occupancy rates and rents are directly
  affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in
  which a property is located. This, in turn, is affected by several factors such
  as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction
  and on the affordability of single-family homes. In addition, factors such as
  government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other
  taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations
  of an apartment property.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Defaults on its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable
  loans may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to BUC
  holders. In addition, if a property's net rental income declines, it may affect
  the market value of the property. If the market value of a property deteriorates,
  the amount of net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property
  may be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of the tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan secured by the property.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event of a default on a tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bond or taxable loan, the Partnership will have the right to foreclose on the
  mortgage or deed of trust securing the property. If the Partnership takes ownership
  of the property securing a defaulted tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, it will
  be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property. However, such
  amounts will no longer represent tax-exempt interest to the Partnership. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership's primary method of managing the credit risks
  associated with its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans is to
  perform a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the properties
  securing these mortgage bonds and loans and to carefully monitor the performance
  of such property on a continuous basis.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership is also exposed to a credit risk with respect
  to its debt financing. All of the Partnership's debt financing has been obtained
  using securitizations issued through the Merrill Lynch P-Float program. In this
  program, the senior interests sold are credit enhanced by Merrill Lynch or its
  affiliate. The inability of Merrill Lynch or its affiliate to perform under
  the program or impairment of the credit enhancement may terminate the transaction
  and cause the Partnership to lose the net interest income earned as a result.
  The Partnership recognizes the concentration of financing with this institution
  and periodically monitors its ability to continue to perform. In addition, the
  Partnership's interest rate cap agreements are with two other counterparties.
  The $20 million rate cap agreement is with Bear Stearns and the $10 million
  and $15 million rate cap agreements are with Bank of America.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the above information incorporates only those material positions
  or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2002, it does not consider those
  exposures or positions that could arise after that date. The Partnership's ultimate
  economic impact with respect to market risks will depend on the exposures that
  arise during the period, the Partnership's risk mitigating strategies at that
  time and overall business and economic environment.</P>

<P>To the Partners<BR>
America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P.:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related statements of income and comprehensive income, partners' capital and cash flows for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
  present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of America

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. the (&quot;Partnership&quot;) was formed on April 2, 1998 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments  The Partnership will terminate on December 31, 2050, unless terminated earlier under the provisions of its Partnership Agreement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A)&#9;<I>Financial Statement Presentation</i></P>
<DIR><DIR>
<I>

</i><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>B)&#9;<I>Investment in Tax-Exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Other Tax-Exempt Bonds<BR>
</i></P><DIR>
  <DIR> <I> </i>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership accounts for its investments in tax-exempt
      mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds under
      the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115, &quot;Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities&quot; (&quot;FAS 115&quot;).
      FAS 115 requires the classification of investments in securities into one
      of three categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. The
      Partnership has classified all of its investments in tax-exempt mortgage
      revenue bonds and other tax-exempt bonds as available-for-sale. Investments
      classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with the net
      unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income. Unrealized
      gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions
      to BUC holders, or the characterization of the tax-exempt interest income
      of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral. </P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds have a limited market.
      As such, the Partnership estimates the fair value for each bond as the present
      value of its expected cash flows using a discount rate for comparable tax-exempt
      investments. The Partnership bases the fair value of the other tax-exempt
      bonds, which also have a limited market, on quotes from external sources,
      such as brokers, for these or similar bonds. </P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership periodically evaluates the credit risk
      exposure associated with the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds by reviewing
      the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral to determine whether
      an other-than-temporary impairment exists. When the Partnership believes
      that it is probable that it will not collect all amounts due, including
      principal and accrued interest, under the terms of the tax-exempt mortgage
      revenue bonds, an other-than-temporary impairment is recorded. If an other-than-temporary
      impairment exists, the cost basis of the respective bond is written down
      to its estimated fair value, with the amount of the write-down accounted
      for as a realized loss.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interest income received by the Partnership from its
      investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net
      cash flow of the underlying properties. Base interest income on fully-performing
      tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is accrued. Base interest
      income on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized
      as it is received. Past due base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue
      bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized
      as received. Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership
      if the properties financed by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds generate
      excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized as received.
      The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt
      mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated. At
      December 31, 2002 all of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds
      were fully performing as to their base interest.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interest income on other tax-exempt bonds is recognized
      as accrued.</P>

<P>C)&#9;<I>Income Taxes<BR>
</i></P><DIR><DIR>
<I>

</i><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No provision has been made for income taxes since the BUC holders are required to report their share of the Partnership's taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes.  The book basis of the Partnership's assets and liabilities exceeded the tax basis by $2,504,254 and $2,286,464 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. </P>

<P>  D)&#9;<I>Cash Equivalents</I><BR>

</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>  E)&#9;<I>Debt Financing</I>  <BR>
   </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership has financed the acquisition of and/or securitized a portion of its tax-exempt mortgage bond portfolio using securitizations through the Merrill Lynch P-Float program.  Through this program, the Partnership transfers a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond into a trust which issues two types of securities, senior securities (&quot;P-Floats&quot;) and subordinated residual interest securities(&quot;RITES&quot;).  The P-Floats are floating rate securities representing a beneficial ownership interest in the outstanding principal and interest of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, credit enhanced by Merrill Lynch (or a Merrill Lynch affiliate) and are sold to institutional investors.  The RITES are issued to the Partnership and represent a beneficial ownership interest in the remaining interest on such bond.  The Partnership has a call right on the senior floating rate securities and, upon exercise of such right, may collapse the trusts and, therefore, retains a level of control over the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.  In order to collapse the trusts, the cost is equal to the par amount plus 10% of any increase in the market value of the underlying bonds. The Partnership accounts for the securitization transactions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 140, &quot;Transfers of Financial Assets&quot;.  The Partnership has determined it has maintained control over the transferred assets in these transactions, and thus accounts and presents them as financing transactions and not sales. </P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>F)&#9;<I>Other Assets<BR>
</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other assets include taxable loans, debt financing costs, bond reissuance costs, and RITES.</P><DIR>
  <DIR>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership may, from time to time, advance funds in
      the form of a taxable loan to the properties which serve as the underlying
      collateral for the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. The taxable loans
      are solely made to facilitate the Partnership's acquisition of a tax-exempt
      mortgage revenue bond secured by the same property or to provide capital
      project funding to improve the condition of a property. Investments in taxable
      loans are stated at the lower of cost or market, less an allowance for estimated
      losses. The Partnership measures impairment of a taxable loan in accordance
      with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 114, &quot;Accounting
      by Creditors for Impairment Losses&quot;, &quot;FAS 114&quot;. The Partnership's
      allowance for estimated losses on its taxable loans is calculated using
      the discounted expected future cash flows generated by the underlying property.
      Interest income on the taxable loans is recognized as accrued. The accrual
      of interest on the taxable loans is suspended for financial reporting purposes
      when the Partnership believes collection is doubtful and is reinstated when
      the loan's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated. The Partnership's
      taxable loan due from Northwoods Lake was on non-accrual status at December
      31, 2002.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized over
      the stated maturity of the related debt financing agreement.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bond reissuance costs are capitalized and amortized over
      the stated maturity of the related tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership classifies its acquired RITES as available-for-sale
      debt securities and carries the RITES at the estimated fair value which
      was $25,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.</P>

<P>G)&#9;<I>Net Income per BUC<BR>
</i></P><DIR><DIR>
<I>

</i><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Net income per BUC has been calculated based on the weighted average number of BUCs outstanding during each year presented.  The Partnership has no dilutive BUCs and, therefore, basic net income per BUC is the same as diluted net income per BUC.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>H)&#9;<I>Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities</i></P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership accounts for its interest rate cap agreements in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133 &quot;Accounting for Derivatives&quot;.  At the inception, the Partnership designated the interest rate cap agreements as cash flow hedges of floating rate debt financing.  The hedges are considered highly effective at inception as the critical terms of the caps and the floating rate debt financing are substantially the same.  The calculation of effectiveness is made when the floating rate (BMA Municipal Index) is greater than the strike rate of the caps and will exclude the effect of changes in the fair value of the cap.  The fair value of the caps at inception are their cost, which is all attributable to its time value as the strike rates of the caps are greater than the current floating rate.  Changes in the time value, or fair value, of the caps will be marked to market with the difference recognized in earnings over the term of the caps.  Interest rate cap expense was $69,458 for the year ended December 31, 2002, and is included as a component of interest expense in the accompanying financial statements.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
      (&quot;FASB&quot;) issued Financial Accounting Standards (&quot;FAS&quot;)
      No. 141, "Business Combinations" and FAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
      Assets" which provide guidance on how entities are to account for business
      combinations and for the goodwill and other intangible assets that arise
      from those combinations or are acquired otherwise. These standards were
      effective for the Partnership on January 1, 2002. The Partnership presently
      has no goodwill recorded and, as a result, the adoption of the new pronouncements
      did not have a significant impact on the financial statements.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 144, "Accounting
      for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets", which provides guidance on the

<B><P>3.  Partnership Income, Expenses and Cash Distributions<BR>
</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Limited Partnership Agreement of the Partnership contains provisions for the distribution of Net Interest Income, and Net Residual Proceeds (as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement) and for the allocation of income and expenses for tax purposes among AFCA 2 and BUC holders (the &quot;Partners&quot;).  Income and expenses will be allocated to each BUC holder on a periodic basis, as determined by the General Partner, based on the number of BUCs held by each BUC holder as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is to be made.  Distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds will be made to each BUC holder of record on the last day of each distribution period based on the number of BUCs held by each BUC holder as of such date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Net Interest Income, as defined in the Limited Partnership
  Agreement, in each distribution period will be distributed 99% to the BUC holders
  and 1% to AFCA 2. The portion of Net Residual Proceeds, as defined in the Limited
  Partnership Agreement, representing a return of principal will be distributed
  100% to the BUC holders.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Net Interest Income representing
  contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest
  in an amount equal to .9% per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage
  bonds on a cumulative basis will be distributed 75% to the BUC holders and 25%
  to AFCA 2.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the allocation of income and loss from operations,
  if a Partner has a deficit Capital Account balance as of the last day of any
  fiscal year, then all items of income for such fiscal year shall be first allocated
  to such Partner in the amount and manner necessary to eliminate such deficit.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cash distributions are currently made on a quarterly basis
  but may be made on a monthly or semiannual basis if AFCA 2 so elects. </P>
<P><B>4. BUC Repurchases<BR>
  </b><BR>
  In connection with the Partnership's plan to repurchase up to $1,000,000 of
  the Partnership's BUCs, which was implemented in January 2000, the Partnership
  purchased and canceled, in open market transactions, 141,200 BUCs at an aggregate
  cost of $755,929 during 2000. There were no BUC repurchases in 2002 or 2001.</P>

<P><B>5. Investment in Tax-Exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds<BR>
</b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are issued by various state and local governments, their agencies and authorities to finance the construction or rehabilitation of income-producing real estate properties.  However, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds do not constitute an obligation of any state or local government, agency or authority and no state or local government, agency or authority is liable on them, nor is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.  The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are nonrecourse obligations of the respective owners of the properties.  The sole source of the funds to pay principal and interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is the net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the properties.  Each tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, however, is collateralized by a first mortgage on all real and personal property included in the related property and an assignment of rents.  The entire pool of bonds issued to provide permanent financing for each property were issued to the Partnership.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of the bonds bears interest at a fixed rate and provides
  for the payment of additional contingent interest that is payable solely from
  available net cash flow generated by the financed property. The principal amount
  of all but two of the bonds does not amortize over its terms. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2001, the Partnership acquired one tax-exempt mortgage
  revenue bond secured by a multifamily apartment property in the principal amount
  of $10,620,000. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At December 31, 2002 the total amortized cost, gross unrealized
  holding gains and aggregate fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds
  were $114,656,000, $3,872,538 and $118,528,538, respectively. At December 31,
  2001 the total amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains and aggregate
  fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were $114,811,000, $3,594,000
  and $118,405,000, respectively.</P>
<P>Descriptions of the properties collateralizing the tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bonds and certain terms of such bonds are as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2><IMG SRC="image418.gif" WIDTH=665 HEIGHT=305></font>
  <SUP>(1)</SUP> In addition to the base interest rates shown, the bonds bear
  contingent interest, as defined in each revenue note, of an additional 3.5%
  per annum that is payable out of 50% (100% in the case of Shoals Crossing, Ashley
  Pointe at Eagle Crest and Northwoods Lake Apartments) of the net cash flow generated
  by the respective property. The Partnership received contingent interest of
  $10,000 from Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest in 2001. No contingent interest was
  received from any of the other tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds in 2002, 2001
  or 2000. The Partnership sold its investment in the Shoals Crossing tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bond on December 1, 2001 as described below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><SUP>(2)</sup> In addition to the base interest rate shown,
  the bond bears contingent interest, as defined in the revenue note, of an additional
  3% per annum payable out of the net cash flow generated by the property. Past
  due unpaid contingent interest compounds at a rate of 10.5% per annum. The Partnership
  did not receive any contingent interest during 2002, 2001 or 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><SUP>(3)</SUP> In addition to the base interest rate shown,
  the bonds bear contingent interest, as defined in the revenue note, of an additional
  2.6% per annum, 1.885% per annum, 1.9% per annum and 1.6% per annum for Iona
  Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake Colony Apartments, Bent Tree Apartments, and Lake
  Forest Apartments, respectively, payable out of the net cash flow generated
  by each such property. Past due unpaid contingent interest compounds at a rate
  of 9.5% per annum, 8.785% per annum, 9% per annum and 8.5% per annum for Iona
  Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake Colony Apartments, Bent Tree Apartments and Lake
  Forest Apartments, respectively. No contingent interest was received from any
  of the other mortgage bonds during 2002. The Partnership received contingent
  interest of $6,897 from Bent Tree Apartments in 2001. No contingent interest
  was received from any of the other mortgage bonds during 2002, 2001 or 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds in the principal amount of
  $112,056,000 at December 31, 2002 have been pledged as debt financing collateral
  as further described in Note 7 to the Financial Statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reconciliation of the carrying amount of the investment in
  tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<P><IMG SRC="image419.gif" WIDTH=538 HEIGHT=183></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On December 1, 2001, the Partnership sold its investment in the Shoals Crossing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.  The net proceeds from the sale of $4,650,000 represent the full repayment of the $4,500,000 principal of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and $150,000 of past due base interest.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the quarter ended June 30, 2000, the Partnership determined
  it was unlikely to recover or receive its contracted cash flows (including the
  repayment of principal) on its $12,100,000 investment in the Arama Apartments
  tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond despite a loss of $4,000,000 realized on such
  bond during 1998. Accordingly, the Partnership realized an additional loss of
  $1,100,000 on the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond in 2000
  and the carrying value was further written down to a fair value of $7,000,000
  as the new carrying value. On September 11, 2000, the Partnership sold its investment
  in the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond to the obligor of such
  bond for proceeds of $7,000,000. Since the carrying value of such bond was also
  $7,000,000, the Partnership realized no additional loss on the sale.</P>
<P><B>6. Investment in Other Tax-Exempt Bonds</B><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Partnership had an investment in other tax-exempt bonds with a principal amount of $3,900,000.  Such tax-exempt bonds bear interest at the rate of 8.25% per annum and mature on December 1, 2026.  The bonds are guaranteed by an affiliate of the borrower of such funds and have been pledged as additional collateral for the Partnership's Lake Forest Apartments securitization transaction described in Note 7 to Financial Statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At December 31, 2002, the amortized cost, gross unrealized
  gain (loss) and estimated fair value of such securities were $3,900,000, ($21,762)
  and $3,878,238. At December 31, 2001, the amortized cost, gross unrealized gain
  and estimated fair value of such securities were $3,900,000, $39,000 and $3,939,000.</P>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The securitization transactions are accounted for as financing transactions and, in effect, provide variable-rate financing for the acquisition of new, or the securitization of existing, tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.  Accordingly, the $59,730,000 of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds financed are required to be held in trust, the subordinated interests (RITES) are classified as other assets, and, in the case of the $5,000,000 debt financing, the net cash proceeds were classified as cash and cash equivalents. </P>

<P>8. Transactions with Related Parties<BR>
</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Substantially all of the Partnership's general and administrative expenses and certain costs capitalized by the Partnership are paid by AFCA 2 or an affiliate and are reimbursed by the Partnership.  The capitalized costs were incurred in connection with the acquisition or reissuance of certain tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the debt financing transactions.  The amounts of such expenses reimbursed to AFCA 2 or an affiliate are shown below.  The amounts below represent actual cash reimbursements and do not reflect accruals made at each year end.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<P><IMG SRC="image422.gif" WIDTH=521 HEIGHT=277></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AFCA 2 is entitled to receive an administrative fee from the Partnership equal to 0.45% of the outstanding principal balance of any tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or other mortgage investment, unless the owner of the property financed by such tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or other mortgage investment or another third party is required to pay such administrative fee.  For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Partnerships' administrative fees to AFCA 2 were $17,550, $29,431 and $1,425 respectively.  The Partnership may become obligated to pay additional administrative fees to AFCA 2 in the event it acquires additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or other mortgage investments and is not able to negotiate the payment of these fees by the property owners or in the event it acquires title to any of the properties securing its existing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds by reason of foreclosure.  Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses for reimbursed costs and expenses and administrative fees are amounts due AFCA 2 of $44,081 and $284,800 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee equal to 0.45%
  of the original principal amount of the properties financed by the tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds, payable by the owners of such financed properties. AFCA
  2 was also entitled to an administrative fee from the Partnership in the event
  the Partnership became the equity owner of a property by reason of foreclosure.
  AFCA 2 received administrative fees of $375,086, $423,603 and $369,548 in 2002,
  2001 and 2000, respectively, from the owners of properties financed by the tax-exempt
  mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership. Since these administrative fees
  are not Partnership expenses, they have not been reflected in the accompanying
  financial statements. However, such fees are payable by the financed property
  prior to the payment of any contingent interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bonds secured by these properties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AFCA 2 remains entitled to receive approximately $359,000 in
  administrative fees from the Partnership for the year ended December 31, 1989.
  The payment of these fees, which has been deferred by AFCA 2, is contingent
  upon, and will be paid only out of future profits realized by the Partnership
  from the disposition of any Partnership assets. These deferred fees will be
  recorded as an expense by the Partnership when it is probable that these fees
  will be paid.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AFCA 2 earned mortgage placement fees of $106,200 during the
  year ended December 31, 2001 in connection with the acquisition to Lake Forest
  Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds during 2001. The mortgage placement
  fees were paid by the owners of the respective apartment properties and, accordingly,
  have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements. No such fees
  were earned in 2002. <BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An affiliate of AFCA 2 was retained to provide property management services for Ashley Square, Northwoods Lake Apartments, Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest, Shoals Crossing, Iona Lakes Apartments (beginning in April 2000), Clear Lake Colony Apartments (beginning in June 2000), Bent Tree Apartments (beginning in December 2000) and Lake Forest Apartments (beginning in April 2001). The management fees paid to the affiliate of AFCA 2 amounted to $604,793 in 2002, $585,393 in 2001, and $478,179 in 2000.  These management fees are not Partnership expenses and, accordingly, have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  However, such fees are paid out of the revenues generated by these properties prior to the payment of any interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Partnership on these properties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>9. Taxable Loans</b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership's other assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001 include taxable loans of $7,301,165 and $5,739,757, respectively.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership may make taxable loans for the purpose of acquiring
  the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the same property or to provide
  capital project funding to a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue
  bond already owned by the Partnership. Therefore, the business purpose of the
  Partnership making the taxable loans is not solely to earn taxable income, but
  rather to acquire a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or to improve the condition
  of a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond. In all cases, the
  taxable loans are subordinate to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. The
  interest payable on the taxable loan is only paid by the property after the
  payment of: i) the tax-exempt base interest on the tax-exempt bond; and ii)
  the tax-exempt contingent interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
  Due to the current weak market conditions of the multi-family industry and the
  competition from over-building and single-family housing, certain underlying
  properties are not generating enough cash flow to cover the interest on the
  taxable loans, although the underlying properties are fully servicing the base
  interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. Therefore, the taxable loan
  due from Northwoods was placed on non-accrual status on October 1, 2002. As
  a result, the Partnership will discontinue accruing interest income on such
  taxable loan and will only record interest income from the loan when it is received.
  The total of the forgone interest associated with the taxable loans being placed
  on non-accrual status was $98,812 for the fourth quarter ending December 31,
  2002. Until the loans are removed from non-accrual status the Partnership will
  not be generating annual income of approximately $417,000, which represents
  approximately $.04 per BUC. Until such loans are restored to accrual status,
  any interest income on the taxable loans for financial statement purposes will
  only be recognized when received.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The taxable loan of $6,258,751 due from the owners of Northwoods
  Lake Apartments was originated in December of 2001, bears interest at 6.5% per
  annum and is collateralized by the property. The taxable loan terms provide
  for interest only payments, which are subordinate to the payment of the base
  interest, until December 2021, when the full amount of principal becomes due
  and payable. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Partnership restructured and
  assigned its taxable loans due from Iona Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake Colony
  Apartments, Bent Tree Apartments and Lake Forest Apartments to Northwoods Lake
  Apartments at par plus accrued interest. The accompanying 2001 financial statements
  reflect one taxable loan of $5,739,759, due from Northwoods Lake Apartments
  and a realized loss on the taxable loans of $150,000 for the year ended December
  31, 2001. The note was placed on non-accrual status in October 2002 The owners
  of the aforementioned properties are employees of the general partner of AFCA
  2.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The taxable loan of $1,042,414 due from the owners of Fairmont Oaks Apartments was originated in September 2002, bears interest at 6.5% per annum and is collateralized by the property.  The terms of the loan provide for interest only payments, which are subordinate to the payment of the base interest, until September 2022, when the full amount of principal becomes due and payable.  The purpose of the taxable loan is to facilitate the Partnership's acquisition of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by Fairmont Oaks Apartments, which is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2003.  The owners of Fairmont Oaks Apartments are employees of the general partner of AFCA 2.</P>
<P><B>10. Interest Rate Cap Agreements </b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership has entered into three derivative agreements in order to mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable-rate debt financing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On July 1, 2002, the Partnership purchased an interest rate cap from Bear Stearns Financial Products, Inc.  The interest rate cap was purchased at a $489,000 premium, has a cap on the floating rate index of 3%, has a notional amount of $20,000,000 and matures on July 1, 2006.  It effectively caps the floating rate index (the BMA Municipal Index) at 3%, so the maximum interest rate to be paid on $20,000,000 of debt financing is 3% plus remarketing, credit enhancement, liquidity and trustee fees which aggregate to approximately 90 basis points.  The interest rate cap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge of the variable-rate debt financing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On November 1, 2002, the Partnership purchased a convertible interest rate cap from Bank of America.  The convertible interest rate cap was purchased at a $250,000 premium, has a cap on the floating rate index of 3%, has a notional amount of $10,000,000 and matures on November 1, 2007.  It effectively caps the floating rate index at 3%, so the maximum interest rate to be paid on $10,000,000 of debt financing is 3% plus remarketing, credit enhancement, liquidity and trustee fees which aggregate to approximately 90 basis points.  If the floating rate index declines to a level where Bank of America elects to exercise its option, the convertible cap is converted to a fixed rate swap and the Partnership's interest expense is converted to a fixed rate of 2.6% plus remarketing, credit enhancement, liquidity and trustee fees which aggregate to approximately 90 basis points for the remaining term of the agreement.  The convertible interest rate cap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge of the variable-rate debt financing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On February 1, 2003, the Partnership purchased a convertible
  interest rate cap from Bank of America. The convertible interest rate cap was
  purchased at a $608,000 premium, has a cap on the floating rate index of 3.5%,
  has a notional amount of $15,000,000 and matures on January 1, 2010. It effectively
  caps the floating rate index at 3.5%, so the maximum interest rate to be paid
  on $15,000,000 of debt financing is 3.5% plus remarketing, credit enhancement,
  liquidity and trustee fees which aggregate to approximately 90 basis points.
  If the floating rate index declines to a level where Bank of America elects
  to exercise its option, the convertible cap is converted to a fixed rate swap
  and the Partnership's interest expense is converted to a fixed rate of 2.95%
  plus remarketing, credit enhancement, liquidity and trustee fees which aggregate
  to approximately 90 basis points for the remaining term of the agreement. The
  convertible interest rate cap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge of the variable-rate
  debt financing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Partnership accounts for its interest rate cap agreements in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133 &quot;Accounting for Derivatives&quot;.  At the inception, the Partnership designated the interest rate cap agreements as cash flow hedges of floating rate debt financing. The hedges are considered highly effective at inception as the critical terms of the caps and the floating rate debt financing are substantially the same.  The calculation of effectiveness is made when the floating rate (the BMA Municipal Index) is greater than the strike rate of the caps and will exclude the effect of changes in the fair value of the cap.  The fair value of the caps at inception are their cost, which is all attributable to its time value as the strike rates of the caps are greater than the current floating rate.  Changes in the time value, or fair value, of the caps will be marked to market with the difference recognized in earnings over the term of the caps.  Interest rate cap expense was $69,458 for the year ended December 31, 2002, and is included as a component of interest expense in the accompanying financial statements.  </P>
<B>
<P>11.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments<BR>
</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following methods and assumptions were used by the Partnership in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments:</P>
<DIR>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cash and cash equivalents, interest receivable, accounts
    payable and accrued expenses, distributions payable and debt financing: Due
    to their short-term nature, fair value approximates the carrying value of
    such assets and liabilities.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and investment
    in other tax-exempt bonds: Fair value is based on the Partnership's estimate
    of fair value as described in Note 2(B). </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Investment in taxable loans: Fair value is based upon the
    discounted future cash flows to service the loans and approximated carrying
    value at December 31, 2002.</P>
</DIR>


<B><P>12.  Commitment</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In September 2002, the Partnership entered into a plan to acquire an interest in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by Fairmont Oaks Apartments in Gainsville, Florida, which total $8,020,000.  In connection with this acquisition, the Partnership pledged $5,950,000 of Primary Trust Certificates related to its Northwoods Lake Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Partnership has loaned $1,042,414 to the owners
  of Fairmont Oaks Apartments in the form of a taxable loan, bearing interest
  at 6.5%. The purpose of the taxable loan is to facilitate the Partnership's
  acquisition of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by Fairmont Oaks
  Apartments. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Audit Committee of America First Companies L.L.C. ("America First"), which is the general partner of the general partner of America First Tax Exempt Investment Partners, L.P. (the &quot;Partnership&quot;), is currently comprised of Martin A. Massengale, Mariann Byerwalter, and Clayton K. Yeutter, each of whom is an independent manager of America First.  The Audit Committee operates under a written charter. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The Partnership's management, which consists of the Partnership's general partner and America First, is responsible for the preparation of the Partnership's financial statements and for maintaining an adequate system of internal controls and processes for that purpose.  KPMG LLP ("KPMG") acts as the Partnership's independent auditors and they are responsible for conducting an independent audit of the Partnership's annual financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and issuing a report on the results of their audit.  The Audit Committee is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of both of these processes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002 with management of the Partnership and with representatives of KPMG.  As a result of these discussions, the Audit Committee believes that America First maintains an effective system of accounting controls that allow it to prepare financial statements that fairly present the Partnership's financial position and results of its operations.  Discussions with KPMG also included the matters required by Statement on Auditing Standard No. 61 (Communications with Audit Committees).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the independence of KPMG.  We received written disclosures and a letter from KPMG regarding its independence as required by Independent Standards Board Standards No. 1 and discussed this information with KPMG.</P>
<P><BR>
Based on the foregoing, the Audit Committee has recommended that the audited financial statements of the Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2002 be included in the Partnership's annual report on Form 10-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</P>
