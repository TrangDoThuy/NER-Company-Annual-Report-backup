                                    PART I

    Item 1.  Business.  America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. (the
Registrant or the Partnership) was formed on April 2, 1998 under the Delaware
Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding,
operating, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of federally
tax-exempt mortgage bonds which have been issued to provide construction
and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.  The
Registrant's business objectives are to: (i) preserve and protect its capital;
(ii) provide regular cash distributions to investors; and, (iii) provide a
potential for an enhanced federally tax-exempt yield as a result of a
participation interest in the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of
the real estate financed by the tax-exempt mortgage bonds held by the
Registrant.  The General Partner of the Registrant is America First Capital
Associates Limited Partnership Two ("AFCA 2").

     On February 1, 1999, the Partnership merged with America First Tax Exempt
Mortgage Fund Limited Partnership (the Prior Partnership).  Under the terms of
the merger agreement, the Partnership was the surviving partnership and
effectively took over the operations of the Prior Partnership. The Partnership
had no operations or activities prior to its merger with the Prior Partnership
and was formed, accordingly, for that sole purpose.  The separate existence of
the Prior Partnership terminated on that date.  The Partnership assumed all
the assets and liabilities of the Prior Partnership.  Each BUC holder of the
Prior Partnership received one BUC of the Partnership as such BUC holder held
in the Prior Partnership.  The General Partner of the Prior Partnership was
AFCA 2 and, accordingly, the Merger did not result in a change in control.
The Partnership has additional authority to reconfigure its assets and sell
interests therein, to issue additional BUCs and to invest the proceeds of such
asset sales and BUC issuances in additional tax-exempt bonds secured by
multifamily housing properties.

     At December 31, 2000, the Partnership continued to hold six of the seven
tax-exempt mortgage bonds originally held by the Prior Partnership.  The
seventh tax-exempt mortgage bond was sold in September 2000.  In addition,
pursuant to its business strategy described below, the Partnership acquired
three tax-exempt mortgage bonds during 2000.  The carrying value (at estimated
fair value) of the nine tax-exempt mortgage bonds was $110,500,000 at December
31, 2000.  The tax-exempt mortgage bonds were issued by various state and
local housing authorities to provide for the construction and/or permanent
financing of nine multifamily housing properties located in six states. Under
the terms of the mortgage bonds, the principal amounts of eight of the bonds
do not amortize over their terms.  The mortgage bonds provide for the payment
of base interest to the Partnership and for the payment of contingent interest
based upon net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real
estate properties.  Therefore, the return to the Partnership depends upon the
economic performance of the real estate which collateralizes the mortgage
bonds.  For this reason, the Partnership's investments are dependent on the
economic performance of such real estate and may be considered to be in
competition with other income-producing real estate of the same type in the
same geographic areas.  A description of the nine tax-exempt mortgage bonds
(and the properties collateralizing such bonds) held by the Registrant at
December 31, 2000, appears in Note 5 of the Notes to Financial Statements
filed in response to Item 8 hereof.

     The Partnership is pursuing a business strategy of increasing the number
of tax-exempt multifamily mortgage bonds held by it in order to: (i) increase
the amount of tax-exempt interest available for distribution to its investors,
(ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and (iii) achieve economies of
scale.  Unlike the Prior Partnership, the Registrant has the ability to
finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds through the
issuance of additional Beneficial Unit Certificates (BUCs) representing
assigned limited partnership interests and from the sale of senior debt
instruments created from its existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage bonds.
In general, tax-exempt mortgage bonds acquired by the Partnership will be
secured by a first mortgage or deed of trust on multifamily real estate.
Unlike the Prior Partnership, the Partnership also has the authority  to
acquire tax-exempt bonds that represent less than 100% of the bonds secured by
a particular multifamily property.  The Partnership may also acquire other
types of tax-exempt securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
Such tax-exempt securities must be rated in one of the highest four rating
categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency.
Such bonds may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the
time of acquisition.  In addition, the Partnership may also acquire bonds or
other investments secured by multifamily real estate which generate interest

                                      -1-

that is not exempt from federal income tax.  However, such bonds may only be
acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of tax-exempt mortgage bonds
secured by the same property.

     In keeping with its investment strategy, the Partnership acquired three
tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by multifamily housing properties during
2000 as discussed above.  Such acquisitions totaled $44,285,000 and were
securitized under three separate financing transactions.  In addition, the
Partnership also acquired $3,000,000 in tax-exempt bonds that are not secured
by a multifamily housing property but are guaranteed by an affiliate of the
borrower of such funds.

     The amount of cash received by the Partnership from tax-exempt mortgage
bonds is a function of the net rental revenues generated by the properties
collateralizing the tax-exempt mortgage bonds owned by the Partnership.  Net
rental revenues from a multifamily apartment complex depend on the rental and
occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses.
Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand
for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.  This, in
turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic
conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on
single-family mortgage loans.  In addition, factors such as government
regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes,
labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a
property.

     In each city in which the properties collateralized by the tax-exempt
mortgage bonds owned by the Partnership are located, such properties compete
with a substantial number of other apartment complexes.  Apartment complexes
also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by
potential tenants.  The principal method of competition is to offer
competitive rental rates.  Such properties also compete by emphasizing
property location, condition and amenities.

     The Partnership believes that each of the properties collateralizing its
tax-exempt mortgage bonds owned is in compliance in all material respects with
federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other
environmental matters and the Partnership is not aware of any environmental
contamination at any of such properties that would require any material
capital expenditure by the Partnership for the remediation thereof.

     The Partnership has no employees.  Certain services are provided to the
Partnership by employees of America First Companies L.L.C. which is the general
partner of the general partner of the Partnership, and the Partnership
reimburses America First Companies L.L.C. for such services at cost.  The
Partnership is not charged, and does not reimburse, for the services performed
by managers and officers of America First Companies L.L.C..

     Item 2.  Properties.  The Partnership does not own or lease any physical
properties.

     Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.  There are no material pending legal
proceedings to which the Partnership is a party or to which any of the property
collateralizing the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage bonds is subject.

     Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.  No matter
was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000, to a vote of the Partnership's security holders.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

On February 1, 1999, America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. (the New
Partnership) commenced operations when it merged with America First Tax Exempt
Mortgage Fund Limited Partnership (the Prior Partnership).  The General
Partner of both the Prior Partnership and the New Partnership is America First
Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two (AFCA 2).  The New Partnership and
the Prior Partnership are collectively referred to as the Partnership.

The Partnership's primary capital resource consists of nine tax-exempt
mortgage bonds which were issued to the Partnership in order to provide
construction and/or permanent financing for nine multifamily housing
projects.  The Partnership had an investment in a tenth tax-exempt mortgage
bond which was collateralized by the Arama Apartments, a 293-unit property
located in Miami, Florida which it sold on September 11, 2000.  The nine
multifamily projects collateralizing the tax-exempt mortgage bonds held by the
Partnership at December 31, 2000 are listed in the following table:

The aggregate carrying value of the tax-exempt mortgage bonds at December 31,
2000 was $110,500,000.  The carrying value of the bonds reflects the general
partner's estimate of the fair value of such bonds.  The Partnership has
securitized $49,255,000 of its tax-exempt mortgage bonds as described herein.

Each of the tax-exempt mortgage bonds bears interest at a fixed rate and
provides for the payment of additional contingent interest that is payable
solely from available net cash flow generated by the financed property.  The
principal amounts of eight of the bonds do not amortize over their respective
terms.

Tax-exempt interest earned on the mortgage bonds represents the Partnership's
principal source of cash flow.  The Partnership also earns tax-exempt and
taxable interest on certain other investments.  The Partnership's principal
uses of cash are the payment of operating expenses and distributions to BUC
holders.  The following table sets forth information relating to cash
distributions paid to BUC holders for the years shown:

</TABLE>

In addition to cash generated from interest income, the Partnership may also
draw on its reserves to pay operating expenses and to supplement cash
distributions.  As of December 31, 2000, the amount held by the Partnership in
the reserves equaled $5,751,825.  During the year ended December 31, 2000, a
total of $258,786 of undistributed income was withdrawn from the reserves.
Future distributions to BUC Holders will depend upon the amount of base and
contingent interest received on the mortgage bonds, the size of reserve
established by the Partnership and the extent to which withdrawals are made
from the reserve.

The Partnership believes that the cash provided by interest income from its
tax-exempt mortgage bonds and other investments, supplemented, if necessary,
by withdrawals from its reserve, will be adequate to meet its projected
short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including the payments of
expenses and distributions to BUC holders.

The Partnership is pursuing an investment strategy whereby it is investing in
additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds and related investments and financing
such acquisitions through the sale of senior interests in its existing
tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  The Partnership may also finance such acquisitions
through the issuance of additional BUCs.  By acquiring additional investments,
AFCA 2 hopes to (i) increase the amount of tax-exempt interest available for
distribution to BUC holders, (ii) reduce risk through increased asset
diversification and (iii) achieve improved economies of scale.  By financing
the acquisition of additional investments through the sale of senior interests
in its existing tax-exempt mortgage bonds, the Partnership will forego a
portion of the interest it currently earns on its existing tax-exempt mortgage
bonds, but expects to reinvest the sale proceeds in instruments which generate
a greater amount of interest income.  To the extent the Partnership sells such
senior interests and is unable to reinvest the proceeds in investments that
generate interest at least as great as the interest paid on the senior
interests, the amount of interest income available to the Partnership will
decline.  AFCA 2 is unable to estimate the amount of additional tax-exempt
mortgage bonds and other investments that the Partnership may acquire, if any,
and there can be no assurance that the Partnership will be able to achieve any
of the goals stated above.


                                      -5-

In keeping with its investment strategy, the Partnership acquired $44,285,000
of tax-exempt mortgage bonds during 2000.  These acquisitions include
$17,155,000 of tax-exempt mortgage bonds (the Iona Bonds) secured by Iona
Lakes Apartments located in Ft. Myers, Florida, which were acquired on March
28, 2000,  $16,000,000 of tax-exempt mortgage bonds (the Clear Lake Colony
Bonds) secured by Clear Lake Colony Apartments located in West Palm Beach,
Florida, which were acquired on June 8, 2000, and $11,130,000 of tax-exempt
mortgage bonds (the Bent Tree Bonds) secured by Bent Tree Apartments, located
in Columbia, South Carolina, which were acquired on December 21, 2000.  The
Partnership securitized each such bonds under three separate financing
transactions by depositing them with a custodian which issued (i) certificates
to a Merrill Lynch affiliate evidencing a beneficial ownership interest in all
outstanding principal and base interest on the bonds and, in the case of the
Iona bonds (ii) a residual certificate to the Partnership evidencing a
beneficial ownership interest in all contingent interest on such bonds.  With
respect to the Clear Lake Colony Bonds and the Bent Tree Bonds, the
Partnership owns a separate series of bonds entitling it to contingent
interest thereon.  The Merrill Lynch affiliate then transferred its
certificates to trusts, which, in turn, sold to institutional investors
floating rate senior securities credit enhanced by the Merrill Lynch
affiliate.  The trusts also issued to the Partnership residual interests in
the trusts with a total face amount of $15,000 ($5,000 for each of the
securitized bonds) for a total purchase price of $15,000 ($5,000 each). The
Partnership has a call right on the senior floating rate securities and, upon
exercise of such right, may collapse the trusts and, therefore, retains a
level of control over such securities.  The purchase price of the senior
securities is equal to the par amount plus 10% of any increase in the market
value of the underlying bonds.  As described in Note 2E) to the financial
statements, these arrangements have been accounted for as financing
transactions and, in effect, provide variable-rate financing to the
Partnership.

As a result of the securitizations described above and one securitization
completed during 1999, the Partnership has securitized $49,255,000 of its
tax-exempt mortgage bond portfolio as of December 31, 2000.  As of December
31, 2000, the Partnership has pledged a total of $87,831,000 of its tax-exempt
mortgage bond portfolio in connection with its securitizations.

On September 11, 2000, the Partnership sold its investment in the Arama
Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bond to the obligor of such tax-exempt mortgage
bond for $7,000,000.  The Partnership has reinvested the proceeds from the
sale pursuant to its investment strategy.

In addition to the acquisition of the tax-exempt mortgage bonds discussed
above, the Partnership acquired $3,000,000 in tax-exempt bonds which are not
secured by a multifamily property but are guaranteed by an affiliate of the
borrower of such funds.

In connection with the Partnership's plan to repurchase up to $1,000,000 of
the Partnership's BUCs, the Partnership purchased and cancelled 141,200 BUCs
in open market transactions at a cost of $755,929 during the year ended
December 31, 2000.


Asset Quality

It is the policy of the Partnership to make a periodic review of the real
estate collateralizing the Partnership's mortgage bonds in order to assess for
impairment the carrying value of the tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  The sole
source of funds available for the repayment of principal of the bonds is the
net proceeds from the sale or refinancing of the financed properties, except
for one tax-exempt mortgage bond which requires semiannual payments of
principal and interest out of operating cash flow.












                                      -6-

Based on the foregoing methodology, during the quarter ended June 30, 2000,
the Partnership determined it was not likely to recover or receive its
contracted cash flows (including the repayment of principal) on its investment
in the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bond based on a commitment by the
Partnership to the obligor of such tax-exempt mortgage bond.  Accordingly, the
Partnership realized a loss of $1,100,000 during such quarter and the carrying
value of the tax-exempt mortgage bond of $8,100,000 was written down to its
fair value of $7,000,000 as the new carrying value.  The Partnership sold its
investment in the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bond on September 11,
2000, as discussed above.

Based on reviews performed during 2000 on the real estate collateralizing the
Partnership's other mortgage bonds, no indications of impairment of the
tax-exempt mortgage bonds were noted.

</TABLE>

Mortgage bond investment income increased $1,225,470 (21%) from 1999 to 2000.
Approximately $1,536,000 of such increase is attributable to the acquisitions
of the Iona Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake Colony Apartments and Bent Tree
Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bonds in March, June and December 2000,
respectively.  In addition, the Partnership earned approximately $133,000 and
$86,000 more on the Ashley Square and Northwoods Lake Apartments tax-exempt
mortgage bonds, respectively, during 2000, compared to 1999.  Offsetting such
additions to income were decreases of approximately $424,000, $46,000, $39,000

                                     -7-

and $21,000 in mortgage bond investment income from Arama Apartments,
Woodbridge Apartments of Bloomington III, Shoals Crossing, and Woodbridge
Apartments of Louisville II.  Such increases and decreases are more fully
described below.

The Ashley Square mortgage bond, despite not being serviced with the full
amount of base interest due during 2000 or 1999, was able to provide the
Partnership with $133,000 more base interest in 2000 compared to 1999.  Such
increase resulted from an increase in net cash flow generated by the
underlying property as operating expenses, primarily property improvements and
real estate taxes, were lower in 2000 compared to 1999 and operating revenue
was higher in 2000 than in 1999.

The $86,000 increase in income earned on the Northwoods Lake mortgage bond and
the $46,000 and $21,000 decreases in interest earned on the Woodbridge
Apartments of Bloomington III and Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II
mortgage bonds, respectively, are attributable to variations in the amount of
past due base interest received on such mortgage bonds that was due to the
Partnership prior to their reissuances in 1998.  Such variations are a function
of the net cash flow generated by the respective underlying property.  Despite
such variations in net cash flow, the Partnership earned the full amount of
base interest due on each of these mortgage bonds during 2000 and 1999.

The decrease of $424,000 related to Arama Apartments resulted from the
nonperformance of such bond beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2000,
and the sale of the bond on September 11, 2000.  The decrease of $39,000 in
income earned on the Shoals Crossing mortgage bond is reflective of the
decrease in net cash flow generated by the underlying property.  Shoals
Crossing was unable to fully service the base interest due in either 2000 or
1999.

Mortgage bond investment income earned in 1999 approximated that of 1998.
However, mortgage bond investment income on the tax-exempt mortgage bonds
secured by Shoals Crossing, Northwoods Lake Apartments and Woodbridge
Apartments of Bloomington III increased by approximately $144,000, $85,000 and
9,000, respectively, from 1998 to 1999.  These increases were offset by
decreases of approximately $106,000, $88,000 and $44,000 in mortgage bond
investment income from Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II, Ashley Square
and Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest.  Such increases and decreases are more fully
described below.

Although the base interest on the Shoals Crossing mortgage bond was not fully
serviced in 1999 or 1998, the Partnership earned $144,000 more in interest
during 1999 than in 1998.  Such increase resulted from an increase in net cash
flow generated by the underlying property as operating revenue was higher and
certain operating expenses were lower in 1999 compared to 1998.  In addition,
certain deferred maintenance costs were paid in 1998 which reduced the
property's cash flow available to pay base interest on the mortgage bond for
such year.

The increases of $85,000 and $9,000 in mortgage bond investment income earned
on the Northwoods Lake and Woodbridge Apartments of Bloomington III mortgage
bonds, respectively, is attributable to the receipt of past due base interest
that was due to the Partnership prior to their reissuances in 1998.  The
Partnership earned the full amount of base interest due on each of these
mortgage bonds in 1999 whereas neither property generated the full amount of
base interest due in 1998.

The mortgage loans secured by Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II and
Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest generated $106,000 and $44,000, respectively,
less mortgage bond investment income due primarily to the reduction of the
base interest rate from 8.5% to 7.5% and 8.5% to 7%, respectively, during
1998.  The decrease for Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II, however, was
partially offset by the receipt in 1999 of past due base interest due to the
Partnership on such mortgage bond prior to the reissuance referred to above.
The Partnership earned the full amount of base interest due on each of these
mortgage bonds during 1999 but earned less that the full amount of base
interest in 1998.  Ashley Square generated $88,000 less mortgage bond
investment income due to significant property improvements made during 1999,
including roof replacements and painting of the property exteriors.  The
Partnership did not earn the full amount of base interest due on such bond
during either 1999 or 2000.



                                     -8-

The Partnership earned $21,312 of bond investment income on an investment in
$3,000,000 of tax-exempt bonds acquired in November 2000.  No such income was
earned in 1999 or 1998 as the Partnership did not have similar investments in
such years.

The increase of $339,406 in other interest income from 1999 to 2000 is
primarily attributable to an increase in the Partnership's other
interest-earning assets.  Also contributing slightly to the increase was the
investment of $5,000,000 in proceeds received in conjunction with the debt
financing obtained in August 1999 and $7,000,000 in cash proceeds from the
September 2000 sale of the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bond.

The increase in other interest income of $68,972 from 1998 to 1999 is
primarily attributable to the investment in interest-earning assets of
$5,000,000 in proceeds received in conjunction with the debt financing
obtained in August 1999.

Contingent interest income decreased $98,497 from 1999 to 2000. The
Partnership earned contingent interest income of $75,795 and $22,702 from the
Arama Apartments and Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest tax-exempt mortgage bonds,
in 1999.  No such income was earned from either bond for the comparable period
of 2000.  Such decrease resulted from a reduction in net operating income
generated by the respective underlying properties and the sale of the Arama
Apartments bond on September 11, 2000.

Contingent interest income decreased $23,602 from 1998 to 1999.  This is the
result of a $46,000 decrease in contingent interest received from the mortgage
bond on Arama Apartments which was partially offset by the receipt of $22,000
of contingent interest from the mortgage bond on Ashley Pointe at Eagle
Crest.  The decrease in contingent interest generated by Arama Apartments was
due to a decrease in net cash flow generated by Arama Apartments during the
contingent interest period. The Partnership did not earn contingent interest
on the Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest mortgage bond in 1998.  During October
1998, this tax-exempt mortgage bond was reissued with a lower base rate of
interest.  This allowed the property to generate contingent interest on the
reissued bond in 1999.  However, the overall tax-exempt interest earned by the
Partnership on the Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest mortgage bond decreased by
approximately $22,000 from 1998 to 1999 due primarily to a decrease in net
cash flow generated by the property.

During 2000, the Partnership realized a loss of $1,100,000 in its tax-exempt
mortgage bond secured by Arama Apartments as management determined it was not
likely to recover or receive its contracted cash flows (including repayment of
principal) on such investment.  Similarly, during 1998, the Partnership
realized a loss of $4,000,000 on the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage
bond.  No such losses were recorded in 1999.

During 2000, the Partnership incurred interest expense of $1,442,685 on the
$49,285,000 of debt financing obtained in connection with securitizing certain
of its tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  During 1999, the Partnership incurred
interest expense of $87,715 on the $5,000,000 of debt financing obtained in
August 1999.  Accordingly, interest expense increased $1,354,970 from 1999 to
2000.  The Partnership did not have debt financing during 1998 and, therefore,
did not incur interest expense during such year.

General and administrative expenses increased $93,000 (11%) from 1999 to 2000
due to: (i) an increase of approximately $83,000 in salaries and related
expenses, (ii) increase of approximately $40,000 in servicing fees, partially
offset by (iii) a decrease of $21,000 in costs incurred in conjunction with
the Merger and (iv) a net decrease of $9,000 in other general and
administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses decreased $143,412 (14%) from 1998 to
1999.  Approximately $224,000 of such decrease was the result of costs
incurred in 1998 in conjunction with the Merger.  Offsetting such decrease was
an increase of approximately $81,000 in overall general and administrative
expenses.

Forward Looking Statements

This report contains forward looking statements that reflect management's
current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry
conditions, the Partnership's performance and financial results.  All
statements, trend analysis and other information concerning possible or
assumed future results of operations of the Partnership and the real estate
investments it has made (including, but not limited to, the information
contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations"), constitute forward-looking statements.  BUC holders
and others should understand that these forward looking statements are subject
to numerous risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could affect the
future results of the Partnership and could cause those results to differ
materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements contained
herein.

     Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
The Partnership's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.  The
Partnership's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to its investments in tax-exempt bonds and its financing debt.  The
Partnership does enter into derivative instrument transactions for speculative
purposes.

The aggregate fair value of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage bonds and
other tax-exempt bonds was $110,500,000 and $3,000,000, respectively, at
December 31, 2000.  The tax-exempt bonds have fixed interest rates.  The
principal amount of the tax-exempt bonds does not amortize over its terms,
except for one tax-exempt mortgage bond which requires semiannual payments of
principal and interest out of operating cash flow.  The weighted average
interest rate of tax-exempt mortgage bonds, the vast majority of which mature
beyond 2005, was 7.3% at December 31, 2000.

During 2000, the Partnership significantly increased its financing debt in
conjunction with the acquisitions of three tax-exempt mortgage bonds totaling
$44,285,000.  Such acquisitions were effectively financed with variable-rate
debt as more fully described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  At
December 31, 2000, the Partnership had total debt financing with a principal
amount of and fair value of $49,255,000.  The weighted average interest rate
of the variable-rate financing was 5.18%, including fees, at December 31, 2000.

The stated maturity dates of the debt financing are as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Stated Maturity Date          Amount
--------------------    ------------
<S>                     <C>
2001		                  $     90,000
2002                      11,225,000
2002                      16,100,000
2004                      16,840,000
2011                       5,000,000

In the event of an unfavorable change in interest rates, the Partnership may
collapse each of the financing transactions.
</TABLE>

As the above information incorporates only those positions or exposures that
existed as of December 31, 2000, it does not consider those exposures or
positions that could arise after that date.  The Partnership's ultimate
economic impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the
exposures that arise during the period, the Partnership's risk mitigating
strategies at that time and interest rates.

     Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  The Financial
Statements of the Registrant are set forth in Item 14 hereof and are
incorporated herein by reference.

     Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure.  There were no disagreements with the Registrant's
independent accountants on accounting principles and practices or financial
disclosure during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.
Section 16(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 requires the managers
and executive officers of the general partner of the Registrant's general
partner and persons who own more than 10% of the Registrant's BUCs to file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") reports of their
ownership of the Registrant's BUCs.  Such officers, managers and BUC holders
are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Registrant with copies of all
Section 16(a) reports they file.  Based solely upon review of the copies of
such reports received by the Registrant and written representations from each
such person who did not file an annual report with the SEC (Form 5) that no
other reports were required, the Registrant believes that there was compliance
for the year ended December 31, 2000 with all Section 16(a) filing
requirements applicable to such executive officers, managers and beneficial
owners of BUCs.

     Item 11.  Executive Compensation.  Neither the Registrant nor AFCA 2 has
any managers or officers.  Certain services are provided to the Registrant by
managers and officers of America First Companies, L.L.C. (the general partner
of AFCA 2).  None of the managers or executive officers of America First
Companies L.L.C. receive compensation from the Registrant and AFCA 2 receives
no reimbursement from the Registrant for any portion of their salaries.
Remuneration paid by the Registrant to the Registrant's general partner
pursuant to the terms of its limited partnership agreement during the year
ended December 31, 2000 is described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial
Statements filed in response to Item 8 hereof.

     Item 12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.

          (a)  No person is known by the Registrant to own beneficially more
than 5% of the Registrant's BUCs.

          (b)  Lisa Yanney Roskens owns 9,500 BUCs.  No other manager or
officer of America First Companies L.L.C. and no partner of AFCA 2 owns any
BUCs.

          (c)  There are no arrangements known to the Registrant the
operation of which may, at any subsequent date, result in a change in control
of the Registrant.

     Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.  The general
partner of the Registrant is AFCA 2 and the sole general partner of AFCA 2 is
America First Companies L.L.C..





                                     -12-

     Except as described herein, the Registrant is not a party to any
transaction or proposed transaction with AFCA 2 , America First Companies
L.L.C. or with any person who is: (i) a manager or executive officer of
America First Companies L.L.C. or any general partner of AFCA 2; (ii) a
nominee for election as a manager of America First Companies L.L.C.; (iii) an
owner of more than 5% of the BUCs; or, (iv) a member of the immediate family
of any of the foregoing persons.

     During 2000, the Registrant paid or reimbursed AFCA 2 or America First
Companies L.L.C. $1,042,172 for certain costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the operation of the Registrant, including legal and
accounting fees, investor communication costs, such as printing and mailing
charges, and certain costs capitalized by the Partnership.  See Note 7 to
Notes to Financial Statements filed in response to Item 8 hereof for a
description of these costs and expenses.

     AFCA 2 received administrative fees of $369,548 in 2000.  These
administrative fees are paid by the owners of the properties financed by the
tax-exempt mortgage bonds held by the Partnership out of the net cash flow
generated by the properties prior to the payment of contingent interest on
such bonds.  Since these fees are not Partnership expenses, they have not been
reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

     AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee from the Partnership in the
event the Partnership acquires additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds or other
mortgage investments and is not able to negotiate the payment of these fees by
the property owners or in the event it acquires title to any of the properties
securing its existing tax-exempt mortgage bonds by reason of foreclosure.
AFCA 2 received administrative fees of $1,425 from the Partnership for the
year ended December 31, 2000.

     AFCA 2 earned mortgage placement fees of $442,850 in 2000, in connection
with the acquisitions of the Iona Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake Colony
Apartments, and Bent Tree Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  The mortgage
placement fees were paid by the owners of the respective apartment
properties.  Since such fees are not expenses of the Partnership, they have
not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

     America First Properties Management Company, L.L.C. (the "Manager"), an
affiliate of AFCA 2, was retained to provide property management services with
respect to the day-to-day operation of Ashley Square, Northwoods Lake
Apartments, Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest, Shoals Crossing, Iona Lakes
Apartments (beginning in April 2000), Clear Lake Colony Apartments (beginning
in June 2000) and Bent Tree Apartments (beginning in December 2000).  The
property management agreements provide that the Manager is entitled to receive
a management fee equal to a stated percentage of the gross revenues generated
by the property under management.  Management fees payable to the Manager
range from 4% to 4.5% of gross revenues.  The management fees paid to the
Manager reflect market rates for such services in the areas in which these
properties are located.  During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Manager
received property management fees of $478,179.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Partners
America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of America First Tax Exempt
Investors, L.P. (formerly America First Tax Exempt Mortgage Fund Limited
Partnership) as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related statements of
income and comprehensive income, partners' capital and cash flows for the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000.  These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Partnership's management.  Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of America First Tax Exempt
Investors, L.P. (formerly America First Tax Exempt Mortgage Fund Limited
Partnership) as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing activity:

During 1999 and 1998, two and four, respectively, of the Partnership's
tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by multifamily properties were refinanced by
their respective state and local housing finance authorities.  In each case,
the existing tax-exempt mortgage bond held by the Partnership was terminated
and a new bond in the same principal amount was issued to the Partnership.
The total amount refinanced was $11,000,000 in 1999 and $53,526,000 in 1998.

Supplemental disclosure of non-cash financing activities:

As more fully described in Notes 2E), 5(9), (10) and (11), on March 28, 2000,
June 1, 2000 and December 21, 2000, the Partnership securitized $17,155,000,
$16,000,000 and $11,130,000, respectively, of tax-exempt mortgage bonds on
Iona Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake Colony Apartments and Bent Tree Apartments,
respectively, by depositing such bonds with a custodian.  The bonds were
credit enhanced and interests in substantially all of such bonds were sold to
institutional investors with the Partnership acquiring residual interests
therein.  These arrangements have been accounted for as financing transactions.

In connection with the February 1, 1999, merger of the Partnership and America
First Tax Exempt Mortgage Fund Limited Partnership (the Prior Partnership)
described in Note 1 to the financial statements, unit holders of the Prior
Partnership received one Beneficial Unit Certificate (BUC) of the Partnership
for each BUC they held in the Prior Partnership as of the record date.

activities prior to its merger with the Prior Partnership and was formed,
accordingly, for that sole purpose.  Under the terms of the merger agreement,
the New Partnership was the surviving partnership and effectively took over
the operations of the Prior Partnership as of that date.   Unit holders of the
Prior Partnership received one Beneficial Unit Certificate (BUC) of the New
Partnership for each BUC they held in the Prior Partnership as of the record
date.  The Prior Partnership was terminated under the provisions of the Prior
Partnership's Partnership Agreement.  The New Partnership will terminate on
December 31, 2050, unless terminated earlier under the provisions of its
Partnership Agreement.  The general partner of both the Prior Partnership and
the New Partnership is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership
Two (AFCA 2).  The New Partnership and the Prior Partnership are collectively
referred to as the Partnership.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  A)Financial Statement Presentation
    The accompanying 2000 financial statements include the accounts of the New
    Partnership.  The accompanying 1999 financial statements include the
    combined accounts of the New Partnership from February 1, 1999 (the Merger
    Date), through December 31, 1999, and the accounts of the Prior Partnership
    from January 1, 1999 until the Merger Date.  The combination of the
    accounts of the Prior Partnership and the New Partnership is reflected on
    an "as-if" pooling basis for a merger of entities under common control.
    Financial statements for 1998 include the accounts of the Prior
    Partnership.

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
    accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

  B)Investment in Tax-Exempt Mortgage Bonds and Other Tax-Exempt Bonds
    Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-
    sale or trading.  Investments classified as available-for-sale are reported
    at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings
    and reflected in other comprehensive income.  Subsequent increases and
    decreases in the net unrealized gain/loss on available-for-sale securities
    are reflected as adjustments to the carrying value of the portfolio and in
    other comprehensive income.  The Partnership does not have investment
    securities classified as held-to-maturity or trading.

    The carrying value of the tax-exempt mortgage bonds and other tax-exempt
    bonds reflects the general partner's estimate of the fair value of such
    bonds.  The carrying value of the tax-exempt mortgage bonds is periodically
    reviewed and adjustments are made when there are significant changes in the
    estimated fair value of the underlying collateral for the tax-exempt
    mortgage bonds.

    Mortgage bond investment income and other bond investment income is
    recognized as earned.

 C)Income Taxes
    No provision has been made for income taxes since the Beneficial Unit
    Certificate (BUC) Holders are required to report their share of the
    Partnership's taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes.
    The tax basis of the Partnership's assets and liabilities exceeded the
    reported amounts by $373,478 and $4,905,987 at December 31, 2000 and
    1999, respectively.

  D)Cash Equivalents
    Cash equivalents include investments in federally tax-exempt securities
    with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased.

  E)Debt Financing
    During 1999 and 2000, the Partnership securitized $49,285,000 (of which
    $49,255,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2000) of its tax-exempt mortgage
    bond portfolio under four separate financing transactions as described
    below.

				The Partnership securitized $5,000,000 of its tax-exempt mortgage bonds
    during August 1999.  In connection with the securitization, the Partnership
    deposited $25,250,000 of such tax-exempt mortgage bonds into a trust (the
    Primary Trust) which issued $25,250,000 in trust certificates (the Primary
    Trust Certificates).  The Primary Trust issued and delivered to a Merrill
    Lynch affiliate $5,000,000 in Primary Trust Certificates which have a first
    priority claim on principal and base interest on the underlying tax-exempt
    mortgage bonds. The $5,000,000 in Primary Trust Certificates were placed in
    a secondary trust (the Secondary Trust) and credit enhanced by a Merrill
    Lynch affiliate.  The Merrill Lynch affiliate sold to institutional
    investors floating rate securities (the Secondary Securities) in the amount
    of $4,995,000.  The Partnership also pledged and transferred an additional
    $3,000,000 of Primary Trust Certificates to a Merrill Lynch affiliate to
    secure payment of the $5,000,000 principal amount of and accrued interest
    on the aforementioned Primary Trust Certificates.  The Partnership obtained
    ownership of the remaining Primary Trust Certificates in the principal
    amount of $17,250,000 and the rights to all subordinate interest paid on
    the related tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  The Partnership also acquired a
    residual interest in the Secondary Trust with a face amount of $5,000 and
    proceeds of the transfer of the Primary Trust Certificates to the Merrill
    Lynch affiliate in the amount of $4,995,000.  The Partnership has a call
    right on the Secondary Securities and upon exercise of such right may
    collapse the Secondary and Primary Trusts and, therefore, retains a level
    of control over the Secondary Securities.  The purchase price of the
    Secondary Securities is equal to the par amount plus 10% of any increase in
    the market price of the underlying Primary Trust Certificates.  (Also see
    Note 5 (8)).

    The Partnership also securitized tax-exempt mortgage bonds of $17,155,000
    on Iona Lakes Apartments which were acquired by the Partnership on March
    28, 2000.  Similar to the $5,000,000 securitization described above, the
    $17,155,000 of tax-exempt mortgage bonds (the Iona Bonds) were deposited
    with a custodian pursuant to a custody and participation agreement (the
    Custody Agreement).  The custodian issued (i) a certificate to a Merrill
    Lynch affiliate evidencing a beneficial ownership interest in all
    outstanding principal and base interest on the Iona Bonds (the Senior
    Certificate) and (ii) a certificate to the Partnership evidencing a
    beneficial ownership interest in all contingent interest on the Iona Bonds
    (the Residual Certificate).  The Merrill Lynch affiliate then transferred
    the Senior Certificate to a secondary trust (Secondary Trust) and credit
    enhanced such Senior Certificate.  The Merrill Lynch affiliate sold to
    institutional investors floating rate securities (the Secondary Securities)
    in the amount of $17,150,000.  In addition to the Residual Certificate, the
    Partnership acquired for $5,000 a residual interest in the Secondary Trust
    with a face amount of $5,000.  The Partnership has a call right on the
    Secondary Securities and, upon exercise of such right, may collapse the
    Custody Agreement and the Secondary Trust and, therefore, retains a level of
    control over the Secondary Securities.  The purchase price of the Secondary
    Securities is equal to the par amount plus 10% of any increase in the market
    value of the underlying Senior Certificates.  The Partnership has also
    pledged $12,600,000 of its Woodbridge Apartments of Bloomington III tax-
    exempt mortgage bonds and $5,300,000 of Primary Trust Certificates related
    to the Northwoods Lake Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bonds as additional

                                     -21-

    collateral in connection with the securitization. (Also see Notes 5(5), (8)
    and (9)).

    The Partnership also securitized tax-exempt mortgage bonds of $16,000,000
    on Clear Lake Colony Apartments which was acquired by the Partnership on
    June 8, 2000 and $11,130,000 on Bent Tree Apartments which was acquired on
    December 21, 2000.  Such securitizations are structured similar to the
    $17,155,000 securitization described above.  Floating rate securities in
    the amount of $15,995,000 and $11,125,000 for Clear Lake Colony Apartments
    and Bent Tree Apartments, respectively, were sold to institutional investors
    and the Partnership acquired residual interests in trusts with a face value
    of $10,000 ($5,000 for each of the securitized bonds) for $10,000 ($5,000
    each).  The Partnership also pledged $8,976,000 of its Woodbridge Apartments
    of Louisville II tax-exempt mortgage bonds and $2,000,000 of Primary Trust
    Certificates related to the Northwoods Lake Apartments tax-exempt mortgage
    bonds as additional collateral in connection with the securitization of
    the Clear Lake Colony Apartments bonds.  The Partnership also pledged
    $6,700,000 of its Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest tax-exempt mortgage bonds as
    additional collateral in connection with the securitization of the Bent
    Tree Apartments Bonds. (Also see Notes 5(6), (7), (8), (10) and (11)).

    For financial statement purposes, the transactions described above have
    been accounted for as financing transactions and, in effect, provide
    variable-rate financing for the acquisition of new, or the securitization of
    existing, tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  Accordingly, the $49,255,000 of
    tax-exempt mortgage bonds financed are required to be held in trust, the
    subordinated interests are classified as other assets, and, in the case of
    the $5,000,000 debt financing, the net cash proceeds were classified as cash
    and temporary cash investments.  In all of the transactions, the financing
    debt bears interest, plus credit enhancement, servicing, trustee and related
    fees.  Financing debt of $32,130,000 bears interest at a weekly floating
    bond rate which averaged approximately 5.18% for 2000, including fees. The
    remaining $17,125,000 of financing debt provided for interest at a weekly
    floating rate through June 21, 2000 at which time the Partnership elected to
    lock in the then current rate of 4.70% until June 20, 2001.  The stated
    maturity date is October 2011 for the $5,000,000 of debt financing,
    September 2002 for the $16,000,000 of debt financing, June 2002 for the
    $11,130,000 of debt financing and the final stated maturity date is April
    2004 for the remaining $17,125,000 of debt financing.  In each case, the
    debt financing is subject to the respective call feature described above.
    The Partnership did not recognize a gain or loss in connection with any of
    the financing transactions.

  F)Net Income per BUC
    Net income per BUC has been calculated based on the weighted average number
    of BUCs outstanding during each year presented.  The Partnership has no
    dilutive BUCs and, therefore, basic net income per BUC is the same as
    diluted net income per BUC.

  G)New Accounting Pronouncement
    In June, 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133).  This statement provides
				new accounting and reporting standards for the use of derivative
				instruments.  Adoption of this statement, as amended, is required by the
				Partnership effective January 1, 2001.  The adoption had no material
    impact on the financial statements.

3.  Partnership Income, Expenses and Cash Distributions

The Partnership Agreement of the New Partnership contains provisions for the
distribution of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds and for the
allocation of income and expenses for tax purposes among AFCA 2 and BUC
Holders.  Income and expenses will be allocated to each BUC Holder on a
periodic basis as determined by the General Partner based on the number of
BUCs held by each BUC Holder as of the last day of the period for which such
allocation is to be made.  Distributions of Net Interest Income and Net
Residual Proceeds will be made to each BUC Holder of record on the last day of
each distribution period based on the number of BUCs held by each BUC Holder
as of such date.


                                     -22-
AMERICA FIRST TAX EXEMPT INVESTORS, L.P.
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2000


Net Interest Income, as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement, in each
distribution period will be distributed 99% to the BUC Holders and 1% to AFCA 2.
The portion of Net Residual Proceeds, as defined in the Limited Partnership
Agreement, representing a return of principal will be distributed 100% to the
BUC Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Net Interest Income representing contingent
interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest in an
amount equal to .9% per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage bonds on
a cumulative basis will be distributed 75% to the BUC Holders and 25% to
AFCA 2.

Cash distributions are currently made on a quarterly basis but may be made on
a monthly or semiannual basis if AFCA 2 so elects.  The cash distributions
included in the financial statements represent the actual cash distributions
made during each year and the cash distributions accrued at the end of each
year.

4. Partnership Reserve Account

The Partnership maintains a reserve account which totaled $5,751,825 at
December 31, 2000.  The reserve account was established to maintain working
capital for the Partnership and is available to supplement distributions to
BUC Holders or for any other contingencies related to the ownership of the
mortgage bonds and the operation of the Partnership.

In connection with the Partnership's plan to repurchase up to $1,000,000 of
the Partnership's Beneficial Unit Certificates (BUCs), the Partnership
utilized a portion of the reserve account to purchase and cancel, in open
market transactions, 141,200 BUCs at an aggregate cost of $755,929 during 2000.

5. Investment in Tax-Exempt Mortgage Bonds

The mortgage bonds are issued by various state and local governments, their
agencies and authorities to finance the construction or rehabilitation of
income-producing real estate properties.  However, the mortgage bonds do not
constitute an obligation of any state or local government, agency or authority
and no state or local government, agency or authority is liable on them, nor
is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of
principal or interest on the mortgage bonds.  The mortgage bonds are
nonrecourse obligations of the respective owners of the properties.  The sole
source of the funds to pay principal and interest on the mortgage bonds is the
net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the properties.  Each
mortgage bond, however, is collateralized by a first mortgage on all real and
personal property included in the related property and an assignment of rents.

Each of the bonds bears interest at a fixed rate and provides for the payment
of additional contingent interest that is payable solely from available net
cash flow generated by the financed property. The principal amount of all but
one of the bonds does not amortize over its terms.

During 2000, the Partnership acquired three additional tax-exempt mortgage
bonds secured by three multifamily apartment properties for a total of
$44,285,000.

The Partnership classified its investment in tax-exempt mortgage bonds as
available-for-sale.  At December 31, 2000, the total amortized cost, gross
unrealized holding gains and aggregate fair value of available-for-sale
securities were $108,781,000, $1,719,000, and $110,500,000, respectively.  At
December 31 1999, the total amortized cost, gross unrealized holding losses
and aggregate fair value of available-for-sale securities were $72,626,000,
$906,000 and $71,720,000 respectively.  The Partnership recorded other
comprehensive income from unrealized gains on its investment in tax-exempt
mortgage bonds of $2,625,000 in 2000 and $4,594,000 in 1998.  No such
unrealized gains or losses were recorded in 1999.

 (1) In addition to the base interest rate shown, the bond bears additional
contingent interest as defined in the revenue note which, when combined with
the base interest, is limited to a cumulative, noncompounded amount not
greater than 12% per annum.  The Partnership received additional contingent
interest from Arama Apartments of $75,795 in 1999 and $122,099 in 1998.  No
contingent interest was received in 2000.  The Partnership sold its investment
in this tax-exempt mortgage bond on September 11, 2000 as described below.

 (2) In addition to the base interest rates shown, the bonds bear contingent
interest, as defined in each revenue note, of an additional 3.5% per annum
that is payable out of 50% (100% in the case of Shoals Crossing, Ashley Pointe
at Eagle Crest and Northwoods Lake Apartments) of the net cash flow generated
by the respective property.  The Partnership received contingent interest of
$22,702 from Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest in 1999.  No contingent interest was
received from any of the other mortgage bonds in 1999 nor was contingent
interest received from any mortgage bonds in 2000 and 1998.

 (3) In addition to the base interest rate shown, the bond bears contingent
interest, as defined in the revenue note, of an additional 3% per annum
payable out of the net cash flow generated by the property.   Past due unpaid
contingent interest compounds at a rate of 10.5% per annum.  The Partnership
did not receive any contingent interest during 2000, 1999 or 1998.

 (4) In addition to the base interest rate shown, the bonds bear contingent
interest, as defined in the revenue note, of an additional 2.6% per annum,
1.885% per annum and 1.9% per annum for Iona Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake
Colony Apartments and Bent Tree Apartments, respectively, payable out of the
net cash flow generated by each such the property.  Past due unpaid contingent
interest compounds at a rate of 9.5% per annum, 8.785% per annum and 9% per
annum for Iona Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake Colony Apartments and Bent Tree
Apartments, respectively.

 (5) Tax-exempt mortgage bonds of $12,600,000, in addition to the $5,300,000
of Primary Trust Certificates described in (8) below, have been pledged as
additional security to the beneficial owner of the tax-exempt mortgage bonds

During 1998, the Partnership determined it was not likely to recover or
receive its contracted cash flows (including the repayment of principal) on
its $12,100,000 investment in the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bond.
Accordingly, the Partnership realized a loss of $4,000,000 and the carrying
value was written down to a fair value $8,100,000 as the new carrying value.
Concurrently, the unrealized holding losses related to the investment in
tax-exempt mortgage bonds, which is a component of accumulated comprehensive
income, was reduced by $4,000,000; therefore, the realized loss had no impact
on total Partners' Capital.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2000, the
Partnership determined it was even less likely than in 1998 to recover or
receive its contracted cash flows (including the repayment of principal) on
the Arama Apartments tax-exempt mortgage bond.  Accordingly, the Partnership
realized an additional loss of $1,100,000 on the Arama Apartments tax-exempt
mortgage bond in 2000 and the carrying value was further written down to a
fair value of $7,000,000 as the new carrying value.  On September 11, 2000,
the Partnership sold its investment in the Arama Apartments tax-exempt
mortgage bond to the obligor of such bond.  Since the carrying value of such
bond was also $7,000,000, the Partnership realized no additional loss on the
sale.

During 1999, the tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by Shoals Crossing and
Ashley Square were reissued by the respective state and local housing finance
authorities.  In each case, the existing tax-exempt mortgage bond held by the
Partnership was terminated and a new bond in the same principal amount was

issued to the Partnership. No gain or loss was recorded on the reissuances.
The Partnership has coordinated the reissuance of the bonds with the local
housing finance authorities in order to allow the bonds to continue to
generate tax-exempt interest for the Partnership at interest rates that will
allow debt service on the bonds to be paid from the net revenues projected to
be generated by the financed properties.  Prior to reissuance, each of the
bonds earned base interest at the rate of 8.5% per annum and provided for
additional contingent interest, when combined with base interest, could equal
up to a maximum of 16% per annum.  No gain or loss was recorded by the
Partnership in 1999 in connection with the reissuance of the tax-exempt
mortgage bonds.

6. Investment in Other Tax-Exempt Bonds

At December 31, 2000, the Partnership had an investment in other tax-exempt
bonds with a principle amount of $3,000,000.  Such tax-exempt bonds bear
interest at the rate of 8.25% per annum and mature on December 1, 2026.  The
bonds are guaranteed by an affiliate of the borrower of such funds.

The Partnership classified its investment in other tax-exempt mortgage bonds
as available-for sale.  At December 31, 2000, the general partner estimates
that the fair value of the tax-exempt bonds was $3,000,000.

7. Transactions with Related Parties

Substantially all of the Partnership's general and administrative expenses and
certain costs capitalized by the Partnership are paid by AFCA 2 or an
affiliate and are reimbursed by the Partnership.  The capitalized costs were
incurred in connection with the reissuance of tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  The
amounts of such expenses reimbursed to AFCA 2 or an affiliate are shown
below.  The amounts are presented on a cash basis and do not reflect accruals
made at each year end.

AFCA 2 is entitled to receive an administrative fee from the Partnership equal
to 0.45% of the outstanding principal balance of any tax-exempt mortgage bond
or other mortgage investment, unless the owner of the property financed by
such tax-exempt mortgage bond or other mortgage investment or another third
party is required to pay such administrative fee.  Under the terms of each of
the  Partnership's existing tax-exempt mortgage bonds, the property owners are
obligated to pay the administrative fee to AFCA 2.  Therefore, the
Partnership did not pay any administrative fees to AFCA 2 related to its
investment in tax-exempt mortgage bonds for the year ended December 31, 2000
or for the period in 1999 subsequent to the merger.  However, for the year
ended December 31, 2000, the Partnership paid to AFCA 2 $1,425 in
administrative fees related to an investment in tax-exempt bonds it acquired
in November 2000.  The Partnership may become obligated to pay additional
administrative fees to AFCA 2 in the event it acquires additional tax-exempt
mortgage bonds or other mortgage investments and is not able to negotiate the
payment of these fees by the property owners or in the event it acquires title
to any of the properties securing its existing tax-exempt mortgage bonds by

reason of foreclosure.  AFCA 2 received administrative fees of $369,548,
$286,732 and $90,479 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, from the owners of
properties financed by the tax-exempt mortgage bonds held by the Partnership.
Since these administrative fees are not Partnership expenses, they have not
been reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  However, such fees
are payable by the property owners prior to the payment of any contingent
interest on the tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by these properties.

Under the terms of the Prior Partnership's partnership agreement, AFCA 2 was
entitled to an administrative fee equal to 0.45% of the original principal
amount of the properties financed by the tax-exempt mortgage bonds, payable by
the owners of such financed properties.  AFCA 2 was entitled to an
administrative fee from the Partnership in the event the Partnership became
the equity owner of a property by reason of foreclosure.  AFCA 2 was not
entitled to any administrative fees from the Partnership for the period in
1999 prior to the merger or for the year ended December 31, 1998.  In
addition, AFCA 2 was entitled to receive approximately $359,000 in
administrative fees from the Partnership for the year ended December 31,
1989.  The payment of these fees, which has been deferred by AFCA 2, is
contingent upon, and will be paid only out of future profits realized by the
New Partnership from the disposition of any Partnership assets.  This amount
will be recorded as an expense by the New Partnership when it is probable that
these fees will be paid.

AFCA 2 earned mortgage placement fees of $442,850 during the year ended
December 31, 2000, in connection with the acquisitions of the Iona Lakes
Apartments, the Clear Lake Colony Apartments, and Bent Tree Apartments
tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  The mortgage placement fees were paid by the
owners of the respective apartment properties and, accordingly, have not been
reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  No such fees were earned
by AFCA 2 in 1999 or 1998.

An affiliate of AFCA 2 was retained to provide property management services
for Ashley Square, Northwoods Lake Apartments, Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest
Shoals Crossing, Iona Lakes Apartments (beginning in April 2000), Clear Lake
Colony Apartments (beginning in June 2000) and Bent Tree Apartments (beginning
in December 2000). The management fees paid to the affiliate of AFCA 2 reflect
market rates for such services in the areas in which these properties are
located and amounted to $478,179 in 2000, $320,368 in 1999, and $310,225 in
1998.  These management fees are not Partnership expenses and, accordingly,
have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  However,
such fees are paid out of the revenues generated by these properties prior to
the payment of any interest on the tax-exempt mortgage bonds held by the
Partnership on these properties.

The Partnership's "other assets" include approximately $3,500,000 of taxable
mortgage loans due from the owners of Iona Lakes Apartments, Clear Lake Colony
Apartments and Bent Tree Apartments which collateralize the Partnership's
respective tax-exempt mortgage bonds.  The taxable mortgage loans bear
interest ranging from 8.25% to 9.10% per annum, may be repaid at any time, and
may increase for additional advances.  Each such taxable mortgage loan is
secured by a second mortgage on the respective property.  The owners of the
aforementioned properties are employees of the general partner of AFCA 2.

8.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Partnership in
estimating the fair value of its financial instruments:

    Cash and cash equivalents, interest receivable, other assets, accounts
    payable, distributions payable and debt financing:  Due to their
    short-term nature, fair value approximates the carrying value of such
    assets and liabilities.

    Investment in tax-exempt mortgage bonds and investment in other
    tax-exempt bonds:  Fair value is based on the general partner's estimate
	   of fair value.

                           REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE






























































                                     -38-

                           REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Audit Committee of America First Companies LLC ("America First"), which is
the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership, is currently
comprised of Martin A. Massengale, William S. Carter and Mariann Byerwalter,
each of whom is an independent manager of America First.  The Audit Committee
operates under a written charter.

The Partnership's management, which consists of the Partnership's general
partner and America First, is responsible for the preparation of the
Partnership's financial statements and for maintaining an adequate system of
internal controls and processes for that purpose.  KPMG LLP ("KPMG") acts as
the Partnership's independent auditors and they are responsible for conducting
an independent audit of the Partnership's annual financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and issuing a report on
the results of their audit.  The Audit Committee is responsible for providing
independent, objective oversight of both of these processes.

The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 with management of the
Partnership and with representatives of KPMG.  As a result of these
discussions, the Audit Committee believes that the Partnership maintains an
effective system of accounting controls that allow it to prepare financial
statements that fairly present the Partnership's financial position and
results of its operations.  Discussions with KPMG also included the matters
required by Statement on Auditing Standard No. 61 (Communications with Audit
Committees).

In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the independence of KPMG.  We
received written disclosures and a letter from KPMG regarding its independence
as required by Independent Standards Board Standards No. 1 and discussed this
information with KPMG.

Based on the foregoing, the Audit Committee has recommended to the full Board
of Managers that the audited financial statements of the Partnership for the
year ended December 31, 2000 be included in the Partnership's annual report on
Form 10-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
