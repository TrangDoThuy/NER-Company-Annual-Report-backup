equal to three months of his salary plus the amount of insurance premiums
payable under such officer's employment agreement which, as of January 1, 2001,

Rigas and his spouse. Upon the earlier of the death of Mr. Rigas and the death

(a)      The  holders  of Class B common  stock are  deemed to be  beneficial
         owners of an equal number of shares of Class A common stock because
         Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock on a
         one-to-one basis. See note (c) below. In addition, the following
         persons own or have the power to direct the voting of shares of Class A
         common stock in the following amounts: John J. Rigas, 431,800 shares -
         71,700 shares directly and 360,100 shares through Doris Holdings, L.P.

         shares directly and 193,300 shares through Doris; James P. Rigas,
         193,300 shares through Doris. John J. Rigas shares voting power with
         his spouse with respect to 106,300 of such shares held through Doris.

<PAGE>

         Each of John J. Rigas, Michael J. Rigas, Timothy J. Rigas and James P.
         Rigas also shares voting and dispositive power with respect to the
         8,401,522 shares of Class B common stock owned by Highland 2000, L.P.,
         the 19,128,108 shares of Class A common beneficially owned by Highland
         Holdings and subsidiaries ("Highland"), the 4,000,000 shares of Class A
         common held by Highland Holdings II ("Highland II") and the other
         1,458,151 shares of Class A common held by Doris. See notes (h) and
         (i).

(b)      After giving effect to the conversion  solely by each individual holder
         of all of his Class B common stock into Class A common stock and
         including all shares of Class A common stock, currently held by such
         individual holder or over which such individual holder has or shares
         voting or investment power as disclosed in notes (a) above or (h) and
         (i) below, the percentage of Class A common stock owned by John J.
         Rigas, Michael J. Rigas, Timothy J. Rigas and James P. Rigas would be
         23.8%, 21.9%, 21.9% and 21.5%, respectively. Further, after giving
         effect to an additional 4,919,340 shares of Class A common stock of
         which John J. Rigas has the right to direct the voting in the election
         of directors pursuant to a Class B Stockholders Agreement (and assuming
         the parties to such agreement converted their Class B common stock into
         Class A common stock), as to all of which additional shares John J.
         Rigas disclaims beneficial ownership, the percentage of Class A common
         stock owned by John J. Rigas would be 26.0%.

(c)      The  respective  amounts shown  include,  other than for Highland 2000,
         L.P., 97,949 of the same shares of Class B common stock which are owned
         of record by Dorellenic, a general partnership in which the five named
         individual Rigas family members are general partners and include, for
         all amounts shown, 8,401,522 of the same shares of Class B common stock
         which are owned by Highland 2000, L.P., a limited partnership in which
         the five named individual Rigas family members are limited partners,
         and such shares are only included once for "all executive officers and
         directors as a group." The named Rigas individuals have shared voting
         and investment power with respect to these shares. The shares of Class
         B common stock shown for Peter L. Venetis represent the shares
         beneficially owned by his wife, Ellen K. Rigas. The respective amounts
         shown for each individual or group do not include any of the 17,976,717
         shares of Class B common stock consisting of (i) 5,819,637 shares of
         Class B common stock that Highland 2000, L.P. has agreed to purchase
         from Adelphia on or before October 20, 2001, pursuant to a pending
         purchase agreement and (ii) 3,016,165 shares and 9,141,185 shares of
         Class B common stock, respectively, which could be issued upon
         conversion of convertible notes that Highland 2000, L.P. has agreed to
         purchase from Adelphia on or before October 20, 2001 and January 20,
         2002 pursuant to pending purchase agreements.

(d)      Less than 1%.

(e)      Peter L. Venetis is the husband of Ellen K. Rigas.  As a result, he is
         deemed to beneficially own indirectly the shares beneficially owned by
         Ellen K. Rigas. Based upon 2,500 shares of Class A common stock owned

<PAGE>

         directly by Mr. Venetis and the shares of Class A common stock owned or
         deemed to be owned beneficially by Ellen K. Rigas, the percentage of
         Class A common stock owned or deemed to be beneficially owned by Mr.
         Venetis would be 19.6%. See notes (c), (f), (g) and (i).

(f)      As a holder of Class B common stock, Ellen K. Rigas is deemed to be the
         beneficial owner of an equal number of shares of Class A common stock
         because Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock
         on a one-to-one basis. In addition, Ellen K. Rigas owns 1,600 shares of
         Class A common stock directly and shares voting and investment power
         with respect to 19,128,108 shares of Class A common stock held by
         Highland and 4,000,000 shares of Class A common stock held by Highland
         II. See also notes (c) and (i). Ellen K. Rigas is the daughter of John
         J. Rigas.

(g)      After giving effect to the conversion of all of Ellen K. Rigas' Class B
         common stock into shares of Class A common stock and including all
         shares of Class A common stock held by Ellen K. Rigas or over which
         Ellen K. Rigas has or shares voting or investment power as discussed in
         note (i) below, the percentage of Class A common stock owned by Ellen
         K. Rigas would be 19.6%.

(h)      Doris and Eleni Acquisition,  Inc., the general partner of Doris, are
         affiliates of John J. Rigas, Michael J. Rigas, Timothy J. Rigas and
         James P. Rigas, each of whom has shared voting and investment power
         with respect to the shares held by Doris. In addition, through
         irrevocable proxies, each of the above-named individuals shares with
         Doris the power to vote or direct the vote of such number of shares of
         Class A common stock held as is described in note (a).

         partners of which are John J. Rigas, Michael J. Rigas, Timothy J.
         Rigas, James P. Rigas and Ellen K. Rigas. These Rigas family members
         may be deemed to share voting and investment power with respect to the
         shares held by Highland's wholly owned subsidiaries, Highland
         Communications, L.L.C. and Highland Preferred Communications, L.L.C.,
         and also with respect to the shares held by Highland II. The amount

(j)      After giving effect to the conversion of all of Highland 2000, L.P.'s
         Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock, the

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

Management Services

         During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company provided
management services for certain cable television systems not owned by the
Company, including managed partnerships ("Managed Partnerships") in which John
J. Rigas, Michael J. Rigas, Timothy J. Rigas, James P. Rigas and Ellen K. Rigas
had varied ownership interests. These services included supervision of technical
and business operations, accounting, marketing, programming, purchasing, field
engineering and other technical and administrative nonfield services. During
this period, the Managed Partnerships paid the Company up to five percent of
system revenues for such services. Other fees were charged by the Company to the
Managed Partnerships during this period for goods and services including
mark-ups on the Company's pay programming, placement fees associated with
completed and pending acquisitions, and other goods and services. In addition,
the Managed Partnerships charged the Company for system and corporate costs
during this period. The net fees and expenses charged by the Company to Managed
Partnerships amounted to $37,579,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. In
addition, the Company paid $15,864,000 to other entities owned by members of the
Rigas family, primarily for property, plant and equipment and services for the
year ended December 31, 2000.

Loans to and from Affiliates

         Certain loans to and from the Company by or to affiliates as of
December 31, 2000 are summarized below. Interest is charged on such loans to
affiliates at rates which ranged from 9.00% to 11.31% for the year ended
December 31, 2000.

         Total interest income on loans to managed affiliates aggregated
$40,333,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.

         Net receivables due from the Managed Partnerships and Dorellenic, a
Rigas family partnership, for advances made by the Company for the construction
and acquisition of cable television systems and for working capital purposes,
including accrued interest thereon, were $3,071,000 at December 31, 2000.

         On an end-of-quarter basis, the largest aggregate amount of net
outstanding loans and advances receivable from affiliates (directors, executive
officers and five-percent shareholders) or entities they control, including John
J. Rigas, Michael J. Rigas, Timothy J. Rigas, James P. Rigas, Ellen K. Rigas,
Dorellenic and/or the Managed Partnerships during the year ended December 31,
2000 was $263,135,000 at June 30, 2000. No related party advances are
collateralized.


Co-Borrowing Agreements

         On March 29, 1996, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a
$200,000,000 loan agreement with a Managed Partnership and an Olympus
subsidiary, as co-borrowers, which agreement remained in effect at December 31,
2000. On May 6, 1999, certain subsidiaries and affiliates of Adelphia and
Olympus, including Hilton Head Communications, L.P., a Rigas family partnership,

<PAGE>

closed on an $850,000,000 credit facility with several banks, which consists of
a $600,000,000 8 1/2 year reducing revolving credit loan and a $250,000,000 9
year term loan, and which remained in effect at December 31, 2000.


         On April 14, 2000, certain subsidiaries and affiliates of Adelphia,
including Highland Prestige Georgia, Inc., a Rigas family partnership, closed on
a $2,250,000,000 credit facility with several banks. The credit facility
consists of a $1,500,000,000 8 3/4 year reducing revolving credit loan and a
$750,000,000 9 year term loan. Additionally, on September 28, 2000, Adelphia
closed on a $500,000,000 9 1/4 year term loan through certain subsidiaries and
affiliates of Adelphia. This term loan is an additional part of the credit
facility closed on April 14, 2000, all of which remained in effect at December
31, 2000.

         In the aggregate, at December 31, 2000, certain subsidiaries of
Adelphia were co-borrowers with Managed Entities under these credit facilities
for borrowings of up to $3,751,250,000. Each of the co-borrowers is liable for
all borrowings under the credit agreements, and may borrow up to the entire
amount of the available credit under the facility. The lenders have no recourse
against Adelphia other than against Adelphia's interest in such subsidiaries.

Business Opportunities

         The Company's executive officers are parties to a Business Opportunity
Agreement, dated July 1, 1986 (the "Business Opportunity Agreement"), under
which they have agreed not to acquire an interest (except that such persons may,
individually for their own account, engage in regular portfolio trading of
publicly traded securities of companies in the cable television industry) in any
cable television system except: cable television systems which they or their
affiliates (excluding the Company) owned, in whole or in part, operated or had
agreed to acquire as of July 1, 1986; any expansions of such systems within the
same county or an adjacent county (except for systems which are also contiguous
to Company-owned systems); and systems which the Company elects not to acquire
under its right of first refusal described below and any expansions of such
systems within the same county or an adjacent county (except for systems which
are also contiguous to Company-owned systems). Otherwise, the executive officers
will first offer to the Company the opportunity to acquire or invest in any
cable television system or franchise therefor or interest therein that is
offered or available to them. If a majority of the Company's Board of Directors,
including a majority of the independent directors, rejects such offer, the
executive officers may acquire or invest in all of such cable television systems
or franchises therefor or interest therein or with others on terms no more
favorable to them than those offered to the Company. During the year ended
December 31, 2000, pursuant to the Business Opportunities Agreement, entities
owned by the executive officers acquired cable television systems serving
approximately 58,200 basic subscribers.

         The Company's executive officers may from time to time evaluate and,
subject to the Company's rights and covenants in the Company's loan agreements
and indentures, may acquire cable television systems or interests therein for
their own accounts separately or along with the Company and/or other joint
venture parties.
<PAGE>

         Except for the limitations on the ownership of cable television systems
as described herein, the executive officers of Adelphia and their affiliates are
not subject to limitations with respect to their other business activities and
may engage in other businesses related to cable television or other
telecommunications media. The executive officers will devote as much of their
time to the business of the Company as is reasonably required to fulfill the
duties of their offices.

         In the event that any executive officer (or his affiliate) decides to
offer for sale (other than to another executive officer or his or another
executive officer's family member, trust or family controlled entity) for his
account, his ownership interest in any cable television system or franchise, he
or it will (subject to the rights of third parties existing at such time) first
offer such interests to the Company. Such selling person or entity has a
unilateral option to elect to require that, if the Company accepts such offer,
up to one half of the consideration for his or its interest would consist of
shares of Class B common stock, which shares will be valued at the prevailing
market price of the Class A common stock, and the remainder would consist of
shares of Class A common stock and/or cash. If a majority of the Company's
independent directors rejects such offer, the executive officer (or his
affiliate) may sell such interest to third parties on terms no more favorable to
such third parties than those offered to the Company.


Registration Rights, Stock Purchase and Other Matters

         Pursuant to agreements and arrangements regarding registration rights
between the Company and the holders of Class B common stock, during 2000 John J.
Rigas had the right, subject to certain limitations, to require the Company to
register shares of the Company's common stock owned by him for sale to the
public and pay the expenses (except for Mr. Rigas' counsel fees) of such
registration on five occasions selected by him (subject to certain limitations
intended to prevent undue interference with the Company's ability to distribute
its securities) during a fourteen-year period which began in December 1986. The
other holders of Class B common stock had the right to participate, at the
option of John J. Rigas, as selling stockholders in any such registration
initiated by John J. Rigas. The holders of Class B common stock also had
unlimited rights to participate as selling stockholders in any registered public
offering initiated by the Company and require the Company to pay their expenses
(except counsel fees). Such rights of participation were subject to limitation
at the discretion of the managing underwriter of any such offering.

         Substantially all of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock
owned by the Rigas family or entities they own or control has been registered by
the Company on shelf registration statements, which remain in effect, or is
subject to registration rights agreements or arrangements for registration in
the future.

         On April 9, 1999, Adelphia entered into a stock purchase agreement with
Highland Holdings in which Adelphia agreed to sell to Highland Holdings, and
Highland Holdings agreed to purchase $375,000,000 of Adelphia Class B common
stock. The purchase price per share for the Class B common stock was equal to
$60.76 (the public offering price in Adelphia's April 28, 1999 public offering,
less the underwriting discount), plus an interest factor. This transaction,
covering 5,901,522 shares of Class B common stock, was closed on January 21,
2000 with Highland 2000, L.P. In addition, the Rigas family waived their rights
under the Business Opportunity Agreement to acquire certain basic subscribers in

<PAGE>

the Philadelphia area in connection with Adelphia's acquisition, on October 1,
1999, of the cable television systems owned by Harron Communications Corp.

         On October 1, 1999, Adelphia entered into a stock purchase agreement
with Highland Holdings in which Adelphia agreed to sell to Highland Holdings and
Highland Holdings agreed to purchase $137,500,000 of Adelphia's Class B common
stock. The purchase price for the Class B common stock was $55.00 per share,
which is equal to the public offering price less the underwriting discount in
the October 6, 1999 public offering of Class A common stock, plus an interest
factor. This transaction, covering 2,500,000 shares of Class B common stock, was
closed on July 2, 2000 with Highland 2000, L.P.

         With respect to purchase agreements between the Company and Highland
2000, L.P., for Class B common stock and convertible subordinated notes which
were entered into subsequent to December 31, 2000, incorporated by reference
herein is (i) Note 15 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and
(ii) Item 5 of the Company's Form 8-K filed on April 25, 2001.

         In July 2000, certain members of the Rigas family closed on their
agreement to acquire all the voting interests of Niagara Frontier Hockey, L.P.
("NFHLP"). In conjunction with the closing of this agreement, Adelphia's Capital
Funding Notes of NFHLP were converted to a $46,500,000, 10% partially
subordinated note due in July 2010. Concurrently, with the recapitalization of
NFHLP, Adelphia also purchased a $30,000,000, 10% fully subordinated note due
July 2010. Both notes pay interest quarterly with principal due at maturity.

         The Company and Adelphia Business Solutions and members of or entities
controlled by the Rigas family have entered into various registration rights
agreements regarding the common stock and Senior Subordinated Notes owned by the
Rigas family.


         From time to time, the Company makes announcements regarding proposed
transactions that may involve affiliates of the Company. No assurance can be
given that these transactions will be consummated.
