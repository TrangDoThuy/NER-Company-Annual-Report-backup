EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

         On February 19, 1997, Messrs. Stein and Briskin each entered into an
employment agreement with us. The term of such employment agreements (subject to
earlier termination for cause) was initially for a period of five years and
currently continues for successive one-year terms unless canceled by either
party. During the term of such employment agreements, Messrs. Stein and Briskin
each receive a base salary (currently $220,000 in 2002) which increases annually
by 10 percent of the prior year's salary plus the increase in the consumer price
index, which annual increase may not, in any event, exceed 20 percent of the
prior year's salary. In addition, Messrs. Stein and Briskin are each entitled to
receive an annual bonus equal to five percent of our pre-tax net income in each
fiscal year. We provide each of Messrs. Stein and Briskin with an automobile
allowance of $500 per month and a term life insurance policy in the amount of
$500,000.

         In the event that during the term of such employment agreements there
is a change of control of our company which has not been approved by our
Board of Directors, Messrs. Stein and Briskin will have the option to terminate
their employment with us within three months of the change of control and
receive a lump sum payment of $750,000 each. In such event, all previously
granted stock options would become automatically vested. If the Board of
Directors approves a change of control, Messrs. Stein and Briskin may terminate
their employment, but would only be entitled to receive a payment equal to the
prior year's annual salary and to become automatically vested in a portion of
their stock options equal to their percentage completion of the term of their
employment agreement. For purposes of the employment agreements, a "change in
control" is defined as an event that: (i) would be required to be reported in
response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14(a) of Regulation 14A under the Exchange
Act; or (ii) causes a person other than Messrs. Stein and Briskin to
beneficially own more than 30 percent of our outstanding securities. As part of
such employment agreements, each of Messrs. Stein and Briskin have agreed not to
compete against us for a 12-month period following the termination of their
employment with us for any reason other than a change in control without the
approval of the Board of Directors.

STOCK OPTION PLAN

         The Company has adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the
"1996 Plan"). Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, options to acquire a maximum of 530,000
shares of Common Stock may be granted to Directors, executive officers,
employees (including employees who are Directors), independent contractors and
consultants of the Company. As of April 25, 2002, options to purchase 473,068
shares of Common Stock are outstanding under the 1996 Plan (287,114 of which are
currently vested).

         The 1996 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee determines which persons will
receive options and the number of options to be granted to such persons. The
Compensation Committee also interprets the provisions of the 1996 Plan and makes
all other determinations that it may deem necessary or advisable for the
administration of the 1996 Plan.


                                       8
<PAGE>

         Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the Company may grant both ISOs (Incentive
Stock Options) and NQSOs (Non-Qualified Stock Options). The price at which the
Company's Common Stock may be purchased upon the exercise of options granted
under the 1996 Plan are required to be at least equal to the per share fair
market value of the Common Stock on the date particular options are granted.
Options granted under the 1996 Plan may have maximum terms of not more than 10
years and are not transferable, except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution. None of the ISOs under the 1996 Plan may be granted to an
individual owning more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock issued by the Company unless the purchase price of the Common
Stock under such option is at least 110 percent of the fair market value of the
shares issuable on exercise of the option determined as of the date the option
is granted, and such option is not exercisable more than five years after the
grant date.

         Generally, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee or
the Board of Directors, options granted under the 1996 Plan remain outstanding
and may be exercised at any time up to three months after the person to whom
such options were granted is no longer employed or retained by the Company or
serving on the Company's Board of Directors.

         Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, unless otherwise determined by the
Compensation Committee, one-third of the options granted to an individual are
exercisable upon grant, one-third are exercisable on the first anniversary of
such grant and the final one-third are exercisable on the second anniversary of
such grant. However, options granted under the 1996 Plan shall become
immediately exercisable if the holder of such options is terminated by the
Company or is no longer a Director of the Company, as the case may be,
subsequent to certain events which are deemed to be a "change in control" of the
Company. A "change in control" of the Company generally is deemed to occur when
(i) any person becomes the beneficial owner of or acquires voting control with
respect to more than 20 percent of the Common Stock (or 35 percent if such
person is a holder of Common Stock on the effective date of the IPO) (ii) a
change occurs in the composition of a majority of the Company's Board of
Directors during a two-year period, provided that a change with respect to a
member of the Company's Board of Directors shall be deemed not to have occurred
if the appointment of a member of the Company's Board of Directors is approved
by a vote of at least 75 percent of the individuals who constitute the then
existing Board of Directors; or (iii) the Company's shareholders approve the
sale of substantially all of the Company's assets.

         ISOs granted under the 1996 Plan are subject to the restriction that
the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the date of grant) of options
which first become exercisable in any calendar year cannot exceed $100,000.

TOTAL OPTIONS OUTSTANDING

         We have a substantial number of stock options outstanding. Many of our
outstanding options (including a substantial portion of the options granted to
our non-employee directors and to our principal executive officers) were granted
outside of the 1996 Plan pursuant to individual stock option agreements. At the
date of this Form 10-K/A, the following options were outstanding: (i) options to
purchase an aggregate 47,000 shares of Common Stock held by consultants; (ii)
options to purchase an aggregate of 1,660,500 shares of Common Stock held by our
two principal executive officers (who are also our principal shareholders);
(iii) options to purchase 373,250 shares of Common Stock held by our
non-employee Directors; and (iv) options to purchase an aggregate of 446,368
shares of Common Stock held by our employees.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

         During the last fiscal year, no members of the Company's Compensation
Committee are or were current or former employees of the Company and there were
no material transactions between the Company and any of the members of the
Compensation Committee.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A)

         Based solely upon our review of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto
furnished to us pursuant to Rule 16a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the "Exchange Act"), during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and
any Forms 5 and amendments thereto furnished to us with respect to such fiscal
year, and any written representations referred to in subparagraph (b)(2)(i) of
Item 405 of Regulation S-K, except as set forth below, no person who at any time
during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 was a Director, officer or, to
our knowledge, a beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of our equity
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, failed to file
on a timely basis, as disclosed in Forms 3, 4 and 5, reports required by Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001. In
that regard, each of our officers and Directors were late in filing their Form 5
relating to their ownership of Company securities during 2001.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

         We are parties to a lease with RSB Holdings, Inc., a Florida
corporation ("RSB Holdings"), pursuant to which we lease our corporate
headquarters and warehouse in North Miami, Florida. We make annual payments
under such lease in the amount of approximately $43,200. Messrs. Stein and
Briskin each own 50 percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of RSB
Holdings, and are its sole officers and directors.

         In January 2002, we converted $152,000 due to Messrs. Stein and Briskin
into 190,000 shares of our Common Stock (at a conversion price of $.80 per
share, which was the fair market value on the date of conversion). Such debt
related, among other matters, to amounts due Messrs. Stein and Briskin through
the end of 2001 under their employment agreements.

         We believe that all the foregoing related-party transactions were on
terms, as a whole, no less favorable to us than could reasonably be obtained
from unaffiliated third parties. All transactions with affiliates have been
approved by a majority of disinterested Directors of the Company and on terms no
less favorable to the Company than those that are generally available from
unaffiliated third parties.
