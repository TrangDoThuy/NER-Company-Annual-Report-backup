  PART I
  Item 1.         Business
  General
  Allcity Insurance Company (the "Registrant", "Allcity" or the
  "Company") is a property and casualty insurer.  Empire
  Insurance Company ("Empire"), a property and casualty insurer,
  owns approximately 84.6% of the outstanding common shares of
  the Company and 100% of the outstanding common shares of
  Centurion Insurance Company ("Centurion"). Empire's common
  shares are 100% owned and controlled, through subsidiaries, by
  Leucadia National Corporation ("Leucadia").  Additionally,
  Leucadia indirectly owns an additional 6.7% of the outstanding
  common shares of the Company.  The Company, Empire and
  Centurion are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to
  as the Group.

  Historically, the Group has specialized in commercial and
  personal property and casualty insurance business primarily in
  the New York metropolitan area.  The Group has offered
  insurance products for vehicles (including medallion and
  radio-controlled livery vehicles), general liability coverage,
  property coverage (including mercantile and multi-family
  residential real estate) and workers' compensation to
  commercial accounts and private passenger automobile and
  homeowners products to individuals.  The Group is organized
  into three divisions: the Small Business Division, the
  Personal Lines Division and the Mid-Market Division.  Each of
  these divisions has separate management teams responsible for
  all underwriting decisions with the Small Business Division
  focusing on commercial package products for small businesses;
  the Personal Lines Division focusing on personal automobile
  and homeowners insurance; and the Mid-Market Division focusing
  on commercial automobile, commercial package and workers'
  compensation insurance for larger accounts.

  During the past several years, the Group has experienced poor
  underwriting results and adverse reserve development in all of
  its lines of business.  The Group has responded to these
  developments by raising premium rates and reducing the volume
  of unprofitable business, while at the same time attempting to
  reduce its overhead.

  Effective January 1, 2000, all assigned risk policy renewal
  obligations were assigned to another insurance company.  In
  1999, a determination was made not to accept any applications
  for new private passenger automobile business from certain
  agents with the highest loss ratios.  During the fourth
  quarter of 2000, this determination was extended to include
  the entire agency force.  Existing policies of private
  passenger automobile insurance will be either sold,
  non-renewed or cancelled in accordance with New York insurance
  law.  If this book of business is not sold, it is expected
  that the Group will continue to issue renewal policies over
  the next several years as required by applicable insurance
  law.  The Group also announced that all statutory automobile
  policies (public livery vehicles) would be non-renewed
  effective March 1, 2001 due to poor underwriting results.

  On March 1, 2001, the Group announced that, effective
  immediately, it would no longer issue any new (as compared to
  renewal) insurance policies in any lines of business and that
  it has filed plans of orderly withdrawal with the New York
  Insurance Department as required.  Existing commercial lines
  policies will be non-renewed or canceled in accordance with
  New York insurance law or replaced by Tower Insurance Company
  of New York or Tower Risk Management (collectively, "Tower")
  under an agreement for the sale of the Group's renewal rights
  (the "Tower Agreement").  Under the Tower Agreement, Tower
  will buy the renewal rights for substantially all of the
  Group's remaining lines of business, excluding private
  passenger automobile and commercial automobile/garage, for a
  fee based on the direct written premium actually renewed by
  Tower.  The amount of the fee is not expected to be material.
  The Group will continue to be responsible for the remaining
  term of existing policies and all claims incurred prior to the
  expiration of these policies.  For commercial lines, the Group
  will thereafter have no renewal obligations for those
  policies.  Under New York insurance law, the Group is
  obligated to offer renewals of homeowners, dwelling fire,
  personal insurance coverage and personal umbrella for a
  three-year policy period; however, the Tower Agreement
  provides that Tower must offer replacements for these
  policies.  The closing of the transaction is subject to the
  approval of the New York Insurance Department.

  Certain of the lines of business included in the agreement
  with Tower historically had acceptable loss ratios.  However,
  despite repeated attempts, the Group has not been able to
  reduce its expenses sufficiently to be profitable with its
  reduced volume of business.  This has been due in part to
  information systems and a personnel infrastructure built to
  service multiple lines of property and casualty business where
  the costs are more fixed than variable in nature, and a high
  cost agency distribution channel.  An additional investment of
  both capital and management would have been required to
  attempt to reduce the Group's cost structure to a level
  commensurate with its book of business.  In weighing the
  potential returns against the risks inherent in that strategy,
  the Group determined not to make the investment.

<PAGE>

  The Group is currently exploring its options for the future.
  Assuming the Tower Agreement is consummated, the Group will
  only have renewal obligations for remaining personal lines
  insurance (primarily automobile) not replaced by Tower, the
  remaining policy term of all existing policies and a claim
  run-off operation.  The Group may commence new property and
  casualty insurance operations if a new business model with an
  acceptable expense structure can be developed, enter into a
  joint venture with another property and casualty insurance
  operation, explore entering the claim services business or
  commence a liquidation.  There may be other options that the
  Company will explore, but no assurance can be given at this
  time as to what the ultimate plan will be.

  The Group is rated "B+" (very good) by A.M. Best Company
  ("Best") and rated "BB-" (marginal) by Standards & Poors
  Insurance Rating Services ("S&P").  Should the Group decide to
  commence new property and casualty insurance operations or
  enter into an insurance joint venture, its existing ratings
  may affect its ability to pursue its plans.  As with all
  ratings, Best and S&P ratings are subject to change at any
  time.

  For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 net
  earned premiums for the Company were $30.9 million, $42.4
  million and $67.5 million, respectively. During the year ended
  December 31, 2000, 4% of net earned premiums of the Company
  were derived from assigned risk business, 21% from commercial
  automobile lines, 40% from other commercial lines and 35% from
  personal lines.  Substantially all of the Group's policies are
  written in New York for a one-year period.  The Group is
  licensed in New York to write most lines of insurance that may
  be written by a property and casualty insurer.  Empire is also
  licensed to write insurance in Connecticut, Massachusetts,
  Missouri, New Hampshire and New Jersey.

  On a quarterly basis, the Group reviews and adjusts its
  estimated loss reserves for any changes in trends and actual
  loss experience.  Included in the Company's results for 2000
  was approximately $15.9 million related to losses and loss
  adjustment expenses ("LAE") from prior accident years. The
  Group will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss
  reserves and record future adjustments to its loss reserves as
  appropriate.


Pooling Agreement

  All insurance business written by the Company is subject to a
  pooling agreement with Empire under which the Company and Empire
  effectively operate as one company. The pooling agreement and
  subsequent amendments were approved by the New York Insurance
  Department.  The Company operates under the same general management
  as Empire and has full use of Empire's personnel, information
  technology systems and facilities.  As of December 31, 2000, Empire
  and its subsidiaries had 335 full and part-time employees.
  Currently, and for all periods presented, all premiums, losses, LAE
  and other underwriting expenses are shared on the basis of 70% to
  Empire and 30% to the Company.

  Combined Ratios
  Set forth below is certain statistical information for the
  Company prepared in accordance with generally accepted
  accounting principles ("GAAP") and statutory accounting
  principles ("SAP"), for the three years ended December 31,
  2000.  The Loss Ratio is the ratio of net incurred losses and
  LAE to net premiums earned.  The Expense Ratio is the ratio of
  underwriting expenses (policy acquisition costs, commissions,
  and a portion of administrative, general and other expenses
  attributable to underwriting operations) to net premiums
  written, if determined in accordance with SAP, or to net
  premiums earned, if determined in accordance with GAAP.  A
  Combined Ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit and
  a Combined Ratio above 100% indicates an underwriting loss.
  The Combined Ratio does not include the effect of investment
  income.

  Reinsurance

  The Company's maximum retained limit for all lines of business
  was $0.3 million for 2000 and 1999.  The Company's maximum
  retained limit for 1998 was $0.5 million for workers'
  compensation and $0.3 million for other property and casualty
  lines.  Additionally, the Company has entered into a property
  catastrophe excess of loss treaty to protect against certain
  losses.  Its retention of lower level losses in this treaty is
  $7.5 million for 2001, and was $7.5 million for 2000, 1999 and
  1998.

  Effective January 1, 1997 Empire entered into a quota share
  reinsurance agreement with its subsidiary, Centurion.  Under
  this agreement, Empire assumes 50% up to July 1, 1997 and 75%
  thereafter of the effective period premiums and losses of
  Centurion and grants Centurion a ceding commission.  Under the
  pooling agreement, 70% of such business assumed will be
  retained by Empire and 30% will be ceded to the Company.

  Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer
  from its primary liability for the full amount of the policy
  liability, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the
  insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded. The Company's
  reinsurance generally has been placed with certain of the
  largest reinsurance companies, including (with their
  respective Best ratings) General Reinsurance Corporation (A++)
  and Zurich Reinsurance (NA), Inc. (A+).  The Company believes
  its reinsurers to be financially capable of meeting their
  respective obligations.  However, to the extent that any
  reinsuring company is unable to meet its obligations, the
  Company would be liable for the reinsured risks.  The Company
  has established reserves, which the Company believes are
  adequate, for any nonrecoverable reinsurance.

<PAGE>

  Investments

  Investment activities represent a significant part of the
  Company's total income.  Investments are managed by the
  Company's investment advisors under the direction of, and upon
  consultation with, the Company's investment committee.

  The Company has a diversified investment portfolio of
  securities, a substantial portion of which is rated
  "investment grade" by established bond rating agencies or
  issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by governmental
  agencies.  A portion of the Company's invested assets
  represent an investment in a limited partnership which invests
  principally in convertible preferred stocks, convertible
  long-term debt securities, limited partnerships, and common
  stocks sold, but not yet purchased.  At December 31, 2000,
  1999 and 1998, the average yield of the Company's bond
  portfolio was approximately 6.4%, 6.5% and 5.8%, respectively,
  and the average maturity of the Company's bond portfolio for
  2000, 1999 and 1998 was approximately 2.2 years, 2.6 years and
  3.2 years, respectively.

  Tax Sharing Agreement

  The Company has been included in the consolidated federal
  income tax returns of Leucadia since 1993.  Under the terms of
  the tax sharing agreement between Leucadia and the Company,
  the Company computes its tax provision on a separate return
  basis and is either charged its share of federal income tax
  resulting from its taxable income or is credited for tax
  benefits resulting from its losses to the extent it could use
  the losses on a separate return basis.

  Government Regulation

  Insurance companies are subject to detailed regulation and
  supervision in the states in which they transact business.
  Such regulation pertains to matters such as approving policy
  forms and various premium rates, minimum reserves and loss
  ratio requirements, the type and amount of investments,
  minimum capital and surplus requirements, granting and
  revoking licenses to transact business, levels of operations
  and regulating trade practices.  Insurance companies are
  required to file detailed annual reports with the supervising
  agencies in each of the states in which they do business, and
  are subject to examination by such agencies at any time.
  Increased regulation of insurance companies at the state level
  and new regulation at the federal level is possible, although
  the Company cannot predict the nature or extent of any such
  regulation or what impact it would have on the Company's
  operations.

  For additional information see Item 7, "Management's
  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
  Operations" of this Report.

  In 1998, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
  ("NAIC") adopted the Codification of Statutory
  Accounting Principles ("Codification"), which replaces the
  current Accounting Practices and Procedures manual as the
  NAIC's primary guidance on statutory accounting as of January
  1, 2001. The Codification provides guidance for areas where
  statutory accounting has been silent and changes current
  statutory accounting in some areas. The New York Insurance
  Department recently adopted the Codification guidance
  (Regulation 172), effective January 1, 2001, but did not adopt
  several key provisions of the guidance.  The Company will
  reflect the cumulative effect of the Codification guidance in
  its statutory financial statements as a direct adjustment to
  statutory surplus for the quarter ending March 31, 2001, to be
  filed with the New York Insurance Department by May 15, 2001.
  The Company is in the process of determining the potential
  effects of the codification.

  The Group is a member of state insurance funds, which provide
  certain protection to policyholders of insolvent insurers
  doing business in those states.  Due to insolvencies of
  certain insurers, the Group has been assessed certain amounts
  which have not been material and are likely to be assessed
  additional amounts by state insurance funds.  The Company
  believes that it has provided for all anticipated assessments
  and that any additional assessments will not have a material
  adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results
  of operations.

  Competition

  The insurance industry is a highly competitive industry, in
  which many of the Company's competitors have substantially
  greater financial resources, larger sales forces, more
  widespread agency and broker relationships, endorsements from
  affinity groups and more diversified lines of insurance
  coverage. Additionally, federal administrative, legislative
  and judicial activity has resulted in changes to federal
  banking laws that increase the ability of  national banks to
  offer insurance products.

  The Company believes that property and casualty insurers
  generally compete on the basis of price, customer service,
  consumer recognition, product design, product mix and
  financial stability.  The industry has historically been
  cyclical in nature, with periods of less intense price
  competition generating significant profits, followed by
  periods of increased price competition resulting in reduced
  profitability or loss.  The current cycle of intense price
  competition has continued for a longer period than in the
  past, suggesting that the significant infusion of capital into
  the industry in recent years, coupled with larger investment
  returns has been, and may continue to be, a depressing
  influence on policy rates.  The profitability of the property
  and casualty insurance industry is affected by many factors,
  including rate competition, severity and frequency of claims
  (including catastrophe losses), interest rates, state
  regulation, court decisions and judicial climate, all of which
  are outside  the Company's control.

  Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses

  Liabilities for unpaid losses, which are not discounted
  (except for certain workers' compensation liabilities), and
  LAE are determined using case-basis evaluations, statistical
  analyses and estimates for salvage and subrogation recoverable
  and represent estimates of the ultimate claim costs of all
  unpaid losses and LAE.  Liabilities include a provision for
  losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported.
  These estimates are subject to the effect of trends in future
  claim severity and frequency experience.  Adjustments to such
  estimates are made from time to time due to changes in such
  trends as well as changes in actual loss experience.  These
  adjustments are reflected in current earnings.

  The Company relies upon standard actuarial ultimate loss
  projection techniques to obtain estimates of liabilities for
  losses and LAE. These projections include the extrapolation of
  both losses paid and incurred by business line and accident
  year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation and
  claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based
  upon historical patterns.  In addition, methods based upon
  average loss costs, reported claim counts and pure premiums
  are reviewed in order to obtain a range of estimates for
  setting the reserve levels.  For further input, changes in
  operations in pertinent areas including underwriting
  standards, product mix, claims management and legal climate
  are periodically reviewed.

<TABLE>
  In the following table, the liability for losses and LAE of
  the Company, is reconciled for each of the three years ended
  December 31, 2000.  Included therein are current year data and
  prior year development.

</TABLE>

[S]
  The following table presents the development of balance sheet
  liabilities for 1990 through 2000 for the Company.  The
  liability line at the top of the table indicates the estimated
  liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance
  sheet date for each of the indicated years.  The middle
  section of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the
  previously recorded liability based on experience as of the
  end of each succeeding year.  As more information becomes
  available and claims are settled, the estimated liabilities
  are adjusted upward or downward with the effect of decreasing
  or increasing net income at the time of adjustment. The lower
  section of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with
  respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of
  each succeeding year

  The "cumulative deficiency" represents the aggregate change in
  the estimates over all prior years.  For example, the initial
  1990 liability estimate indicated on the table of $75,420,000
  has been re-estimated during the course of the succeeding ten
  years, resulting in a re-estimated liability at December 31,
  2000 of $85,129,000 or a deficiency of $9,709,000.  If the
  re-estimated liability were less than the liability initially
  established, a cumulative redundancy would be indicated.

  In evaluating this information it should be noted that each
  amount shown for "cumulative deficiency" includes the effects
  of all changes in amounts for prior periods.  For example, the
  amount of the deficiency related to losses settled in 1994,
  but incurred in 1990, will be included in the cumulative
  deficiency amount for 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993.  This table
  is not intended to and does not present accident or policy
  year loss and LAE development data.  Conditions and trends
  that have affected development of the liability in the past
  may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it would
  not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or
  deficiencies based on this table.

  experience, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis
  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this

  Item 2.         Properties

  The Group has entered into a twenty year lease agreement which
  expires in 2018, consisting of 286,510 square feet, in an
  office building located at 335 Adams Street in Brooklyn, New
  York, in which Leucadia has an equity interest.  The Group
  received certain incentives from both the City and State of
  New York in connection with this lease, which will be
  recognized over the term of the lease.

  Empire has subleased 133,140 square feet of the office space
  to its parent, Leucadia, at similar terms as in the original
  lease.  In 2000, Empire subleased an additional 64,340 square
  feet of the office space to the Board of Education of the City
  School District of the City of New York.  Both sublease
  agreements expire in 2018.

  The Group also conducts limited operations from branch offices
  located in Rochester, New York, Mineola, New York and Boston,
  Massachusetts.  The rental charged to the Company for these
  facilities is prorated in accordance with the pooling
  agreement described in "Pooling Agreement" under Item 1,
  herein.

  Item 3.         Legal Proceedings

  The Company is party to legal proceedings that are considered
  to be either ordinary, routine litigation or incidental to its
  business. Based on discussion with counsel, the Company does
  not believe that such litigation will have a material effect
  on its financial position, results of operations or cash
  flows.

  Item 4.         Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

  (c) Dividends
  The Company has paid no dividends on its common shares since
  1975.  The New York Insurance Law prohibits New York domiciled
  property and casualty companies from paying dividends except
  out of earned surplus.  Without the approval of the New York
  Insurance Department, no New York domestic property/ casualty
  insurer may declare or distribute any dividend to shareholders
  which, together with any dividends declared or distributed by
  it during  the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of
  (1) 10% of surplus  to policyholders as shown by its last
  statutory annual statement or (2) one hundred percent of
  adjusted net investment income during such period.  At
  December 31, 2000, $4,670,000 was available for distribution
  of dividends.  The Company does not presently anticipate
  paying dividends in the near future.

  Item 7.         Management's Discussion and Analysis of
          Financial Condition and Results of Operations
  The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the
  Company's financial condition, liquidity and capital resources
  and results of operations.  This analysis should be read in
  conjunction with the financial statements and related notes
  which appear elsewhere in this Report.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources

  In 2000 and 1999, net cash was used for operations as a result
  of a decrease in premiums written and the payment of claims.
  As discussed above, it is currently anticipated the Company's
  premiums will continue to decline while the Company runs off
  its claims liabilities.  This is expected to result in a
  continued net use of the Company's cash for operations over
  the next several years.

  At December 31, 2000 and 1999 the yield of the Company's fixed
  maturities portfolio was 6.4% and 6.5%, respectively, with an
  average maturity of 2.2 years and 2.6 years for 2000 and 1999,
  respectively.  Additionally, the Company maintains a
  diversified investment portfolio of securities, of which at
  December 31, 2000, approximately 66% of the fixed maturities
  portfolio was invested in issues of the U.S. Treasury and its
  governmental agencies with the remainder primarily invested in
  investment grade corporate and industrial issues.

  The Company maintains cash, short-term and readily marketable
  securities and anticipates that the cash flow from investment
  income, maturities and sales of short-term investments and
  fixed maturities will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated
  cash needs.  During 2000 and 1999, the Company sold certain
  securities at a net realized capital loss to meet short-term
  cash flow needs.  The Company does not presently anticipate
  paying dividends in the near future and believes it has
  sufficient capital to meet its currently anticipated level of
  operations.

  Results of Operations

  Net earned premium revenues of the Company were $30.9 million,
  $42.4 million and $67.5 million for the years ended December
  31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. While earned premiums
  declined in almost all lines of business during 2000 and 1999,
  the most significant reductions during 2000 were in assigned
  risk automobile ($4.4 million) and voluntary private passenger
  automobile ($4.4 million), and during 1999 were in assigned
  risk automobile ($7.3 million), voluntary private passenger
  automobile ($8.1 million) and commercial package policies
  ($3.7 million).  Effective January 1, 2000, all policy renewal
  obligations for assigned risk contracts were assigned to
  another insurance company. However, the Company remains liable
  for the claim settlement costs for assigned risk claims that
  occurred during the policy term.  The decline in voluntary
  private passenger automobile resulted from tighter
  underwriting standards, increased competition and the
  Company's decision in 1999 to no longer accept new policies
  from those agents who historically have had poor underwriting
  results.  The Company's termination of certain unprofitable
  agents also adversely affected premium volume in other lines
  of business.

  During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Group announced that it
  would no longer accept any new private passenger automobile
  policies from any agents.  Existing policies of private
  passenger automobile insurance will be either sold,
  non-renewed or cancelled in accordance with New York insurance
  law.  If this book of business is not sold, it is expected
  that the Group will continue to issue renewal policies over
  the next several years as required by applicable insurance
  law.  The Group also announced that all statutory automobile
  policies (public livery vehicles) would be non-renewed
  effective March 1, 2001, due to poor underwriting results.

  On March 1, 2001, the Group announced that, effective
  immediately, it would no longer issue any new (as compared to
  renewal) insurance policies and that it has filed plans of
  orderly withdrawal with the New York Insurance Department as
  required.  Existing commercial lines policies will be
  non-renewed or canceled in accordance with New York insurance
  law or replaced by Tower.  The Group will continue to be
  responsible for the remaining term of its existing policies
  and all claims incurred prior to the expiration of these
  policies.  For commercial lines, the Group will thereafter
  have no renewal obligations for those policies.  Under New
  York insurance law, the Group is obligated to offer renewals
  of homeowners, dwelling fire, personal insurance coverage and
  personal umbrella for a three-year policy period; however, the
  Tower Agreement provides that Tower must offer replacements
  for these policies.  The closing of the transaction is subject
  to the approval of the New York Insurance Department.

<PAGE>


  The NAIC has adopted model laws incorporating the concept of a
  "risk based capital" ("RBC") requirement for insurance companies.
  Generally, the RBC formula is designed to measure the adequacy
  of an insurer's statutory capital in relation to the risks
  inherent in its business.  The RBC formula is used by the
  states as an early warning tool to identify weakly capitalized
  companies for the purpose of initiating regulatory action.
  Although New York State has not adopted the RBC requirements
  for property and casualty insurance companies, New York does
  require that property and casualty insurers file the RBC
  information with the New York Insurance Department ("the
  Department").  The NAIC also has adopted various ratios for
  insurance companies which, in addition to the RBC ratio, are
  designed to serve as a tool to assist state regulators in
  screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance
  companies operating in their respective states. The Company
  and its parent had certain NAIC ratios outside of the
  acceptable range of results for the year ended December 31,
  2000.

  In 2001, the Department completed its fieldwork for its
  triennial examination of the statutory-basis financial
  statements of the Company and its parent as of December 31,
  1999 but has not as yet issued its report.  However, the
  Department has verbally informed the Company that its estimate
  of the Company's required loss and loss adjustment expense
  reserves as of December 31, 1999 was higher than the amount
  recorded by the Company.  The Department's estimate of loss
  and loss adjustment expense reserves for accident years 1999
  and prior is approximately $15,000,000 higher than the
  Company's recorded reserves for such accident years as of
  December 31, 2000.  The Company and its parent are currently
  discussing the results of the Department's reserve study with
  them, and are working to reconcile the differences between the
  two estimates.  Based on the Company's and its parent's recent
  discussions with the Department, and their decision to file
  plans of orderly withdrawal from all lines of business, as
  previously described, the Company believes that no material
  adverse action will be taken by the Department at this time.
  However, no assurance can be given that the Company and its
  parent will not be required to increase their reserves or that
  the Department will not take materially adverse regulatory
  action in the future.

  The Group is currently exploring its options for the future.
  Assuming the Tower Agreement is consummated, the Group will
  only have renewal obligations for remaining personal lines
  insurance (primarily automobile) not replaced by Tower, the
  remaining policy term of all existing policies and a claim
  run-off operation.  The Group may commence new property and
  casualty insurance operations if a new business model with an
  acceptable expense structure can be developed, enter into a
  joint venture with another property and casualty insurance
  operation, explore entering the claim services business or
  commence a liquidation.  There may be other options that the
  Company will explore, but no assurance can be given at this
  time as to what the ultimate plan will be.

The Company's combined ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were as
follows:

</TABLE>

  [S]
  The Company's combined ratios increased in 2000 primarily due
  to unfavorable loss reserve development from prior accident
  years, increased loss adjustment expenses for newly outsourced
  claims and adverse development in loss adjustment expenses.
  In addition, these ratios increased due to reduced service
  fees, higher 2000 accident year loss ratios, higher severance
  costs and overhead costs which, although lower, have not
  declined commensurate with the reduced premium volume.  The
  Company's combined ratios increased in 1999 primarily due to
  the reduction in premium volume at a rate greater than the
  reduction in net underwriting and other costs.  In addition,
  in 1999, the expense ratios were adversely affected by the
  reduction in service fees, increased expenditures related to
  the installation of new information systems, providing
  Internet access to agents and severance costs.  Included in
  the Company's results for 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $15.9
  million $6.0 million and $12.9 million respectively, for
  increases in estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses for
  prior accident years.

  During 2000, the Company experienced unfavorable development
  principally in the 1996 through 1999 accident years in the
  private passenger automobile line ($2.8 million), the
  commercial automobile line ($1.9 million), the assigned risk
  automobile line ($1.4 million) and the commercial package
  policies line ($4.5 million). In addition, the Company
  increased its estimate for loss adjustment expenses by $3.3
  million as a result of the decision to outsource a significant
  amount of claim handling functions in 2000.  Claim files for
  workers' compensation, automobile no-fault and automobile and
  other liability claims were outsourced at a cost greater than
  the reserves previously recorded to handle the claims
  internally.  The Group has outsourced almost two-thirds of its
  claims.  Currently, the Group is primarily handling complex
  claims, first party claims and certain automobile liability
  and general liability claims internally.  Complex claims
  generally consist of those that have potentially large
  settlement exposure and are not expected to settle quickly.
  The Company has also increased its reserve estimate for claims
  handled internally.

  During 1999, the Company experienced unfavorable development
  due to an increase in severity of 1998 accident year losses in
  the assigned risk automobile and voluntary private passenger
  automobile lines, and 1996 accident year losses in certain
  classes of the commercial automobile line.  As a result, the
  Company increased its reserves by $2.2 million for assigned
  risk automobile, $1.5 million for voluntary private passenger
  automobile and $1.4 million for commercial automobile lines.

  During 1998, the Company reviewed the adequacy of the reserves
  carried for its open claims' files, focusing on workers'
  compensation, commercial auto and other commercial liability
  lines of business.  As part of the review, substantially all
  open workers' compensation claim files were reviewed for every
  accident year up to and including 1998. Additionally, during
  1998, the Group reorganized the commercial auto claims
  department.  As part of this realignment, more complex claims
  files were reviewed by the most experienced claims examiners
  and assumptions regarding average claims severity and probable
  ultimate losses were revised.  Accordingly, reserves were
  strengthened by $3.9 million for workers' compensation, $4.2
  million for commercial automobile and $4.2 million for other
  commercial liability lines of business.

  As a consequence of its reserve increases, the Company has
  reduced premiums and pre-tax profits to recognize reinsurance
  premiums due for 1995 and prior years under retrospectively
  rated reinsurance agreements.  Such amounts totaled $1.4
  million, $1.4 million and $0.6 million  for the years ended
  December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The Company
  has not entered into retrospectively rated reinsurance
  agreements after 1995.

<PAGE>

  For all lines of property and casualty insurance business, the
  Company employs a variety of standard actuarial ultimate loss
  projection techniques, statistical analyses and case-basis
  evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses.  The
  actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses
  paid and incurred by business line and accident year and
  implicitly consider the impact of inflation and claims
  settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon
  historical patterns.  These estimates are performed quarterly
  and consider any changes in trends and actual loss experience.
   Any resulting change in the estimate of the liability for
  unpaid losses, including those discussed above, is reflected
  in current year earnings during the quarter the change in
  estimate is identified.

  The reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past
  experience is an appropriate basis for predicting future
  events.  The probable effects of current developments, trends
  and other relevant matters are also considered.  Since the
  establishment of loss reserves is affected by many factors,
  some of which are outside the Company's control or are
  affected by future conditions, reserving for property and
  casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process requiring
  the use of informed estimates and judgments.  As additional
  experience and other data become available and are reviewed,
  the Company's estimates and judgments may be revised.  While
  the effect of any such changes in estimates could be material
  to future results of operations, the Company does not expect
  such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity or
  financial condition.

  In management's judgment, information currently available has
  been appropriately considered in estimating the Company's loss
  reserves.  The Company will continue to evaluate the adequacy
  of its loss reserves on a quarterly basis, incorporating any
  future changes in trends and actual loss experience, and
  record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate.

  Investment income has decreased by approximately $1.0 million
  or 8.2% in 2000 and decreased by approximately $2.1 million,
  or 14.2% in 1999, primarily as a result of lower invested
  assets due to claim payments and a decrease in premiums
  written.  During 2000 and 1999, the Company had realized
  capital losses of $0.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively,
  principally due to the sale of fixed maturities to satisfy
  operating cash needs.  During 1998, the Company recorded $6.1
  million in realized capital gains principally on the sale of
  fixed maturities, primarily U.S. Treasury Notes.

  The combination of other underwriting expenses incurred and
  the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs
  reflected a decrease of $3.1 million or 16.4% in 2000 and
  approximately $2.2 million or 10.5% in 1999. The decrease in
  both 2000 and 1999 primarily related to the decline in premium
  revenue coupled with a reduction in operating expenses.  1998
  included increased expenses relating to the move of the
  Company's executive and administrative offices to Brooklyn,
  New York and higher underwriting costs offset in part by a
  $2.0 million pension curtailment gain.

  Due to the uncertainty of future taxable income necessary for
  realization of the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance
  has been provided as of December 31, 2000 on the total amount
  of the deferred tax asset.

  Impact of Inflation

  The Company, as well as the property and casualty insurance
  industry in general, is affected by inflation.  With respect
  to losses, the Company's claim severity is affected by the
  impact of inflation on the cost of automobile repair parts,
  medical costs  and  lost  wages.  The  costs  of  adjusting
  claims  and  other  underwriting  expenses  have  also  been
  affected by inflationary  pressures  on  salaries  and
  employee  benefits.  The Company receives rate increases based
  in part upon its experience  as  well  as the industry's
  experience.  Accordingly, premium increases generally follow
  the rate of inflation.

  Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
  Risk

  The following includes "forward-looking statements" that
  involve risks and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ
  materially from those projected in the forward-looking
  statements.

  The Company's market risk arises principally from interest
  rate risk related to its investment portfolio.  The Company
  does not enter into material derivative financial instrument
  transactions.

  The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as
  available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the
  balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
  reflected in shareholders' equity.  Included in the Company's
  investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which
  comprised approximately 77.1% of the Company's total
  investment portfolio at December 31, 2000.  These fixed income
  securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S.
  governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although
  limited investments in "non-rated" or rated less than
  investment grade securities have been made from time to time.
  The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed
  income securities was approximately 2.2 years at December 31,
  2000.  The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed
  income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will
  fall in value if market interest rates increase.  At December
  31, 1999, fixed income securities comprised approximately 80%
  of the Company's investment portfolio and had an estimated
  weighted average remaining life of 2.6 years.  A portion of
  the Company's invested assets represent an investment in a
  limited partnership which invests principally in convertible
  preferred stocks, convertible long-term debt securities,
  limited partnerships, and common stocks sold, but not yet
  purchased. Expected maturities will differ from contractual
  maturities because the borrowers may have the right to call or
  prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment
  penalties.  The Company manages the investment portfolio to
  preserve principal, maintain a high level of quality, comply
  with applicable insurance industry regulations and achieve an
  acceptable rate of return.  In addition, the Company considers
  the duration of its insurance reserves in comparison with that
  of its investments.

  (a) Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Toppi received no compensation from the
  Company.  Messrs. Scruggs and Toppi are compensated directly by
  Leucadia.

  The Company does not directly remunerate directors.  The
  directors of the Company and Empire who are not officers or
  employees of Empire and the Company were paid an annual
  retainer of  $5,000.  In addition, eligible directors receive
  $1,500 for each joint board meeting attended.  For attendance
  at a meeting of a committee of the joint board, such directors
  receive $1,500 per meeting.  In addition, each Chairperson of
  a committee is entitled to $500 per annum.  All fees paid to
  such directors are shared in accordance with the pooling
  agreement.

  In 2000, Mr. Toppi retired as Director, President and CEO of
  the Company and the Group.  He was succeeded by Mr. Scruggs
  who is President and CEO and a Director.

  In 1998, Mr. Richard G. Petitt retired as Director, Chairman
  of the Board, President and CEO of the Company and the Group.
  He was succeeded by Mr. Toppi as President and CEO and a
  Director.  Mr. Steinberg succeeded Mr. Petitt as Chairman of
  the Board.

  Pension Plan
  Effective January 1, 1999, Empire adopted a non-contributory
  defined contribution plan (the "Plan").  The contributions,
  ranging from 2% - 16% of employees' current pension eligible
  compensation, are based on the age and service of the
  employee.  These contributions accumulate for participants on
  a tax-deferred basis.  Participants direct the investment of
  their contributions to their accounts.  Empire contributed
  $682,000 and $1,145,000 to the Plan in 2000 and 1999,
  respectively.  In accordance with the pooling agreement, the
  Company is obligated to provide 30% of Empire's contributions
  to the Plan.

  Prior to January 1, 1999, pensions for officers and employees
  of the Company were provided under a non-contributory defined
  benefit pension plan ("prior pension plan").  Any employee was
  eligible for membership in the plan on January 1st or July 1st
  of any plan year after which they had completed one full year
  of service, consisting of a minimum of 1000 credited hours
  with Empire, provided they had attained the age of 21 years by
  or before such date.  Members of the prior plan received a
  basic pension if they worked until their normal retirement
  date, which was the last day of the month in which they
  attained 65 years of age with 5 years of, credited service.
  Any member in the active employ of Empire may have elected
  early retirement between 55 and 65.  A member electing early
  retirement must have had at least 10 years of service. A
  monthly average of total compensation received over the
  highest 5 consecutive plan or calendar years before retirement
  was taken to compute benefits as follows:

  1.30% of the first $833 per month of average pay, plus
  1.75% of average pay over $833 per month.

<PAGE>
  The sum of these two credits was multiplied by the years of
  credited service. The basic benefit amounts listed in the
  table below were not subject to any deduction for Social
  Security benefits or other offset amounts. The maximum benefit
  payable under the prior pension plan was $96,400 per year.
  Benefits accrued under the prior pension plan were frozen as
  of December 31, 1998.  The prior pension plan was merged with
  the Leucadia pension plan effective  January 1, 1999.

  As a result of the curtailment of the pension benefits in
  1998, the Group recognized a gain of $6,548,000.  In
  accordance with the pooling agreement, the Company's share of
  the curtailment gain was 30%.
<TABLE>

  The amounts set forth in the following table show estimated
  annual benefits upon retirement to which the Company
  contributed 30% of such cost through the pooling agreement.

  Salary Cap Restoration Plan

  In 1994, Empire established a Salary Cap Restoration Plan
  ("SCRP") for certain corporate officers.  Under the SCRP,
  Empire provided these officers with an additional benefit, to
  be paid in a lump-sum upon retirement, equal to the difference
  between the actuarially determined lump-sum benefits, as
  computed under the prior pension plan, of the officer's
  highest five year average compensation (not to exceed
  $320,000, adjusted for the cost-of-living) at retirement and
  the current Internal Revenue Service maximum compensation
  limit of $160,000. The SCRP was an unfunded plan.  Along with
  the prior pension plan, the benefits under SCRP were curtailed
  as of December 31, 1998.

  Employees' Savings Plan

  Empire sponsors an Employees' Savings Plan (the "Savings
  Plan"), under which each eligible employee may defer a portion
  of his or her annual compensation, subject to limitations.
  Empire contributes a matching amount, subject to certain
  limits. Empire matches contributions equal to 50% of an
  employee's contributions up to a maximum of 3% of the
  employee's salary.  Empire's contributions to the Savings Plan
  were, $294,000,  $452,000 and $420,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
  respectively. Under the pooling agreement, the Company is
  obligated to provide 30% of Empire's contributions to the
  Savings Plan.

  owner of a proportionate number of the shares of common stock
  of the Company beneficially owned by Leucadia through its
  subsidiaries, Empire and Baldwin Enterprises, Inc.

  in the index appearing under item 14(a)(1) of this Form 10-K
  present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
  position of Allcity Insurance Company and its subsidiary at
  December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
  the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with
  accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
  of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial
  statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
  14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K presents fairly, in all material
  respects, the information set forth therein when read in
  conjunction with the related consolidated financial
  statements.  These financial statements and the financial
  statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
  management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
  these financial statements and the financial statement
  schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of
  these statements in accordance with auditing standards
  generally accepted in the United States of America which
  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
  are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
  examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
  and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
  accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
  management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
  basis for our opinion.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  ALLCITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY

  NOTE 1-ORGANIZATION

  Allcity Insurance Company ("Allcity" or the "Company") is a
  property and casualty insurer and includes the results of its
  subsidiary, Empall Agency, Inc. ("Empall").  Empire Insurance
  Company ("Empire"), a property and casualty insurer owns
  approximately 84.6% of the outstanding common shares of the
  Company and 100% of the outstanding common shares of Centurion
  Insurance Company ("Centurion").  Empire's common shares are
  100% owned and controlled, through subsidiaries, by Leucadia
  National Corporation ("Leucadia").  Additionally, Leucadia
  indirectly owns an additional 6.7% of the outstanding  common
  shares of the Company.  The Company, Empire and Centurion are
  sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the Group.

  The property and casualty insurance business written by Empire
  and Allcity is subject to a pooling agreement under which
  premiums, losses, loss adjustment expenses and other
  underwriting expenses, net of reinsurance, are shared on the
  basis of 70% to Empire and 30% to Allcity.  The pooling
  percentages have been changed from time to time and may be
  changed in the future subject to New York Insurance Department
  approval.  Allcity has no employees of its own.  Empire
  provides administrative services and 30% of the related
  expenses are allocated to Allcity.

  Historically, the Group has specialized in commercial and
  personal property and casualty insurance business primarily in
  the New York metropolitan area.  The Group has offered
  insurance products for vehicles (including medallion and
  radio-controlled livery vehicles), general liability coverage,
  property coverage (including mercantile and multi-family
  residential real estate) and workers' compensation to
  commercial accounts and private passenger automobile and
  homeowners products to individuals.  The business of the Group
  is organized into three divisions: the Small Business
  Division, the Personal Lines Division and the Mid-Market
  Division.  Each of these divisions has separate management
  teams responsible for all underwriting decisions within their
  divisions with  the Small Business Division focusing on
  commercial package products for small businesses; the Personal
  Lines Division focusing on personal automobile and homeowners
  insurance; and the Mid-Market Division focusing on commercial
  automobile, commercial package and workers' compensation
  insurance for larger accounts. Based on the Company's net
  earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2000,
  approximately 39%, 43% and 18% of such premiums were for the
  Personal Lines, Mid-Market and Small Business lines of
  business, respectively.

  During the past several years, the Group has experienced poor
  underwriting results and adverse reserve development in all of
  its lines of business.  The Group has recently announced that
  it will no longer accept any applications for new insurance
  policies, has filed plans of orderly withdrawal with the New
  York Insurance Department, has entered into an agreement to
  sell its renewal rights to an unaffiliated insurance company
  and made arrangements with the unaffiliated insurance company
  to offer renewal policies in those lines of business (other
  than private passenger automobile insurance) where New York
  insurance law imposes a renewal obligation.  Assuming this
  agreement is consummated, the Group will only have renewal
  obligations for remaining personal lines insurance (primarily
  automobile) not replaced by the unaffiliated insurance
  company, the remaining policy term of all existing policies
  and a claim run-off operation.

  ALLCITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY

  NOTE   1-ORGANIZATION-CONTINUED
  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")
  has adopted model laws incorporating the concept of a "risk
  based capital" ("RBC") requirement for insurance companies.
  Generally, the RBC formula is designed to measure the adequacy
  of an insurer's statutory capital in relation to the risks
  inherent in its business.  The RBC formula is used by the
  states as an early warning tool to identify weakly capitalized
  companies for the purpose of initiating regulatory action.
  Although New York State has not adopted the RBC requirements
  for property and casualty insurance companies, New York does
  require that property and casualty insurers file the RBC
  information with the New York Insurance Department ("the
  Department").  The NAIC also has adopted various ratios for
  insurance companies which, in addition to the RBC ratio, are
  designed to serve as a tool to assist state regulators in
  screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance
  companies operating in their respective states. The Company
  and its parent had certain NAIC ratios outside of the
  acceptable range of results for the year ended December 31,
  2000.

  In 2001, the Department completed its fieldwork for its
  triennial examination of the statutory-basis financial
  statements of the Company and its parent as of December 31,
  1999 but has not as yet issued its report.  However, the
  Department has verbally informed the Company that its estimate
  of the Company's required loss and loss adjustment expense
  reserves as of December 31, 1999 was higher than the amount
  recorded by the Company.  The Department's estimate of loss
  and loss adjustment expense reserves for accident years 1999
  and prior is approximately $15,000,000 higher than the
  Company's recorded reserves for such accident years as of
  December 31, 2000.  The Company and its parent are currently
  discussing the results of the Department's reserve study with
  them, and are working to reconcile the differences between the
  two estimates.  Based on the Company's and its parent's recent
  discussions with the Department, and their decision to file
  plans of orderly withdrawal from all lines of business, as
  previously described, the Company believes that no material
  adverse action will be taken by the Department at this time.
  However, no assurance can be given that the Company and its
  parent will not be required to increase their reserves or that
  the Department will not take materially adverse regulatory
  action in the future.

  The Group is currently exploring its options for the future.
  The Group may commence new property and casualty insurance
  operations if a new business model with an acceptable expense
  structure can be developed, enter into a joint venture with
  another property and casualty insurance operation, explore
  entering the claim services business or commence a
  liquidation.  There may be other options that the Company will
  explore, but no assurance can be given at this time as to what
  the ultimate plan will be.

  The Company and Empire are licensed to transact insurance in
  the State of New York with Empire being additionally licensed
  in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire and New
  Jersey. Based on direct premiums written, approximately 6%, 6%
  and 4% of the property and casualty business written by the
  Group were from sources outside New York State for the years
  ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
  ALLCITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTE   1-ORGANIZATION-CONTINUED
  The Company and Empire distributed their products through
  seven general agents, one of which was an Empire subsidiary,
  and independent agents and brokers. Effective October 3, 2000,
  Empire's wholly owned general agent sold its book of business
  to an unrelated party. Empire's wholly-owned general agent was
  its largest producer and generated approximately 8%, 12% and
  12% of its total earned premium volume for the years ended
  December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
  the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Empall.  The
  preparation of financial statements in conformity with
  generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires
  management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
  reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures
  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
  financial statements.   Actual results could differ from those
  estimates.

  NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Investments: At acquisition, marketable debt and equity
  securities  are designated as either (i) "held to maturity"
  and carried at amortized cost, (ii) "trading" and carried at
  estimated fair value with differences between cost and
  estimated fair value reflected in results of operations or
  (iii) "available for sale" and carried at estimated fair
  value, with differences between cost and estimated fair value
  being reflected as a separate component of shareholders'
  equity,  net of taxes. Other invested assets, which are
  designated as trading securities, represent an investment in a
  limited partnership which invests principally in convertible
  preferred stocks, convertible long-term debt securities,
  limited partnerships, and common stocks sold, but not yet
  purchased. Short-term investments are carried at cost which
  approximates fair value.  Estimated fair values are
  principally based on quoted market prices.

  At December 31, 2000 and 1999, investments in fixed maturities
  on deposit with the New York Insurance Department, which the
  Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity, are
  classified as "Investments held to maturity".  Investment
  income is reported when earned.

  Net securities gains or losses on the sales of investments are
  determined on a specific identification basis. Investments
  with an impairment in value considered to be other than
  temporary are written down to estimated net realizable values.

  Unearned Premiums: Unearned premiums have been calculated
  predominantly using the daily pro rata method.

  Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses: Liabilities for
  unpaid losses, which are not discounted (except for certain
  workers' compensation liabilities), and loss adjustment
  expenses ("LAE") are determined using case-basis evaluations,
  statistical analyses for losses incurred but not reported and
  estimates for salvage and subrogation recoverable and
  represent estimates of the ultimate claim costs of all unpaid
  losses and LAE.  Liabilities include a provision for losses
  that have occurred but have not yet been reported.  These
  estimates are subject to the effect of trends in future claim
  severity and frequency experience.  Adjustments to such
  estimates are made from time to time due to changes in such
  trends as well as changes in actual loss experience. These
  adjustments are reflected in current earnings.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
  ALLCITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY

  NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES-CONTINUED

  Reinsurance: Unpaid losses, unpaid loss adjustment expenses
  and unearned premiums are stated gross of reinsurance ceded.
  Premiums written and earned, losses and LAE paid and incurred,
  and other underwriting expenses are stated net of reinsurance
  ceded.

  Pension Cost: Empire funds actuarially determined pension
  costs as currently accrued; 30% of such pension costs are
  allocated to the Company.

  Policy Acquisition Costs: Policy acquisition costs, which
  consist of  commissions, premium taxes and certain other
  underwriting expenses (net of reinsurance allowances), are
  deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of the related
  policies.  Deferred policy acquisition costs are limited to
  their net realizable value after consideration of investment
  income on the related premium. If recoverability of such costs
  from future premiums and related investment income is not
  anticipated, the amounts not considered recoverable are
  charged to operations.

  Participating Policies: Participating business on workers'
  compensation lines constitutes approximately 1.3% of the
  Company's policies in force and net premiums written.  Amounts
  transferred to the participating policyholders' funds are
  determined by means of specific identification based upon
  premium volume and loss experience.  The amount of dividends
  to be paid to participating policyholders is approved
  quarterly by the Board of Directors. The amount of
  policyholders' dividends paid on participating policies was
  $59,000  $133,000 and $212,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
  respectively.  Unpaid dividends to participating policyholders
  are included as a liability in the consolidated balance
  sheets.

  Servicing Arrangements: Service fee income from assigned risk
  business acquired through contractual arrangements with other
  insurance companies was recognized as revenue and earned over
  the life of the covered policies on a monthly pro-rata method.

  Service fee income for the administrative services, including
  underwriting, policy issuance, premium collection and claims
  services, provided to the New York Public Auto Pool (the
  "NYPAP") was recorded as a reduction to other underwriting and
  loss adjustment expenses and is earned over the life of the
  policies issued.  The premiums and losses processed by the
  Company on behalf of the NYPAP, which are not reflected in the
  consolidated financial statements for the years ended December
  31, are as follows (in thousands):

                                  2000       1999       1998
  Premiums Earned               $   -     $   -       $ 4,091
  Losses Incurred                  231     (12,972)    23,543
  Unpaid Losses                 21,781      32,250     70,469

  The premiums, losses and expenses of the business for which
  the Company provides administrative services are reflected on
  the financial statements of those insurance companies,
  including the Company, in New York State which are required to
  participate in the NYPAP.  In its role as a servicing carrier,
  the Company is liable only for the loss adjustment expenses
  which are incurred to adjust and settle the claims processed
  on behalf of the NYPAP. Liabilities for these loss adjustment
  expenses are determined using case basis evaluations and
  statistical analyses.

  ALLCITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY

  NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES-CONTINUED

  Federal Income Taxes: The Company uses the liability method in
  providing for income taxes.  Under the liability method,
  deferred income taxes are provided at the enacted tax rates
  for differences between the financial statement carrying
  amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for net
  operating loss carryforwards.  A valuation allowance is
  provided if tax loss carryforwards and deferred tax benefits
  are not considered more likely than not to be realized.

  Earnings Per Share: Earnings per share ("EPS") are based on
  the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
  There were no outstanding common stock equivalents during
  2000, 1999 and 1998 and therefore, basic and diluted EPS are
  the same.

  New Pronouncements: In June 1999, the Financial Accounting
  Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 137,
  "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
  - Deferral of the Effective date of FASB Statement No. 133
  ("SFAS 133")", which will be effective for fiscal years
  beginning after June 15, 2000.  Under SFAS 133, the Company
  will have to reflect derivative financial instruments at fair
  value.  The Company has reviewed the impact of the
  implementation of SFAS 133 and does not expect it to have a
  material effect on the Company's financial position or results
  of operations.

  Presentation: Certain prior year amounts have been
  reclassified to conform with the 2000 presentation.

  NOTE 3-SURPLUS NOTE
  The Company issued a surplus note to Empire in 1980.  The
  surplus note provides, among other things, for interest to be
  accrued on the principal of the note based on a bank's prime
  rate at the end of the current calendar quarter.  Neither the
  principal amount of the surplus note nor the accrued interest
  may be paid, in whole or in part, without the consent of the
  Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York
  ("Superintendent") and must be repaid, in whole or in part,
  when so ordered by the Superintendent

  The Company has paid no dividends on its common shares since
  1975.  The New York Insurance Law prohibits New York domiciled
  property and casualty companies from paying dividends except
  out of earned surplus.  Without the approval of the New York
  Insurance Department, no New York domestic property/casualty
  insurer may declare or distribute any dividend to shareholders
  which, together with any dividends declared or distributed by
  it during the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of
  (1) 10% of surplus to policyholders as shown by its last
  statutory annual statement or (2) one hundred percent of
  adjusted net investment income during such period.  At
  December 31, 2000, $4,670,000 was available for distribution
  of dividends. The Company does not presently anticipate paying
  dividends in the near future.

  NOTE 5-STATUTORY INFORMATION-CONTINUED

  In 1998, the National Association of Insurance Comissioners
  ("NAIC") adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
  Principles ("Codification"), which replaces the current
  Accounting Practices and Procedures manual as the NAIC's
  primary guidance on statutory accounting as of January 1,
  2001. The Codification provides guidance for areas where
  statutory accounting has been silent and changes current
  statutory accounting in some areas. The New York Insurance
  Department recently adopted the Codification guidance
  (Regulation 172), effective January 1, 2001, but did not adopt
  several key provisions of the guidance.  The Company will
  reflect the cumulative effect of the Codification guidance in
  its statutory financial statements as a direct adjustment to
  statutory surplus for the quarter ending March 31, 2001, to be
  filed with the New York Insurance Department by May 15, 2001.
  The Company is in the process of determining the potential
  effects of the codification.

  NOTE 7-UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE

  The Company has relied upon standard actuarial ultimate loss
  projection techniques to obtain estimates of liabilities for
  losses and LAE.  These projections include the extrapolation
  of both losses paid and incurred by business line and accident
  year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation and
  claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based
  upon historical patterns.  In addition, methods based upon
  average loss costs, reported claim counts and pure premiums
  are reviewed in order to obtain a range of estimates for
  setting the reserve levels.  For further input, changes in
  operations in pertinent areas including underwriting
  standards, product mix, claims management and legal climate
  are periodically reviewed.

  In the following table, the liability for losses and LAE are
  reconciled for the three years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
  and 1998. Included therein are current year data and prior
  year development.

  During 2000, the Company experienced unfavorable development
  principally in the 1996 through 1999 accident years in the
  private passenger automobile line ($2.8 million), the
  commercial automobile line ($1.9 million), the assigned risk
  automobile line ($1.4 million) and the commercial package
  policies line ($4.5 million). In addition, the Company
  increased its estimate for loss adjustment expenses by $3.3
  million as a result of the decision to outsource a significant
  amount of claim handling functions in 2000.  Claim files for
  workers' compensation, automobile no-fault and automobile and
  other liability claims were outsourced at a cost greater than
  the reserves previously recorded to handle the claims
  internally.  The Group has outsourced almost two-thirds of its
  claims.  Currently, the Group is primarily handling complex
  claims, first party claims and certain automobile liability
  and general liability claims internally.  Complex claims
  generally consist of those that have potentially large
  settlement exposure and are not expected to settle quickly.
  The Company has also increased its reserve estimate for claims
  handled internally.

  ALLCITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY

  NOTE 7-UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE-CONTINUED

  During 1999, the Company experienced unfavorable development
  due to an increase in severity of 1998 accident year losses in
  the assigned risk automobile and voluntary private passenger
  automobile lines, and 1996 accident year losses in certain
  classes of the commercial automobile line.  As a result, the
  Company increased its reserves by $2.2 million for assigned
  risk automobile, $1.5 million for voluntary private passenger
  automobile and $1.4 million for commercial automobile lines.

  During 1998, the Company reviewed the adequacy of the reserves
  carried for its open claims' files, focusing on workers'
  compensation, commercial auto and other commercial liability
  lines of business.  As part of the review, substantially all
  open workers' compensation claim files were reviewed for every
  accident year up to and including 1998. Additionally, during
  1998, the Group reorganized the commercial auto claims
  department.  As part of this realignment, more complex claims
  files were reviewed by the most experienced claims examiners
  and assumptions regarding average claims severity and probable
  ultimate losses were revised.  Accordingly, reserves were
  strengthened by $3.9 million for workers' compensation, $4.2
  million for commercial automobile and $4.2 million for other
  commercial liability lines of business.

  NOTE 8-REINSURANCE
  The Company has purchased annuities with various life insurance
  companies for a number of settled claims.  The claimants have been
  designated as payees; however, the Company has a contingent
  liability of approximately $5.0 million which represents the
  aggregate amount of settlements with the claimants, in the event of
  the failure of the various life insurance companies to perform.

  The Company has obtained reinsurance coverage to reduce its
  risk of and exposure to large insurance claims and
  catastrophes.  The Company's maximum retained limit for all
  lines of business was $0.3 million for 2000 and 1999. The
  Company's maximum retained limit for 1998 was $0.5 million for
  workers' compensation and $0.3 million for other property and
  casualty lines of business.  Additionally,  the Company has
  entered into a property catastrophe excess of loss treaty  to
  protect against certain losses. Its retention of lower level
  losses under this treaty is $7.5 million for 2001, and was
  $7.5 million for 2000, 1999 and 1998.  Due to the geographic
  concentration of its business, the Company believes
  hurricanes, windstorms and civil disturbances are its most
  significant exposures to catastrophic losses. Computer
  modeling programs provided by independent consultants are used
  to estimate exposure to such losses.

  Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer
  from its primary liability for the full amount of the policy
  liability, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the
  insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded. The Company's
  reinsurance generally has been placed with certain of the
  largest reinsurance companies, including (with their
  respective A.M Best & Co. ratings) General Reinsurance
  Corporation (A++) and Zurich Reinsurance (NA), Inc. (A+). The
  Company believes its reinsurers to be financially capable of
  meeting their respective obligations.  However, to the extent
  that any reinsuring company is unable to meet its obligations,
  the Company would be liable for the reinsured risks.  The
  Company has established reserves, which the Company believes
  are adequate, for any nonrecoverable reinsurance.

  NOTE 9-FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

  The Company has been included in the consolidated federal
  income tax returns of Leucadia since 1993.  Under the terms of
  the tax sharing agreement between Leucadia and the Company,
  the Company computes its tax provision on a separate return
  basis and is either charged its share of federal income tax
  resulting from its taxable income or is credited for  tax
  benefits resulting from its losses to the extent it could use
  the losses on a separate return basis.

  NOTE 9-FEDERAL INCOME TAXES-CONTINUED

  Due to the Company's recent announcement that it will no
  longer accept any applications for new insurance policies and
  its having entered into an agreement to sell its renewal
  rights, there is uncertainty as to having future taxable
  income necessary for realization of the deferred tax asset.
  Accordingly, a valuation allowance was provided as of December
  31, 2000 for the total amount of the deferred tax asset.

  NOTE 10-PENSION PLAN AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

  Effective January 1, 1999, Empire adopted a non-contributory
  defined contribution plan.  The contributions, ranging from 2%
  - 16% of employees' current pension eligible compensation, are
  based on age and service life of the employee.  These
  contributions accumulate for participants on a tax-deferred
  basis.  Participants direct the investment of the
  contributions to their accounts. In accordance with the
  pooling agreement, the Company shared 30% of the amount
  contributed by the Group to the Plan ($682,000 and $1,145,000
  in 2000 and 1999, respectively).

  Prior to January 1, 1999, Empire had a trusteed
  non-contributory defined benefit pension plan ("prior pension
  plan") covering substantially all employees.  The benefits
  were based on years of credited service and the employees'
  highest compensation during any five consecutive plan or
  calendar years before retirement.  Empire's policy was to fund
  pension costs on a current basis using an aggregate method.

  Benefits accrued under the prior pension plan were  frozen as
  of  December 31, 1998.  The prior pension plan was merged with
  the   Leucadia plan   effective  January 1, 1999. As a result
  of the curtailment of the pension benefits in 1998, the Group
  recognized a gain of $6,548,000. In accordance with the
  pooling agreement, the Company's share of prepaid pension and
  net periodic pension cost is 30% of the amounts reflected
  above.

  Empire provides certain health care and life insurance
  benefits for retired employees.  During 1996, Empire amended
  the eligibility requirement to only those employees who had at
  least ten years of service and were at least 50 years of age
  as of October 1, 1996.  Prior to this amendment, substantially
  all of Empire's employees were eligible for such benefits if
  they reached normal or early retirement age while still
  working for Empire. As a result of this amendment, the
  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by
  approximately $7,602,000 which has been amortized over three
  years. Those benefits are provided through an insurance
  company whose premiums are based on the cost of benefits paid
  during the year.

  NOTE 10-PENSION PLAN AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS-CONTINUED

  In accordance with the pooling agreement, the Company's share
  of accrued postretirement benefit cost and net periodic
  postretirement benefit income  is 30% of the amounts reflected
  above and is included in other liabilities.  In determining
  the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December
  31, 2000 and 1999, Empire utilized discount rates of 7.5% and
  8%, respectively. The assumed health care cost trend rates
  used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit
  obligation were 10% for 2000 declining to an ultimate rate of
  5% by 2010.  If the health care cost trend rates were
  increased by 1%, the accumulated postretirement benefit
  obligation as of December 31, 2000 would have increased by
  approximately $442,000 before the effects of the pooling
  agreement.  If the health care cost trend rates were decreased
  by 1%, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
  December 31, 2000 would have decreased by approximately
  $382,000 before the effects of the pooling agreement. The
  effect of a 1% increase or decrease on the estimated aggregate
  of service and interest cost for 2000, 1999 and 1998 would be
  immaterial.

  In 1994, Empire established a Salary Cap Restoration Plan
  ("SCRP") for certain corporate officers.  Under the SCRP,
  Empire provided these officers with an additional benefit, to
  be paid in a lump-sum upon retirement, equal to the difference
  between the actuarially determined lump-sum benefits, as
  computed under the prior pension plan, of the officer's
  highest five year average compensation (not to exceed
  $320,000, adjusted for the cost of living) at retirement and
  the current Internal Revenue Service maximum compensation
  limit of $160,000.  The SCRP is an unfunded plan. In 2000,
  1999 and 1998 Empire expensed $0, $98,000 and $74,000,
  respectively.  Along with the prior plan, the benefits under
  SCRP were curtailed as of December 31, 1998.  Under the
  pooling arrangement, the Company is obligated to pay 30% of
  the cost of the SCRP.

  Empire sponsors an Employees' Savings Plan (the "Savings
  Plan"), under which each eligible employee may defer a portion
  of their annual compensation, subject to certain limits.
  Empire matches contributions equal to 50% of the employee's
  contributions up to a maximum of 3% of the employee's salary.
  A participant may also contribute, from after-tax dollars, an
  amount, not to exceed 10% of annual compensation. Empire's
  contributions to the Savings Plan were $294,000, $452,000 and
  $420,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Under the
  pooling agreement, the Company is obligated to provide 30% of
  Empire's contributions to the Savings Plan.

  NOTE 11-LEASES

  The Group has entered into a twenty year lease agreement which
  expires in 2018, consisting of 286,510 square feet, in an
  office building located at 335 Adams Street in Brooklyn, New
  York, in which Leucadia has an equity interest.  The Group
  received certain incentives from both the City and State of
  New York in connection with this lease, which will be
  recognized over the term of the lease.

  Empire has subleased four floors consisting of 133,140 square
  feet of the office space to its parent, Leucadia, at similar
  terms as are in the original lease.  An additional two floors
  consisting of 64,340 square feet have been subleased to the
  Board of Education of the City School District of the City of
  New York.

  Empire guaranteed the payment of lease rentals by a
  wholly-owned subsidiary which relocated its offices in 1998 to
  the new office building with Empire.  In accordance with the
  guarantee, in 1998, $2.0 million of a $2.3 million liability
  for lease abandonment costs established by Empire in 1997 was
  reversed upon release by the landlord from its obligation. The
  remainder was paid in 1999. Under the pooling agreement, the
  Company was obligated for 30% of this transaction.
