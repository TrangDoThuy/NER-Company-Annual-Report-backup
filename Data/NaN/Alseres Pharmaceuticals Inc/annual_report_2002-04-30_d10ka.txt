Company's directors attended 100% of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board
and of all committees on which he was a member held during the year except for
Dr. Langer, who attended 4 of the 6 meetings of the Board. The standing

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

Annual Retainers

     Directors who are not employees of the Company ("Non-Employee Directors")
receive cash compensation in the amount of $1,000 per meeting attended in person
and $500 per meeting attended telephonically, although all


                                       4

<PAGE>

directors are reimbursed for ordinary and reasonable expenses of attending any
board or committee meetings. Non-Employee Directors will receive the same cash
compensation amount per meeting attended in 2002. In addition, Non-Employee
Directors were compensated in fiscal 2001 with an annual retainer with a value
of $5,000 and will receive the same amount in fiscal 2002. Currently, the
annual retainer is not paid in cash but is paid to the Non-Employee Directors
through options to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock pursuant to
the 1990 Plan, valued as described below. Each Non-Employee Director elected at
an annual meeting of stockholders of the Company is automatically granted
options on the thirteenth trading day after the date of such annual meeting
(the "Retainer Grant Date") to purchase a number of shares of the Company equal
to the lesser of (a) 2,500 shares and (b) the quotient of the value of the
annual retainer for service as a Non-Employee Director of the Company and 80%
of the average of the fair market value of a share of the Company's Common
Stock on the ten trading days following the third trading day after the date of
such annual meeting of stockholders. If the number of shares of the Company's
Common Stock calculated pursuant to clause (b) above exceeds 2,500 shares, each
Non-Employee Director will automatically receive on the Retainer Grant Date, in
addition to options to purchase 2,500 shares of the Company's common stock, a
cash payment equal to the remaining portion of the value of the annual retainer
not provided for by the grant of such options. Additionally, pursuant to the
Company's Stock Option plans, Dr. Bier, Dr. Langer, Dr. Lieberman, Mr. Palmer
and Mr. Weisman received discretionary grants of options to purchase 110,000,
68,000 95,000, 95,000, and 58,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock,
respectively, in fiscal 2001. Each director who serves as Chairman of a
committee of the Board receives an annual retainer of $1,000. The Chairmen of
the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Press Release Review
Committee who received this annual retainer in fiscal 2001 were Mr. Palmer, Dr.
Lieberman, and Dr. Bier respectively. There was not a Chairman of the Press
Release Review Committee during 2001. Dr. Langer is also a member of the
Company's Scientific Advisory Board pursuant to which the Company paid Dr.
Langer consulting fees totaling approximately $53,000 in 2001.

     The options granted to Non-Employee Directors pursuant to the annual
retainer described above are exercisable at a per share price of 20% of the
average fair market value per share of the Company's Common Stock used to
calculate such grant. The options become exercisable as to 75% of the shares of
Common Stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of such options six months
after the date of grant and as to 100% of such shares, on the later of six
months after the date of grant and December 31 of the year in which the grant is
made. The options generally terminate ten years after the date of grant.

     The options granted to the Non-Employee Directors pursuant to the
discretionary grant in 2001 are exercisable as follows: 50% exercisable upon
issuance; 75% exercisable as of the first anniversary date; 100% exercisable as
of the second anniversary date. These options terminate in 2011.

New Director Options

     Each person who is elected or appointed a Non-Employee Director for the
first time automatically upon such election or appointment (the "Automatic Grant
Date") will be granted an option to purchase 7,500 shares of the Company's
Common Stock ("New Director Options"). The exercise price of any New Director
Options granted under the 1990 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market
value of shares of the Company's Common Stock subject thereto on the Automatic
Grant Date. Subject to provisions regarding expiration and termination of
options, New Director Options become exercisable as to 20% of the shares of the
Company's Common Stock subject thereto on the Automatic Grant Date and become
exercisable as to an additional 20% of the shares of the Company's Common Stock
issuable upon exercise thereof on each of the first, second, third and fourth
anniversaries of such Automatic Grant Date. New Director Options terminate ten
years after the date of grant.
