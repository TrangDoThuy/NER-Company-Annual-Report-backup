<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>General</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America Service Group Inc. (&#147;ASG&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;), through its subsidiaries Prison Health
Services, Inc. (&#147;PHS&#148;), EMSA Limited Partnership (&#147;EMSA&#148;), Correctional Health Services, LLC
(&#147;CHS&#148;), Prison Health Services of Indiana, LLC and Secure Pharmacy Plus, LLC (&#147;SPP&#148;), contracts to
provide managed healthcare services, including the distribution of pharmaceuticals, to over 360
correctional facilities throughout the United States. The Company is the leading non-governmental
provider of correctional healthcare and pharmacy services in the United States.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASG was incorporated in 1990 as a holding company for PHS. Unless the context otherwise
requires, the terms &#147;ASG&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148; refer to ASG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
ASG&#146;s executive offices are located at 105 Westpark Drive, Suite&nbsp;200, Brentwood, Tennessee 37027.
Its telephone number is (615)&nbsp;373-3100.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Correctional Healthcare Services</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies to provide healthcare
services to inmates of prisons and jails. The Company&#146;s revenues from correctional healthcare
services are generated primarily by payments from governmental entities, none of which are
dependent on third party payment sources. The Company provides a wide range of on-site healthcare
programs, as well as off-site hospitalization and specialty outpatient care. The hospitalization
and specialty outpatient care is performed through arrangements with independent doctors and local
hospitals. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, revenues from correctional healthcare services
accounted for 93.8% of the Company&#146;s healthcare revenues from continuing operations and
discontinued operations combined. Required financial information
related to this business segment is set forth in Note 24 of the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth information regarding the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare and
pharmacy contracts.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s target correctional market consists of state prisons and county and local
jails. A prison is a facility in which an inmate is incarcerated for an extended period of time
(typically one year or longer). A jail is a facility in which the inmate is held for a shorter
period of time, often while awaiting trial or sentencing. The higher inmate turnover in jails
requires that healthcare be provided to a much larger number of individual inmates over time and
includes the costs associated with stabilizing and treating whatever health conditions or injuries
are present at the time of initial incarceration. Conversely, the costs of chronic healthcare
requirements are greater with respect to state prison contracts. State prison contracts often cover
a larger number of facilities and often have longer terms than jail contracts<B>.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Services Provided. </I>Generally, the Company&#146;s obligation to provide medical services to a
particular inmate begins upon the inmate&#146;s booking into the correctional facility and ends upon the
inmate&#146;s release. In order to reduce costs and provide better care, emphasis is placed upon early
identification of serious injuries or illnesses so that prompt and clinically-effective treatment
is commenced.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided on-site include physical and mental health screening upon intake.
Screening includes the compilation of the inmate&#146;s health history and the identification of any
current, chronic or acute healthcare needs. After initial screening, services provided may include
regular physical and dental screening and care, psychiatric care, OB-GYN screening and care and
diagnostic testing. Hospitalization is provided off-site at acute-care hospitals. Sick call is
regularly conducted and physicians, nurse practitioners, physicians&#146; assistants and others are also
involved in the delivery of care on a regular basis. Necessary medications are administered by
clinical staff.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided off-site include specialty outpatient diagnostic testing and care,
emergency room care, surgery and hospitalization. In addition, the Company provides administrative
support services on-site, at regional offices and at the Company&#146;s headquarters. Administrative
support services include program management, maintenance of on-site medical records and employee
recruitment, scheduling, continuing education and quality assurance, medical audits, credentialing,
and clinical program development activities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Company&#146;s correctional contracts require it to staff the facilities it serves with
nurses 24 hours a day. Doctors at the facilities have regular hours and are generally available on
call. In addition, dentists, psychiatrists and other specialists are available on a routine basis
at facilities where correctional contracts cover such services. The Company enters into contractual
arrangements with independent doctors and local hospitals with respect to more significant off-site
procedures and hospitalization.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (&#147;NCCHC&#148;) and the American Correctional
Association (&#147;ACA&#148;) set standards for the correctional healthcare industry and offers accreditation
to facilities that meet its standards. These standards provide specific guidance related to a
service provider&#146;s operations including administration, personnel, support services such as
hospital care, regular services such as sick call, records management and medical and legal issues.
Accreditation with NCCHC and ACA standards is voluntary and includes many other aspects of the
operation of the correctional facility other than the healthcare component. As such, not all of the
Company&#146;s clients seek this accreditation. For those clients that do desire such accreditation, the Company has a
100% success rate of obtaining and maintaining accreditation with these organizations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
NCCHC, an independent not-for-profit organization initially formed by the American Medical Association,
was established to improve the quality of health care in jails, prisons, and juvenile confinement
facilities. NCCHC offers a voluntary health services accreditation program, through external peer
review to determine whether correctional institutions meet certain standards in their provision of
health services. NCCHC renders a professional judgment and assists in the improvement of services
provided. The ACA, an independent not-for-profit organization, was established to develop
uniformity and industry standards for the operation of correctional facilities and the provision of
inmate care. Accreditation involves an extensive audit and compliance procedure, and is generally
granted for a three-year period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contract Provisions. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions typically fall
into one of three general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee. For fixed
fee contracts, the Company&#146;s revenues are based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service
contract. The Company&#146;s revenues for population-based contracts are based either on a fixed fee
adjusted using a per diem rate for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population
levels or on a per diem rate times the average or actual inmate population for the period of
service. For cost plus fee contracts, the Company&#146;s revenues are based on actual expenses incurred
during the service period plus a contractual fee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed fee based upon the regional medical
care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts that extend beyond one year, the
Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of the Company&#146;s costs of services when
bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. The Company often bears the risk of
increased or unexpected costs, which could result in reduced profits or cause it to sustain losses
when costs are higher than projected and increased profits when costs are lower than projected.
Certain contracts also contain financial penalties when performance or staffing criteria are not
achieved.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a portion of the
Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in certain of the
Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools for off-site expenses, stop loss provisions, cost plus
fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of off-site service costs. Pharmacy
expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically under the
terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue under the contract increases to offset increases in
specified cost categories such as off-site expenses or pharmaceutical costs. While such provisions
serve to mitigate the Company&#146;s exposure to losses resulting from cost fluctuations in the
specified cost categories, the Company will still experience variances in its margin percentage on
these contracts as the additional revenue under these contract provisions is typically equal to the
additional costs incurred by the Company. Many contracts contain termination clause provisions
which allow the Company to terminate the contract under agreed-upon notice periods. The ability to
terminate a contract serves to mitigate the Company&#146;s risk of increasing costs of services being
provided.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts accounting for approximately 28% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services
revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 contain no limits on the
Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to off-site

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">expenses, catastrophic illnesses or injuries to inmates. However, less than 1% of the
Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing operations for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 results from contracts where the Company is fully at risk for increases in these
costs and the contract has longer than one year remaining without termination provisions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When preparing bid proposals, the Company estimates the extent of its exposure to cost
increases, severe individual cases and catastrophic events and attempts to compensate for its
exposure in the pricing of its bids. The Company&#146;s management has experience in evaluating these
risks for bidding purposes and maintains an extensive database of historical experience.
Nonetheless, increased or unexpected costs against which the Company is not protected could render
a contract unprofitable. In an effort to manage risk under such contracts, the Company maintains
stop loss insurance from an unaffiliated insurer covering 100% of its exposure with respect to
catastrophic illnesses or injuries for annual amounts in excess of $500,000 per inmate up to an
annual cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate and a lifetime cap of $2.0&nbsp;million per inmate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average length of a contract for services is one to three years, with subsequent renewal
options. In general, contracts may be terminated by the governmental agency, and often by the
Company as well, without cause at any time upon proper notice. The required notice period for such
contracts ranges from one day to one year, but is typically between 90 and 120&nbsp;days. Governmental
agencies may be subject to political or financial influences that could lead to termination of a
contract through no fault of the Company. As with other governmental contracts, the Company&#146;s
contracts are subject to adequate budgeting and appropriation of funds by the governing legislature
or administrative body.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Administrative Systems. </I>The Company has centralized its administrative systems in order to
enhance economies of scale and to provide management with accurate, up-to-date field data for
forecasting purposes. These systems also enable the Company to refine its bids and help the Company
reduce the costs associated with the delivery of consistent healthcare.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a utilization review system to monitor the extent and duration of most
healthcare services required by inmates on an inpatient and outpatient basis. The current automated
utilization review program is an integral part of the services provided at each facility. The
system is designed to ensure that the medical care rendered is medically necessary and is provided
safely in a clinically appropriate setting while maintaining traditional standards of quality of
care. The system provides for determinations of medical necessity by medical professionals through
a process of pre-authorization and concurrent review of the appropriateness of any hospital stay.
The system seeks to identify the maximum capability of on-site healthcare units to allow for a more
timely discharge from the hospital back to the correctional facility. The utilization review staff
consists of doctors and nurses who are supported by medical directors at the regional and corporate
levels.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed a variety of customized databases to facilitate and improve
operational review including (i)&nbsp;a claims management tracking system that monitors current
outpatient charges and inpatient stays, (ii)&nbsp;a comprehensive cost review system that analyzes the
Company&#146;s average costs per inmate at each facility including pharmaceutical utilization and trend
analysis available from SPP and (iii)&nbsp;a daily operating report to manage staffing and off-site
utilization.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bid Process. </I>Contracts with governmental agencies are obtained primarily through a
competitive bidding process, which is governed by applicable state and local statutes and
ordinances. Although practices vary, typically a formal request for proposal (&#147;RFP&#148;) is issued by
the governmental agency, stating the scope of work to be performed, length of contract, performance
bonding requirements, minimum qualifications of bidders, selection criteria and the format to be
followed in the bid or proposal. Usually, a committee appointed by the governmental agency reviews
bids and makes an award determination. The committee may award the contract to a particular bidder
or decide not to award the contract. The committees consider a number of factors, including the
technical quality of the proposal, the bid price and the reputation of the bidder for providing
quality care. The award of a contract may be subject to formal or informal protest by unsuccessful
bidders through a governmental appeals process. If the committee does not award a contract, the
correctional agency will continue to provide healthcare services to its inmates with its own
personnel.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain RFPs and contracts require the bidder to post a bid bond or performance bond. These
bonding requirements may cover one year or up to the length of the contract and, at December&nbsp;31,
2004, generally ranged between 10% and 20% of the annual contract fee. Due to circumstances
related to September&nbsp;11, 2001 and the collapse of certain major corporations, the surety market has
sharply contracted and the cost of surety bonds has substantially increased. In order to avoid the
additional costs that performance bonds add to the contracts, increasingly clients are
reducing or eliminating the need for performance bonds.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts with governmental agencies often require it to comply with numerous
additional requirements regarding record-keeping and accounting, non-discrimination in the hiring
of personnel, safety, safeguarding confidential information, management qualifications,
professional licensing requirements, emergency healthcare needs of corrections employees and other
matters. If a violation of the terms of an applicable contractual or statutory provision occurs, a
contractor may be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for specified periods of
time in the applicable location. The Company has never been debarred or suspended in any
jurisdiction.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Marketing. </I>The Company gathers, monitors and analyzes relevant information on potential jail
and prison systems which meet predefined new business criteria. These criteria include facility
size, location, revenue and margin potential and exposure to risk. The Company then devotes the
necessary resources in securing new business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is the largest provider of healthcare services to county/municipal jails and
detention centers in the United States. The Company will continue to focus its business development
efforts on these facilities where stabilization and treatment of the population is the primary
mission. The Company will also continue to pursue certain opportunities at state prison systems,
where in many cases, services are provided to a larger system with a more permanent population. Due
to the more permanent population at the state prison facilities, the primary healthcare mission
shifts to disease management and treatment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a staff of sales and marketing representatives assigned to specific
projects, geographic areas or markets. In addition, the Company uses consultants to help identify
marketing opportunities, to determine the needs of specific potential customers and to engage
customers on the Company&#146;s behalf. The Company uses paid advertising and promotion to reach
prospective clients as well as to reinforce its image with existing clients.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that the constitutional requirement to provide healthcare to inmates, an
increasing inmate population and medical Consumer Price Index, combined with public sector budget
deficits, will continue the trend towards privatization of correctional healthcare and present
opportunities for future revenue growth for the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Pharmaceutical Distribution Services</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SPP, contracts with federal, state and local
governments and certain private entities to distribute pharmaceuticals and certain medical supplies
to inmates of correctional facilities. SPP&#146;s contracts typically cover one year with renewals upon
agreement of both parties. SPP utilizes a packaging and distribution center to fill prescriptions
and ship pharmaceuticals to over 300 sites in 36 states covering over 200,000 inmates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPP provides clinical pharmacy services in concert with their systematic delivery process.
SPP&#146;s clinical pharmacological management adds therapeutic value to services as well as fiscal
responsibility to its clients. In addition, SPP&#146;s medical supply service creates additional value
for its clients, as the packaging and delivery mode on certain products is advantageous to the
corrections environment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPP had fiscal year 2004 revenues of approximately $85.9&nbsp;million, $43.2&nbsp;million of which
relates to services provided for Company-contracted sites, which are eliminated in consolidation.
For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, revenues from correctional pharmacy services, excluding
revenues eliminated in consolidation, accounted for approximately 6.2% of the Company&#146;s healthcare
revenues from continuing operations and discontinued operations
combined. Required financial information related to this business
segment is set forth in Note 24 of the Company&#146;s consolidated
financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Risk Management</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contracts where the Company&#146;s exposure to the risk of inmates&#146; off-site expenses,
catastrophic illness or injury is not limited, the Company maintains stop loss insurance to cover
100% of the Company&#146;s exposure with respect to hospitalization for annual amounts in excess of
$500,000 per inmate up to an annual cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate and a lifetime cap of $2.0
million per inmate. The Company believes this insurance mitigates its exposure to individually
material expenses of catastrophic hospitalization. See &#147;Correctional Healthcare Services &#150;
Contract Provisions.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Employees and Independent Contractors</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services provided by the Company require an experienced staff of healthcare professionals
and facilities administrators. In particular, a nursing staff with experience in correctional
healthcare and specialized skills in all necessary areas contributes significantly to the Company&#146;s
ability to provide efficient service. In addition to nurses, the Company&#146;s staff of employees or
independent contractors includes physicians, dentists, psychologists and other healthcare
professionals.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had approximately 5,830 employees, including
approximately 630 doctors and 3,120 nurses. The Company also had under contract approximately 1,600
independent contractors, including physicians, dentists, psychiatrists and psychologists. Of the
Company&#146;s employees, approximately 300 are represented by labor unions. The Company believes that
its employee relations are good.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental entities is highly
competitive. The Company is in direct competition with local, regional and national correctional
healthcare providers including certain state medical schools and other

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">state or municipal
organizations. The Company estimates that it has approximately 9.9% of the
combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on estimates of national aggregate annual
expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its primary competitors are Correctional Medical
Services, which the Company estimates has approximately 7.9% of the combined privatized and
non-privatized market, and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., which the Company estimates has
approximately 3.1% of such market. As the private market for providing correctional healthcare
matures, the Company&#146;s competitors may gain additional experience in bidding and administering
correctional healthcare contracts. In addition, new competitors, some of whom may have extensive
experience in correctional healthcare, related fields or greater financial resources than the
Company, continue to enter the market.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Government Regulation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Governmental Regulations and Court Orders. </I>The industry in which the Company operates is
subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations and/or orders of judicial authorities,
including healthcare and safety regulations and judicial orders, decrees and judgments. Some of
the regulations and orders are unique to the Company&#146;s industry, and the combination of regulations
and orders it faces is unique. Generally, prospective providers of healthcare services to
correctional facilities must be able to detail their readiness to, and must comply with, a variety
of applicable state and local regulations and judicial orders. The Company&#146;s contracts typically
include reporting requirements, supervision and on-site monitoring by representatives of the
contracting governmental agencies or courts. In addition, the Company&#146;s doctors, nurses,
pharmacists and other healthcare professionals who provide services on its behalf are in most cases
required to obtain and maintain professional licenses and are subject to state regulation regarding
professional standards of conduct. The Company&#146;s services are also subject to operational and
financial audits by the governmental agencies with which the Company has contracts and by the
courts of competent jurisdiction. The Company may not always successfully comply with these
regulations and failure to comply can result in material penalties or non-renewal or termination of
contracts with correctional facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. </I>
The Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (&#147;HIPAA&#148;) require the use of uniform
electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment
transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended
to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HIPAA includes
regulations on standards to protect the security and privacy of health-related
information. The privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure
of individually identifiable health-related information, whether communicated
electronically, on paper or orally. The Company does not electronically file at
present, but may do so in the future, subjecting it to regulations of HIPAA.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting</I>. Many of the states in which the Company
operates have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations,
from employing physicians or laws that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments or
fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities. Possible
sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of a physician&#146;s license, civil and
criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements that may violate these restrictions.
These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and seldom have been interpreted by the
courts or regulatory agencies. The Company has recently undertaken a review of the applicable laws
in each state in which the Company operates and is in the process of reviewing its arrangements
with its healthcare providers to ensure that these arrangements comply with all applicable law. The
Company has no assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not
assert that the Company, or transactions in which it is involved, are in violation of such laws, or
that such laws ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with its
interpretations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Federal and State Laws Regarding the Distribution of Pharmaceuticals. </I>Institutional pharmacies
are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. These regulations cover required
qualifications, day-to-day operations, reimbursement and the documentation of activities. The
Company continuously monitors the effects of regulatory activity on its operations. In addition,
states generally require that companies operating a pharmacy within the state be licensed by the
state board of pharmacy. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had pharmacy licenses, or pending
applications, for each pharmacy in operation. In addition, the Company&#146;s pharmacies are registered
with the appropriate state and federal authorities pursuant to statutes governing the regulation of
controlled substances.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal and state laws impose certain repackaging, labeling and package insert requirements on
pharmacies that repackage drugs for distribution beyond the regular practice of dispensing or
selling drugs directly to patients at retail outlets. A drug repackager must register with the Food
and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) as a manufacturing establishment, and is subject to FDA inspection
for compliance with relevant good manufacturing practices (&#147;GMP&#148;). The Company holds all required
registrations and licenses, and believes its repackaging operations are in compliance with
applicable federal and state GMP requirements. In addition, the Company believes it complies with
all relevant requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act for the transfer and shipment of
pharmaceuticals.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Major Contracts</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s operating revenue with respect to its correctional healthcare operations is
derived primarily from contracts with state, county and local governmental entities. The Company&#146;s
Rikers Island, New York contract accounted for approximately 14.0% of the healthcare revenues from
continuing and discontinued operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 on a combined basis.
No other contract accounted for 10.0% or more of such revenues during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2004. Following are summaries of the Company&#146;s largest contracts based on healthcare revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Rikers Island Contract. </I>The Company, through its subsidiary, PHS, entered into a contract
with the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (&#147;HHC&#148;), effective January&nbsp;1, 2001, to
provide, among other things, medical healthcare services to inmates held by the Commissioner of the
New York City Department of Correction. The original term of the contract was three years, with
HHC having the option to extend the term for an additional year. During 2003, HHC exercised its
option to extend the contract for an additional year through December&nbsp;31, 2004. Also during 2003,
HHC assigned this contract to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (&#147;NYCDOH&#148;).
For the Company&#146;s services, NYCDOH paid the Company the cost of providing the services rendered
under the contract plus 4.25% of reimbursable costs. The Company was subject to mandatory staffing
requirements under the contract. NYCDOH is required to indemnify the Company and its employees and
independent contractors for damages for personal injuries and/or death alleged to have been
sustained by an inmate by reason of malpractice, except where the Company&#146;s employees or
independent contractors have engaged in intentional misconduct or a criminal act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2005, the Company, through its subsidiary PHS, entered into a new
contract with NYCDOH to provide comprehensive medical, mental health, dental and ancillary services
to inmates in the custody of the New York City Department of Correction. The new three-year &#147;cost
plus fixed fee&#148; contract commenced on January&nbsp;1, 2005 and may be extended by the client for up to
an additional three years. Annual revenues under the contract are expected to be approximately
$100&nbsp;million in 2005. The Company is subject to mandatory staffing requirements under the
contract. NYCDOH is required to indemnify the Company and its employees and independent
contractors for damages for personal injuries and/or death alleged to have been sustained by an
inmate by reason of malpractice, except where the Company&#146;s employees or independent contractors
have engaged in intentional misconduct or a criminal act. Either party may terminate the contract
without cause at any time on 12&nbsp;months&#146; notice. Either party may terminate on ten days&#146; notice for
a material breach of the contract subject to certain cure provisions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. </I>The Company, through PHS,
entered into a contract with the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services
(&#147;Maryland DPS&#148;) on July&nbsp;1, 2000, to provide comprehensive medical services to four regions of the
Maryland prison system. The initial term of the contract was for three years ending June&nbsp;30, 2003,
with the Maryland DPS having the ability to renew the contract for two additional one year terms.
The contract is presently in its second renewal term and is non-cancelable by the Company. The
Maryland DPS pays the Company a flat fee per month with certain limited cost sharing adjustments
for staffing costs, primarily nurses, and the cost of medications related to certain specific
illnesses. The Company is fully at risk for increases in hospitalization and outpatient costs
under the terms of the contract with the Maryland DPS. The contract also contains provisions that
allow the Maryland DPS to assess penalties if certain staffing or performance criteria are not
maintained. The flat fee paid to the Company is increased annually based on a portion of the
consumer price index.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss contract charge totaling $12.8&nbsp;million to
cover estimated future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland DPS contract
until its expiration in June&nbsp;2005. For more information refer to the loss contract section within
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates&#148; contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The current
contract ends on June&nbsp;30, 2005 and is currently out for competitive rebid.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. </I>The Company, through PHS, entered
into a contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (&#147;Pennsylvania
DOC&#148;) on September&nbsp;1, 2003, for a period of five years for medical services exclusive of mental
health and pharmacy. The contract covers each of the 27 Pennsylvania prison system facilities.
The Pennsylvania DOC pays the Company a flat rate per month, which is adjusted for changes in
inmate population levels. Under the terms of the contract, the Company is reimbursed for the costs
of the medical malpractice insurance related to this contract and its exposure to off-site medical
costs related to this contract is limited to a specified maximum amount. Pharmacy and mental
health services are provided by separate contractors to the Pennsylvania DOC. The contract also
contains provisions that allow the Pennsylvania DOC to assess penalties if certain staffing
criteria are not maintained. The Pennsylvania DOC may terminate the contract on six months notice.
After the first eighteen months, the Company may terminate the contract without cause subject to a
nine-month notice to the Pennsylvania DOC.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Alabama Department of Corrections. </I>The Company, through PHS, entered into a contract with the
Alabama Department of Corrections (&#147;Alabama DOC&#148;) on November&nbsp;3, 2003, for a period of three years
which may be extended for two additional one year terms, to provide comprehensive medical services
to the state of Alabama&#146;s prison system. The contract covers each of the 13 Alabama prison system
facilities and the work release programs associated with each facility. The Alabama DOC pays the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any or all of the Company&#146;s forward-looking statements in this annual report may turn out to
be inaccurate. The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current
expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that it believes may affect
its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. They can be
affected by inaccurate assumptions the Company might make or by known or unknown risks,
uncertainties and assumptions, including the risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in
&#147;Risk Factors.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and
circumstances discussed in this annual report may not occur and actual results could differ
materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking
statements. When considering
these forward-looking statements, keep in mind these risk factors and other cautionary
statements in this annual report, included in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations&#148; and &#147;Business.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. The Company
undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral
forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this annual report.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any of the events discussed in the following risks were
to occur, the Company&#146;s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial by the Company, may also constrain its business and operations.
In either case, the trading price of the Company&#146;s common stock could

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">





<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Client Contracts. </I>The Company&#146;s operating revenue is derived almost exclusively from
contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies. Generally, contracts may be
terminated by the governmental agency at will and without cause upon proper notice (typically
between 90 and 120&nbsp;days). Governmental agencies may be subject to political influences that could
lead to termination of a contract through no fault of the Company. Although the Company generally
attempts to renew or renegotiate contracts at or prior to their termination, contracts that are put
out for bid are subject to intense competition. As a result, the Company&#146;s portfolio of contracts
is subject to change. The changes in the Company&#146;s portfolio of contracts are largely
unpredictable, which creates uncertainties about the amount of its total revenues from period to
period. The Company must engage in competitive bidding for new business to replace contracts that
expire or are terminated. The Company, therefore, has no assurance that it will be able to replace
contracts that expire or are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or otherwise. The
non-renewal or termination of any of the Company&#146;s contracts with governmental agencies could
materially affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Government Funding. </I>The Company&#146;s cash flow is subject to the receipt of
sufficient funding of, and timely payment by, the government entities with which it contracts.
Economic circumstances at the national, state or local level could affect government entity
budgets, which could result in insufficient funding, increased pricing pressure or termination of
contracts. If a government entity does not receive sufficient funding to cover its obligations
under a healthcare services contract, the contract may be terminated, payment for the Company&#146;s
services could be delayed or not occur. The termination of contracts, a significant delay in
payment or non-payment could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Privatization of Government Services and Correctional Population. </I>The Company&#146;s future
revenue growth will depend in part on continued privatization by state, county and local
governmental agencies of healthcare services for correctional facilities. The Company believes
that more than $30&nbsp;million in annualized correctional healthcare contract revenues were newly
privatized in 2004 by governmental agencies either for the first time or as a result of the
expansion of existing contracted services to encompass additional or expanded services. There can
be no assurance that this market will continue to grow at historical rates or at all, or that
existing contracts will continue to be made available to the private sector. Revenue growth could
also be adversely affected by material decreases in the inmate population of correctional
facilities. Any of these results could cause the Company&#146;s revenue to decline and harm its
business and operating results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Negative
Publicity.</I> Negative publicity regarding the provision of correctional healthcare services by for-profit
companies, including the Company, could adversely affect the
Company&#146;s results of operations or business. Privatization of healthcare services for correctional facilities may encounter resistance from
groups or constituencies that believe that healthcare services to correctional facilities should
only be provided by governmental agencies. Negative publicity regarding the privatization of
correctional healthcare services may result in increased regulation and legislative review of
industry practices that further increase the Company&#146;s costs of doing business and adversely affect
its results of operations by:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, negative publicity relating to the Company in particular also may adversely affect
its ability to renew or maintain existing contracts or to obtain new contracts, which could have a
material adverse effect on its business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Compliance
with Government Regulation.</I> Failure to comply with governmental regulation and/or orders of judicial authorities could
result in material penalties or non-renewal or termination of the
Company&#146;s contracts to manage correctional
and detention facilities. The industry in which the Company operates is subject to extensive
federal, state and local regulations, including educational, health care and safety regulations and
judicial orders, decrees and judgments. Some of the regulations are
unique to the Company&#146;s industry, and
the combination of regulations it faces is unique. Generally, providers of healthcare services to
correctional facilities must be able to detail their readiness to, and must comply with, a variety
of applicable state and local regulations and court orders. The Company&#146;s contracts typically
include reporting requirements, supervision and on-site monitoring by representatives of the
contracting governmental agencies or courts. The Company may not always successfully comply with
these regulations or court orders, and failure to comply can result in material penalties,
sanctions or non-renewal or termination of contracts, which could have a materially adverse affect
on its business and results of operation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Governmental
Agency Investigations and Audits.</I> Government agencies may investigate and audit the Company&#146;s contracts and it may be required
to refund revenues the Company has received, to forego anticipated revenues, including prohibitions on its

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">bidding in response to RFPs. Certain of the governmental agencies the Company contracts with have
the authority to audit and investigate its contracts with them. As part of that process,
government agencies may review the Company&#146;s performance under the contract, its pricing practices,
its cost structure and its compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. For
contracts that actually or effectively provide for certain reimbursement of expenses, if an agency
determines that the Company has incorrectly allocated costs to a specific contract, the Company may
not be reimbursed for those costs, and it could be required to refund the amount of any such costs
that have been reimbursed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Competition. </I>The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental
agencies is highly competitive. The Company is in direct competition with local, regional and
national correctional healthcare providers including certain state medical schools and other state
or municipal organizations. The Company estimates that it has
approximately 9.9% of the combined
privatized and non-privatized market, based on national aggregate annual expenditures on
correctional healthcare services. Its primary competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which
the Company estimates has approximately 7.9% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market,
and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., which the Company estimates has approximately 3.1% of such
market. As the private market for providing correctional healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s
competitors may gain additional experience in bidding and administering correctional healthcare
contracts. Competitors may use the additional experience to underbid the Company. In addition, new
competitors, some of whom may have extensive experience in related fields or greater financial
resources than the Company, may enter the market. Increased competition could result in a loss of
contracts and market share and could seriously harm the Company&#146;s business and operating results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Acquisitions. </I>The Company&#146;s expansion strategy involves both internal growth and, as
opportunities become available, acquisitions. The inability to successfully integrate future
acquisitions would seriously harm the Company&#146;s business or operating revenues.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Exposure to Catastrophic Events. </I>Contracts accounting for approximately 28% of the Company&#146;s
correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December
31, 2004 contain no limits on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to catastrophic
illnesses or injuries to inmates. Although the Company attempts to compensate for the increased
financial risk when pricing contracts that do not contain catastrophic limits and has not had any
catastrophic illnesses or injuries to inmates that exceeded its insurance coverage in the past,
there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience a catastrophic illness or injury of
a patient that exceeds its coverage in the future. The occurrence of severe individual cases
outside of those catastrophic limits could render contracts unprofitable and could have a material
adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Key Personnel. </I>The success of the Company depends in large part on the ability
and experience of its senior management. The loss of services of one or more key employees could
adversely affect the Company&#146;s business and operating results. The Company has employment contracts
with Michael Catalano, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lawrence H. Pomeroy, Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer;
Michael W. Taylor, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Trey Hartman, Executive
Vice President and President of PHS, as well as certain other key personnel. The Company does not
maintain key man life insurance on any member of its senior management.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Healthcare Personnel. </I>The Company&#146;s success depends on its ability to attract
and retain highly skilled healthcare personnel. A shortage of trained and competent employees
and/or independent contractors may result in overtime costs or the need to hire less efficient and
more costly temporary staff. Attracting qualified nurses at a reasonable cost in some markets has
been and continues to be of concern to the Company. Approximately 39% of the Company&#146;s contracts
contain financial penalties that apply when performance or staffing criteria are not achieved. For
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company incurred revenue deductions related to these criteria
totaling approximately $2.5&nbsp;million, or 0.4% of the Company&#146;s healthcare revenues from continuing
operations and discontinued operations combined.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company faces competition for staffing, which may increase its labor costs and reduce
profitability. The Company competes with other healthcare and service providers in recruiting
qualified management and staff personnel for the day-to-day operations of its business, including
nurses and other healthcare professionals. In some markets, the scarcity of nurses and other
medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to healthcare businesses. This
scarcity may require the Company to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified
nurses and other healthcare professionals. Because a significant percentage of the Company&#146;s
existing contracts are structured as fixed fee contracts, the Company has a limited ability to pass
along increased labor costs to existing customers. If the Company is not successful in attracting
and retaining a sufficient number of qualified healthcare personnel in the future, it may not be
able to perform under its contracts, which could lead to the loss of existing contracts or its
ability to gain new contracts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Corporate Exposure to Professional Liability. </I>The Company periodically becomes involved in
medical malpractice claims with the attendant risk of substantial damage awards. The most
significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits brought by inmates
alleging lack of timely or adequate healthcare services. The Company may be vicariously liable for
the negligence

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">of healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The Company&#146;s contracts generally provide
for the Company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare
provided by the Company and its agents. The Company maintains professional and general liability
insurance; however, due to the use of a large deductible policy in 2001 and the use of adjustable
premium policies in 2002, 2003 and 2004 the Company is self-insured for professional liability
claims incurred under its primary program. In addition to its primary program, the Company also
has insurance policies that relate to certain specific healthcare services contracts. Management
establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will be incurred under these insurance policies
using internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis of claim
history and the estimated reserves assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator. The Company
requires its independent contractors to maintain professional liability insurance in amounts deemed
appropriate by management based upon the Company&#146;s claims history and the nature and risks of its
business. However, there can be no assurance that a future claim or claims will not exceed
management&#146;s loss estimates or the limits of available insurance coverage.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the cost of malpractice and other liability insurance has risen significantly.
Adequate levels of insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable price. The Company
is dependent on the financial health of the insurance carriers with whom it has insurance policies.
Failure to obtain sufficient levels of professional liability insurance or deterioration in an
insurance carrier&#146;s financial health may expose the Company to significant losses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Information Systems. </I>The Company depends on its information technology systems
for timely and accurate information. Failure to maintain effective and efficient information
technology systems or disruptions in the Company&#146;s information technology systems could cause
disruptions in its business operations, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new
customers, disputes with customers and providers, potential regulatory problems, increases in
administrative expenses and other adverse consequences.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Credit Facility. </I>The Company&#146;s debt consists of a credit facility dated October
31, 2002 with CapitalSource Finance LLC. The Company is dependent on the availability of
borrowings pursuant to this credit facility to meet its working capital needs, capital expenditure
requirements and other cash flow requirements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credit facility requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants related to
minimum levels of earnings. The financial covenants contained in the credit facility are described
in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150;
Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should the Company
fail to meet its projected results or fail to remain in compliance with the terms of the credit
facility, it may be forced to seek alternative sources of financing. No assurances can be made
that the Company can obtain alternative financing arrangements on terms acceptable to it, or at
all.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s credit facility with CapitalSource Finance LLC expires on October&nbsp;31, 2005. As
a result, the Company will be required to replace this credit facility during 2005. No assurances
can be made that the Company can obtain replacement financing arrangements on terms acceptable to
it, or at all.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Performance Bonds. </I>The Company is required under certain contracts to provide a performance
bond. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company has outstanding performance bonds totaling $22.5&nbsp;million.
The performance bonds are renewed on an annual basis. The market for performance bonds was
severely impacted by certain recent corporate failures and the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001 and
continues to be impacted by general economic conditions. Consequently, the sureties for the
Company&#146;s performance bond program may require additional collateral to issue or renew performance
bonds in support of certain contracts. The letters of credit, currently in the amount of $4.0
million, which the Company utilizes as collateral for its performance bonds reduce availability
under the Company&#146;s credit facility and limit funds available for debt service and working capital.
The Company is also dependant on the financial health of the surety companies that it relies on to
issue its performance bonds. An inability to obtain new or renew existing performance bonds could
result in limitations on the Company&#146;s ability to bid for new or renew existing contracts which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of
operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Other Available Information</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company files its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). Copies of these documents may be

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>EMSA lease matter. </I>On July&nbsp;12, 2004, EMSA Limited Partnership, a limited partnership owned by
the Company, received an unexpected adverse jury verdict in the Circuit Court, 11<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP>
Judicial Circuit, Miami-Dade County, Florida of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million plus potential interest
which has the potential to double the amount of the award to $2.5&nbsp;million. This verdict relates to
a 12&nbsp;year old case filed by the plaintiff, Community Health Related Services, Inc. (wholly owned by
Dr.&nbsp;Carlos Vicaria) seeking unspecified damages involving a lease dispute in connection with a line
of business managing physician clinics operated by EMSA Limited Partnership prior to its
acquisition by the Company in 1999. The Company did not acquire this line of business or assume
the expired sublease from the seller under the transaction. The Company has, to date, been forced
to defend the case as the seller has not yet assumed responsibility. The trial judge has yet to
enter the jury&#146;s verdict as a final judgment and the Company has filed a motion for new trial, a
motion for remittitur or new trial as to damages, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict, and for judgment in accordance with its previous motion for a directed verdict. The
matter currently remains under advisement with the court and the Company will continue to
vigorously defend the lawsuit and believes that it will ultimately be successful, through either
its post-trial motions or on appeal, in having the verdict award reduced or overturned. However,
in the event the Company is not successful at the trial court level or on appeal, or if the Company
decides not to appeal an unfavorable verdict, an adverse judgment could have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company, after giving consideration to its post-trial motions and appeal
rights, estimates that its probable loss related to this matter will be significantly below the
$1.2&nbsp;million jury verdict amount. The Company&#146;s reserves related to this matter are included in
its reserves for all general legal matters, which total approximately $900,000 as of December&nbsp;31,
2004. In addition to its rights under post-verdict motions and the potential for appeal, the
Company has filed suit against Caremark RX, Inc. (&#147;Caremark&#148;), the successor to the party who sold
EMSA to the Company, for indemnification for all costs associated with this case as well as any
judgment returned which is adverse to the Company. Caremark is defending this lawsuit and the
Company does not know whether it will prevail against Caremark. Accordingly, such reimbursement
has not been reflected in the Company&#146;s reserve estimate discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Polk County matter. </I>During 2003, the Company was successful on its appeal of a previous
summary judgment granted against it in January&nbsp;2002 on an indemnification claim by the insurer of a
client. The case has now been remanded to the lower court in accordance with the appellate court&#146;s
opinion as discussed below. In December&nbsp;1995, the Florida Association of Counties Trust (&#147;FACT&#148;),
as the insurer for the Polk County Sheriff&#146;s Office, and the Sheriff of Polk County, Florida, (the
&#147;Sheriff&#146;s Office&#148;) brought an action against the
Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, PHS, in the Circuit Court, 10th Judicial Circuit, Polk County, Florida seeking
indemnification for $1.0&nbsp;million allegedly paid on behalf of FACT for settlement of a lawsuit
brought against the Sheriff&#146;s Office. The recovery is sought for amounts paid in settlement of a
wrongful death claim brought by the estate of an inmate who died as a result of injuries sustained
from a beating from several corrections officers employed by the Sheriff&#146;s Office. In addition,
the Sheriff&#146;s Office released the Company from any liability for this claim subsequent to filing
the FACT lawsuit. The plaintiffs contend that an indemnification provision in the contract between
PHS and the Sheriff&#146;s Office obligates the Company to indemnify the Sheriff&#146;s Office against losses
caused by its own wrongful acts. The Company was represented by counsel provided by Reliance
Insurance Company (&#147;Reliance&#148;), the Company&#146;s insurer. In April&nbsp;2001, FACT&#146;s motion for summary
judgment on the question of liability for indemnity was denied, but on rehearing in July&nbsp;2001 the
prior denial was reversed and summary judgment was granted. In October&nbsp;2001, Reliance filed for
receivership. In January&nbsp;2002, the court entered final judgment in favor of FACT for approximately
$1.7&nbsp;million at a hearing at which the Company was not represented, as counsel provided by Reliance
had simultaneously filed a motion to withdraw. The Company retained new counsel in February&nbsp;2002
and obtained a reversal of the summary judgment motion on October&nbsp;31, 2003. The case has been
remanded to the trial court to determine if the actions of the officers, for which some of them
were indicted and convicted, were indemnifiable as a matter of public policy and whether the claims
for which indemnity was sought arose out of the provision of medical services and not the actions
of the officers. The parties agreed to submit the matter to nonbinding arbitration and the Company
received a successful ruling in July&nbsp;2004. FACT has not moved to engage in discovery necessary for
any trial. Should the matter go forward to trial the Company believes it will ultimately be
successful at the trial court level. However, in the event the Company is not successful at the
trial court level, an adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the
Company has no reserves associated with this proceeding.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;24, 2004, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized and approved a
three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50&nbsp;percent dividend on the Company&#146;s common
stock. Such additional shares of common stock were issued on October&nbsp;29, 2004 to all shareholders
of record as of the close of business on October&nbsp;8, 2004. Fractional shares were eliminated in
the form of a cash dividend which was approved by lenders on the Company&#146;s credit facility. All
price per share amounts above have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock
split.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the dividend for fractional shares discussed above, the Company did not pay cash
dividends on its common stock during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003. The Company has
not paid any cash dividends and expects for the foreseeable future to retain all of its earnings to
finance the development of its business. In addition, under the terms of its credit facility, the
Company is prohibited from paying cash dividends on its common stock.

&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations&#148;
and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describing the reclassification from continuing
operations to discontinued operations of contracts terminating during 2004, 2003 and 2002. During
2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded adjustments to the loss contract reserve. During
2000, the Company acquired certain assets of SPP and CPS and purchased all of the outstanding
common stock of CHS in three separate purchase transactions. These acquisitions were accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of the acquired entities have
been included in the Company&#146;s consolidated operating results since the respective acquisition
dates. During 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $5.2&nbsp;million for final settlement of
a Florida legal matter and an income tax benefit of $5.3&nbsp;million related to the reversal of
substantially all of a previously recorded valuation allowance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;24, 2004, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized and approved a
three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50&nbsp;percent dividend on the Company&#146;s common
stock. Such additional shares of common stock were issued on October&nbsp;29, 2004 to all shareholders
of record as of the close of business on October&nbsp;8, 2004. All share and per share amounts
presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.

$41.1&nbsp;million, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the Company&#146;s revolving credit
facility. This revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October&nbsp;31, 2005; however, due to
the presence of a typical material adverse effect clause in the loan agreement combined with the
existence of a mandatory lock-box agreement, borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit
facility have been classified as a current liability in prior years in accordance with the guidance
in the Financial Accounting Standard Board&#146;s Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus 95-22, &#147;Balance
Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding Under Revolving Credit Agreements that Include Both
a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by its more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts
with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing arrangements, such as stop-loss
provisions and aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical costs. Such contracts typically
have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and generally may be terminated
by either party at will and without cause upon proper notice. Revenues earned under contracts with
correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered. Cash received in
advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the
service is performed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a margin. For fixed fee contracts,
revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service contract. Revenues
for population based contracts are calculated either as a fixed fee adjusted using a per diem rate
for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate
times the average inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus contracts, revenues
are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual
margin.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a portion of the
Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in the majority
of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools for off-site expenses, stop loss provisions,
cost plus fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of off-site service costs.
Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically
under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue under the contract increases to offset
increases in specified cost categories such as off-site expenses or pharmaceutical costs. For
contracts which include such provisions, the Company recognizes the additional revenues that would
be due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract to date costs incurred as
compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs. Because such provisions
typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and require all such additional
revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the additional revenues are initially
recorded as

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">unbilled receivables until the time period for billing has been met and actual costs are
known. Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates of incurred costs and the actual costs are
recorded in the period in which such differences become known along with the corresponding
adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related criteria. If necessary,
the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods when the actual amount of
the adjustment is determined.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon
delivery of the related products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and other healthcare
professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing the managed
care including the costs of professional and general liability insurance and other self-funded
insurance reserves discussed more fully below. The cost of healthcare services provided or
contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided based in part on estimates,
including an accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet
date. The Company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization
data including hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and emergency room and
ambulance visits and their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the average historical
cost of such services. An actuarial analysis is also prepared periodically by an independent
actuary to evaluate the adequacy of the Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have
sufficient claims payment history. The analysis takes into account historical claims experience
(including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial
data. Additionally, the Company&#146;s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of
inpatient hospital stays in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the
historical average rates. Once identified, reserves for such stays are determined which take into
consideration the specific facts of the stay.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the
healthcare cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of
claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual
claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are
made. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a decrease of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million and
increases of approximately $0.9&nbsp;million and $0.6&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims
liabilities as a result of differences between actual and estimated claims experience.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts</I>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts
receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. The Company
recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts to ensure receivables are
not overstated due to uncollectibility. Bad debt reserves are
established based on a variety of factors, including the length of
time receivables are past due, significant one-time events,
discussions with clients and historical experience. If circumstances
change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be
further adjusted.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Loss Contracts</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has
been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company performs this
loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as future
contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs, projected future stop-loss
insurance recoveries and each contract&#146;s specific terms related to future revenue increases as
compared to increased healthcare costs. The projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are
estimated based on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost increases. These
estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims experience as previously
noted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a contract loss reserve for succeeding
periods. As a result of its fourth quarter 2001 review, the Company identified five non-cancelable
contracts that, based upon management&#146;s projections, were expected to continue to incur negative
gross margins over their remaining terms. In December&nbsp;2001, the Company recorded a charge of $18.3
million to establish a reserve for future losses under these non-cancelable contracts. The five
contracts covered by the charge had expiration dates ranging from June&nbsp;30, 2002 through June&nbsp;30,
2005. Ninety percent of the charge related to the State of Kansas Department of Corrections (the
&#147;Kansas DOC&#148;) contract, which was to expire on June&nbsp;30, 2005, and the City of Philadelphia
contract, which was renewable annually, at the client&#146;s option, through June&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2002, the Company and the City of Philadelphia reached a mutual agreement that the
contract between PHS and the City of Philadelphia would expire effective June&nbsp;30, 2002. As a
result of the earlier than anticipated expiration of this loss contract, the Company recorded a
gain of $3.3&nbsp;million, in the second quarter of 2002, to reduce its reserve for loss contracts.
From July&nbsp;1, 2002 to September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company provided services to the City of Philadelphia
under a transition arrangement. Subsequent to September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company is continuing to
provide healthcare services to the City of Philadelphia under modified contract terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, the Company utilized its loss contract reserve at a
rate greater than previously anticipated due to an unexpected increase in healthcare expenses
associated with the Company&#146;s contract to provide services to the Kansas DOC. The primary causes
for the increase in healthcare expenses in this contract were hospitalization and outpatient costs.
The Company increased its reserve for loss contracts by $4.5&nbsp;million, as of June&nbsp;30, 2003, to
cover estimated future losses under the Kansas DOC

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">contract, which was to expire in June&nbsp;2005. This increase in the reserve for loss contracts
is reflected as a component of income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s
consolidated statements of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second and third quarters of 2003, the Company participated in active discussions
with the Kansas DOC related to a proposal from the Company that would significantly reduce the
remaining length of the current contract. In response to the proposal, the Kansas DOC solicited
and received proposals from several other vendors to provide healthcare services to the Kansas DOC.
After the Kansas DOC&#146;s evaluation of the proposals from the other vendors, in August&nbsp;2003, the
Company began discussions with Health Cost Solutions, Inc. (&#147;HCS&#148;) and the Kansas DOC related to a
proposal pursuant to which HCS would assume the Company&#146;s performance obligation under the Kansas
DOC contract.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company entered into an assignment and novation agreement with the
Kansas DOC to assign the Kansas DOC contract to HCS effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. The Company also
entered into a general assignment, novation and assumption agreement with HCS to transfer the
Kansas DOC contract to HCS, effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. Beginning October&nbsp;1, 2003, HCS became
solely responsible for the performance of the Kansas DOC contract, and the Company has no
obligation to the Kansas DOC or to HCS related to HCS&#146; performance of the contract, therefore the
operating results of this contract have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all
periods presented. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s agreement with HCS, the Company agreed to pay
HCS net consideration of $5.6&nbsp;million in 21&nbsp;monthly installments, which commenced October&nbsp;31, 2003
and will continue through June&nbsp;30, 2005. As a result of the financial terms of the Company&#146;s
agreement with HCS, in the third quarter of 2003, the Company reclassified $6.5&nbsp;million of its
reserve for loss contracts to accounts payable and recorded a gain of $1.7&nbsp;million, to reduce its
reserve for loss contracts. This decrease in the reserve for loss contracts is reflected as a
component of income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated
statements of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contract with the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services
(&#147;Maryland DPS&#148;) has historically underperformed, fluctuating between minimal profitability,
breakeven and losses. This contract was entered into on July&nbsp;1, 2000, to provide comprehensive
medical services to four regions of the Maryland prison system. The initial term of the contract
was for the three years ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, with the Maryland DPS having the ability to renew the
contract for two additional one-year terms. The contract is presently in its second renewal term
and is non-cancelable by the Company. The Maryland DPS pays the Company a flat fee per month with
certain limited cost-sharing adjustments for staffing costs, primarily nurses, and the cost of
medications related to certain specific illnesses. The Company is fully at risk for increases in
hospitalization and outpatient costs under the terms of the contract with the Maryland DPS. The
contract also contains provisions that allow the Maryland DPS to assess penalties if certain
staffing or performance criteria are not maintained. The flat fee paid to the Company is increased
annually based on a portion of the consumer price index.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the flat fee nature of this contract, the Company&#146;s margin under the contract can be
significantly impacted by changes in healthcare costs, utilization trends or inmate population.
The Company incurred losses under this contract in April&nbsp;2004 at a level slightly above
expectations. The losses under the contract increased significantly in May&nbsp;2004 to approximately
$1.1&nbsp;million for the month. The primary cause for the increased loss was an unanticipated increase
in hospitalization costs beginning in May, resulting from the volume and acuity of services being
provided, the number of HIV and mental health patients and the costs associated with current
treatment guidelines. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss
contract charge of $6.8&nbsp;million, effective June&nbsp;1, 2004, which represented its &#147;most likely&#148;
estimate, at that date, of the future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland
DPS contract through its expiration on June&nbsp;30, 2005. This estimate assumed monthly losses under
the contract would diminish from the May&nbsp;2004 level, which was viewed as an aberration, to
approximately $0.5&nbsp;million per month, including allocated overhead, an amount significantly above
recent historical levels.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2004, the Company utilized $2.6&nbsp;million of its loss contract
reserve, almost entirely due to the underperformance of the Maryland DPS contract. While actual
monthly losses incurred under the Maryland DPS contract had trended downward from the record loss
in May, losses once again increased in September, driven primarily by off-site medical costs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off-site medical costs under the Maryland DPS contract averaged $1.3&nbsp;million per month for
June through September&nbsp;2004, as compared with initial estimates of $1.0&nbsp;million per month, based on
historical results. As a result of this new and more severe trend, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $6.0&nbsp;million, effective September&nbsp;30, 2004, to increase its reserve for estimated future
losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland DPS contract until its expiration in
June&nbsp;2005. A fundamental assumption of the $6.0&nbsp;million increase in loss reserve was that the
contract would continue to incur on average $1.4&nbsp;million per month of off-site medical costs
through its termination on June&nbsp;30, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter, the Company utilized $3.4&nbsp;million of its loss contract reserve,
which relates to the Maryland DPS and a county contract. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had
a loss contract reserve totaling $6.1&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Company believes it is adequately reserved at present, there can be no assurance
that in the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might revise its
estimate of future losses related to the contracts currently identified as loss


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">18

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">contacts. It might also identify additional contracts which have become loss contracts due to
a change in circumstances. Circumstances that might change and result in a revised estimate of
future losses or the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period include
unanticipated adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the
utilization of outside medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by
increased healthcare revenues. Should the Company identify circumstances that would result in a
revision of its estimate of future losses for a loss contract, the Company would, in the period in
which the revision is made, increase or decrease the reserve for loss contracts. Should a contract
be identified as a loss contract in a future period, the Company would record, in the period in
which such identification is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that would be incurred
under the contract. A revision to a current loss contract or the identification of a loss contract
in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the
period in which the reserve is recorded.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-Insurance Retention</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company is subject to medical malpractice claims and lawsuits.
The most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits brought by
inmates alleging lack of timely or adequate healthcare services. The Company may also be liable,
as employer, for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or the healthcare
professionals it engages as independent contractors. The Company&#146;s contracts generally require it
to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the
Company or its agents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains its primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. However, due to the use of large
deductibles in 2001 and the use of adjustable premium policies in 2002, 2003 and 2004 the Company
is self-insured for professional liability claims incurred under its primary program. For 2002,
2003 and 2004, the Company is covered by separate policies, each of which contains a 42-month
retro-premium with adjustment based on actual losses after 42&nbsp;months. The Company&#146;s ultimate
premium for its 2002, 2003 and 2004 policies will depend on the final incurred losses related to
each of these separate policy periods. Reserves for estimated losses related to known claims are
provided for on an undiscounted basis using internal and external evaluations of the merits of the
individual claims, analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves assigned by the Company&#146;s
third-party administrator. Any adjustments resulting from the review are reflected in current
earnings. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded increases of approximately $4.7&nbsp;million,
$0.7&nbsp;million and $0.3&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims reserves as a result of
adverse development. The 2004 increase primarily relates to adverse development in eight claims.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but
not reported claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an
undiscounted basis. The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by an independent
actuarial analysis, which is obtained on a periodic basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company&#146;s reserves for known and incurred but not reported claims
totaled $18.7&nbsp;million. Reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number of
claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next.
Furthermore, payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the
estimated liability. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and
differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to
the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which the estimates are changed or
payments are made. The reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the
third-party insurance carriers used by the Company. If a third party insurance carrier fails to
meet its contractual obligations under the agreement with the Company, the Company would then be
responsible for such obligations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Other Self-Funded Insurance Reserves</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company has approximately $8.8&nbsp;million in accrued liabilities for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. The Company is essentially self-insured for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain individual stop loss
provisions. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and the
ability to control claims. The Company accrues the estimated liability for employee health
insurance based on its history of claims experience and the estimated time lag between the incident
date and the date of actual claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated liability for
workers&#146; compensation claims based on internal and external evaluations of the merits of the
individual claims, analysis of claims history and the estimated reserves assigned by the Company&#146;s
third-party administrator. On a periodic basis, the Company obtains an independent actuarial
analysis to further support the appropriateness of the workers&#146; compensation reserves. These estimates of self-funded insurance reserves could change in
the future based on changes in the factors discussed above. Any adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are reflected in current
earnings. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded an increase of approximately $0.2 million and decreases of approximately $0.8 million
and $0.3 million, respectively, to its prior year other self-insurance reserves as a result of differences between actual and estimated claims experience.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Legal Contingencies</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to professional and general liability claims, the Company is also subject to other
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such proceedings generally relate to labor,
employment or contract matters. When estimable, the Company accrues an estimate of the probable
costs for the resolution of these claims. Such estimates are developed in consultation with outside
counsel

any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions,
new developments or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with
such litigation. See discussion of certain outstanding legal matters in Part&nbsp;I &#150; Item&nbsp;3 &#147;Legal

Intangible Assets, </I>(&#147;SFAS 142&#148;), goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment
on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. The Company performed its annual review as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.
Based on the results of this annual review, management has determined that goodwill is not impaired
as of December&nbsp;31, 2004. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and that goodwill is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a
material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer contracts acquired in
acquisitions and covenants not to compete, are amortized on the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives. The Company also assesses the impairment of its other identifiable
intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired based upon the
existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment or as a result of its annual
impairment review, any impairment is measured using a fair-value-based goodwill impairment test as
required under the provisions of SFAS 142. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be
bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number
of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value
techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value
of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation
techniques.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company determines that the carrying value of other intangible assets may not be
recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, any
impairment is measured using an estimate of the asset&#146;s fair value based on the projected net cash
flows expected to result from that asset, including eventual disposition.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles on at
least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and circumstances, including its retention
rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and circumstances indicate the current estimated life
is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the estimated useful life on a prospective basis. In
the third quarter of 2002, the Company revised the estimated life of the contract intangibles,
acquired in its 1999 acquisition of EMSA, from 20&nbsp;years to 10&nbsp;years. The revised life impacted
contract intangibles with a gross value of $11.2&nbsp;million and, beginning October&nbsp;1, 2002, resulted
in an increase to annual amortization expense of $0.9&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes. </I>Under the asset and liability method of SFAS No.
109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; It further states &#147;forming a conclusion that a
valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative
losses in recent years.&#148; Since December&nbsp;31, 2001 and until June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company maintained a
100% valuation allowance equal to its net deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets
that could be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the Company&#146;s results of operations since December&nbsp;31, 2001, and its expected
profitability in this and future years, the Company concluded, effective June&nbsp;30, 2004, that it is
more likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets will be realized. As a
result, in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to
such net deferred tax assets was reversed in the second quarter of 2004. Reversal of the valuation
allowance resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2004 totaling $5.3
million. This benefit represented the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax assets,
excluding those deferred tax assets that resulted from the exercise of employee stock options. The
reversal of the valuation allowance that related to the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax
assets resulting from the exercises of employee stock options totaled $3.9&nbsp;million and was recorded
as a direct increase to additional paid-in capital in the stockholders&#146; equity portion of the
Company&#146;s balance sheet as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company&#146;s valuation
allowance of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million represents management&#146;s estimate of state net operating
loss carryforwards which will expire unused.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that
the Company&#146;s tax return positions are fully supported, the Company believes that certain positions
will be challenged and a risk exists that the Company&#146;s positions will not be fully sustained. The
tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of tax audits, case law, and emerging legislation. The Company&#146;s tax contingency accruals
are reflected as a component of accrued liabilities.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 5 of the Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is
applying the discontinued operations provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;), to all correctional healthcare service contracts that expire subsequent to
January&nbsp;1, 2002. SFAS No.&nbsp;144 requires the Company to follow the income statement presentation
format described in SFAS No.&nbsp;144. The results of operations of contracts that expire, less
applicable income taxes, are classified on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations
separately from continuing operations. The presentation prescribed for discontinued operations
requires the collapsing of healthcare revenues and expenses, as well as other specifically
identifiable costs, into the income or loss from discontinued operations. Items such as indirect
selling, general and administrative expenses or interest expense cannot be allocated to expired
contracts. The application of the SFAS No.&nbsp;144 accounting presentation to expired contracts has no
impact on net income, earnings per share, total cash flows or stockholders&#146; equity. As a result of
the application of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;healthcare revenues&#148; and &#147;healthcare expenses&#148; on the Company&#146;s
consolidated statements of operations for any period presented will only include revenues and
expenses from continuing contracts.

$148.3&nbsp;million, or 28.7%, from $516.8&nbsp;million in 2003 to $665.1&nbsp;million in 2004. Healthcare
revenues in 2004 included $100.3&nbsp;million of revenue growth resulting from seven new correctional
healthcare services contracts added in 2004 and 2003 through marketing activities. Correctional
healthcare services contracts in place at December&nbsp;31, 2002 and in continuing operations at
December&nbsp;31, 2004, produced an increase in revenue of $48.3&nbsp;million during 2004 as the result of
contract renegotiations and automatic price adjustments. Correctional healthcare services
contracts in place throughout the entire year during both 2004 and 2003, including any correctional
healthcare services contracts that terminated on December&nbsp;31, 2004 which are classified as
discontinued operations, experienced healthcare revenue growth of 10.9%. Offsetting these revenue
increases, SPP pharmaceutical distribution revenue decreased $0.3&nbsp;million primarily as a result of
a distribution customer lost in the third quarter of 2003. As discussed in the discontinued
operations section below, all healthcare services contracts that have expired or otherwise been
terminated subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2002 have been classified as discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare expenses. </I>Healthcare expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 increased
$137.0&nbsp;million, or 28.4%, from $482.4&nbsp;million in 2003 to $619.4&nbsp;million in 2004. Expenses related
to new correctional healthcare services contracts added in 2003 and 2004 through marketing
activities accounted for $88.8&nbsp;million of the increase. Healthcare expenses as a percentage of
revenues decreased by 0.2% in 2004 as compared to 2003. This percentage decrease results primarily
from increased healthcare revenues associated with the Company&#146;s ongoing efforts, when renewing or
negotiating contracts, to negotiate risk-sharing arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions and
aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical costs. Approximately $6.7&nbsp;million and $4.0&nbsp;million
in negative operating margin related to the Company&#146;s loss contracts was charged against the loss
contract reserve during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Increase in reserve for loss contracts. </I>The Company&#146;s contract with the Maryland DPS has
historically underperformed, fluctuating between minimal profitability, breakeven and losses. This
contract was entered into on July&nbsp;1, 2000, to provide comprehensive medical services to four
regions of the Maryland prison system. The initial term of the contract was for the three years
ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, with the Maryland DPS having the ability to renew the contract for two
additional one-year terms. The contract is presently in its second renewal term and is
non-cancelable by the Company. The Maryland DPS pays the Company a flat fee per month with certain
limited cost-sharing adjustments for staffing costs, primarily nurses, and the cost of medications
related to certain specific illnesses. The Company is fully at risk for increases in
hospitalization and outpatient costs under the terms of the contract with the Maryland DPS. The
contract also contains provisions that allow the Maryland DPS to assess penalties if certain
staffing or performance criteria are not maintained. The flat fee paid to the Company is increased
annually based on a portion of the consumer price index.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the flat fee nature of this contract, the Company&#146;s margin under the contract can be
significantly impacted by changes in healthcare costs, utilization trends or inmate population.
The Company incurred losses under this contract in April&nbsp;2004 at a level slightly above
expectations. The losses under the contract increased significantly in May&nbsp;2004 to approximately
$1.1&nbsp;million for the month. The primary cause for the increased loss was an unanticipated increase
in hospitalization costs beginning in May, resulting from the volume and acuity of services being
provided, the number of HIV and mental health patients and the costs associated with current
treatment guidelines. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss
contract charge of $6.8&nbsp;million, effective June&nbsp;1, 2004, which represented its &#147;most likely&#148;
estimate, at that date, of the future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland
DPS contract through its expiration on June&nbsp;30, 2005. This estimate assumed monthly losses under
the contract would diminish from the May&nbsp;2004 level, which was viewed as an aberration, to
approximately $0.5&nbsp;million per month, including allocated overhead, an amount significantly above
recent historical levels.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2004, the Company utilized $2.6&nbsp;million of its loss contract
reserve, almost entirely due to the underperformance of the Maryland DPS contract. While actual
monthly losses incurred under the Maryland DPS contract had trended downward from the record loss
in May, losses once again increased in September, driven primarily by off-site medical costs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off-site medical costs under the Maryland DPS contract averaged $1.3&nbsp;million per month for
June through September&nbsp;2004, as compared with initial estimates of $1.0&nbsp;million per month, based on
historical results. As a result of this new and more severe trend, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $6.0&nbsp;million, effective September&nbsp;30, 2004, to increase its reserve for estimated future
losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland DPS contract until its expiration in
June&nbsp;2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selling, general and administrative expenses. </I>Selling, general and administrative expenses
for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2004 increased $2.6&nbsp;million from $14.9&nbsp;million, or 2.9% of
revenue, in 2003 to $17.5&nbsp;million, or 2.6% of revenue, in 2004. The percentage of revenue
decrease is primarily the result of the increase in healthcare revenues partially offset by
expenses recorded in connection with the Company&#146;s implementation of the corporate governance
requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act during 2004 and expenses recorded in
connection with the EMSA lease matter discussed in Part&nbsp;I &#150; Item&nbsp;3 &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Approximately $0.8&nbsp;million and $0.5&nbsp;million in overhead costs associated with the Company&#146;s
loss contracts were charged against the loss contract reserve during the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Depreciation and amortization. </I>Depreciation and amortization expense decreased from $4.2
million in 2003 to $3.9&nbsp;million in 2004, primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a
result of assets becoming fully depreciated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Charge for settlement of Florida legal matter. </I>One of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries, EMSA
Limited Partnership, entered into a settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office
on March&nbsp;30, 2004, related to allegations, first raised in connection with an investigation of EMSA
Correctional Services (&#147;EMSA&#148;) in 1997, that the Company may have played an indirect role in the
improper billing of Medicaid by independent providers treating incarcerated patients. The Company
acquired EMSA in 1999. EMSA was a party to several contracts to provide healthcare to inmates at
Florida correctional facilities. Typically, in those contracts, which were approved by government
lawyers, the clients required EMSA to seek all available third party reimbursement for medical
services provided to inmates, specifically including Medicaid. It was the implementation of these
contract requirements that the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office alleged was improper.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office constitutes a complete
resolution and settlement of the claims asserted against EMSA and required EMSA Limited Partnership
to pay $5.0&nbsp;million to the State of Florida. This payment was made by the Company on March&nbsp;30,
2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company and all of its subsidiaries are
released from liability for any alleged actions which might have occurred from December&nbsp;1, 1998 to
March&nbsp;31, 2004. Both parties entered into the settlement agreement to avoid the delay,
uncertainty, inconvenience and expense of protracted litigation. The settlement agreement states
that it is not punitive in purpose or effect, it should not be construed or used as admission of
any fault, wrongdoing or liability whatsoever, and that EMSA specifically denies intentionally
submitting any medical claims in violation of state or federal law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recorded a charge of $5.2&nbsp;million in its results of operations for the first
quarter of 2004, reflecting the settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office and
related legal expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest, net. </I>Net interest expense decreased to $1.7&nbsp;million or 0.2% of revenue in 2004 from
$3.7&nbsp;million or 0.7% of revenue in 2003 as a result of a reduction in borrowings outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income tax provision (benefit). </I>The income tax benefit for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004
was $3.5&nbsp;million or 0.5% of revenue as compared to an income tax provision of $0.8&nbsp;million or 0.2%
of revenue in 2003. During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company recorded an income tax
benefit of $5.3&nbsp;million which resulted from the reversal, effective June&nbsp;30, 2004, of substantially
all of the valuation allowance previously established for its net deferred tax assets. This credit
has been partially offset by a tax provision recorded for the last
six months of the year and recognition of a tax
contingency reserve of approximately $0.5&nbsp;million. Prior to June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company maintained
a 100% valuation allowance, established in the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2001, related to its net
deferred tax assets. As a result of the valuation allowance in place during 2003, the income tax
provision for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 primarily reflects state income taxes paid and is
significantly lower than the Company&#146;s statutory tax rate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income from continuing operations. </I>Income from continuing operations for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 was $8.0&nbsp;million, or 1.2% of revenue, as compared with $11.0&nbsp;million, or 2.1% of
revenue in 2003. The decrease is due to the factors discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes</I>. Income from discontinued operations for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 was $1.0&nbsp;million, or 0.2% of revenue, as compared with $0.9
million, or 0.2% of revenue in 2003. Income from discontinued operations represents the operating
results of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services contracts that have expired or otherwise
been terminated. The classification of these expired contracts is the result of the Company&#146;s
adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 effective January&nbsp;1, 2002. See Note 5 of the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of SFAS No.&nbsp;144. Approximately $0.1&nbsp;million and $3.7
million in negative operating margin related to the Company&#146;s loss contracts classified as
discontinued operations was charged against the loss contract reserve during the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter of 2003, the Company utilized its loss contract reserve at a rate
greater than previously anticipated. This increase in utilization was primarily the result of an
unexpected increase in healthcare expenses associated with the Company&#146;s contract to provide
services to the Kansas DOC. The primary causes for the increase in healthcare expenses in this
contract were hospitalization and outpatient costs. As a result of the utilization increase, the
Company increased its reserve for loss contracts by $4.5&nbsp;million, as of June&nbsp;30, 2003, to cover
estimated future losses that may occur under the Kansas DOC contract which was to expire in June
2005.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in income from discontinued operations for 2003 is a third quarter decrease in
the reserve for loss contracts of $1.7&nbsp;million. On August&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company entered into an
assignment and novation agreement with the Kansas DOC to assign the Kansas DOC contract to HCS
effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. The Company also entered into a general assignment, novation and
assumption agreement with HCS to transfer the Kansas DOC contract to HCS, effective October&nbsp;1,
2003. Beginning October&nbsp;1, 2003, HCS became solely responsible for the performance of the Kansas
DOC contract, and the Company has no obligation to the Kansas DOC or to HCS related to HCS&#146;
performance of the contract. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s agreement with HCS, the Company
agreed to pay HCS net consideration of $5.6&nbsp;million in 21&nbsp;monthly installments, commencing October
31, 2003, and continuing through June&nbsp;30, 2005. The net consideration of $5.6&nbsp;million is comprised
of payments of $6.5&nbsp;million to assume the Company&#146;s obligations under the Kansas DOC contract, less
$0.9&nbsp;million of fixed assets and inventory purchased from the Company by HCS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second quarter increase in the reserve of $4.5&nbsp;million and the third quarter decrease of
$1.7&nbsp;million in the reserve for loss contracts are reflected as components of income from
discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Net income. </I>Net income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 was $9.0&nbsp;million or 1.4% of
revenue, as compared with net income of $11.9&nbsp;million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2003. The decrease
is due to the factors discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2002</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare revenues. </I>Healthcare revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 increased
$106.9&nbsp;million, or 26.1%, from $409.9&nbsp;million in 2002 to $516.8&nbsp;million in 2003. Healthcare
revenues in 2003 included $49.1&nbsp;million of revenue growth resulting from new correctional
healthcare services contracts added in 2003 and 2002. Correctional healthcare services contracts
in place at December&nbsp;31, 2001 and in continuing operations at December&nbsp;31, 2004, produced an
increase in revenue of $45.7&nbsp;million during 2003 as the result of contract renegotiations and
automatic price adjustments. Correctional healthcare services contracts in place throughout the
entire year during both 2003 and 2002, including any correctional healthcare services contracts
that terminated on December&nbsp;31, 2003 or during 2004 which are classified as discontinued
operations, experienced healthcare revenue growth of 12.4%. SPP pharmaceutical distribution
revenue increased $12.1&nbsp;million as the result of new customers added in 2003 and 2002. As
discussed in the discontinued operations section below, all healthcare services contracts that have
expired or otherwise been terminated subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2002 have been classified as
discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare expenses. </I>Healthcare expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 increased $96.5
million, or 25.0%, from $385.9&nbsp;million in 2002 to $482.4&nbsp;million in 2003. Expenses related to new
correctional healthcare services contracts added in 2002 and 2003 through marketing activities
accounted for $37.6&nbsp;million of the increase. Healthcare expenses as a percentage of revenues
decreased by 0.9% in 2003 as compared to 2002. This percentage decrease results primarily from
increased healthcare revenues associated with the Company&#146;s ongoing efforts, when renewing or
negotiating contracts, to negotiate risk-sharing arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions and
aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical costs. Approximately $4.0&nbsp;million and $4.8&nbsp;million
in negative operating margin related to the Company&#146;s loss contracts was charged against the loss
contract reserve during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Reduction in reserve for loss contracts</I>. In June&nbsp;2002, the Company and the City of
Philadelphia reached a mutual agreement that the contract between PHS and the City of Philadelphia
would expire effective June&nbsp;30, 2002. As a result of the earlier than anticipated expiration of
this loss contract, the Company performed a reassessment of its loss contract reserve
requirements. This reassessment included a review of management&#146;s projected future losses under
the then remaining three loss contracts as well as a comprehensive review of the Company&#146;s
portfolio of contracts at June&nbsp;30, 2002 for the purpose of identifying any additional loss
contracts. No new loss contracts were identified as a result of this review. Based upon the
reassessment, the Company recorded a gain of $3.3&nbsp;million, in the second quarter of 2002, to
reduce its reserve for loss contracts. From July&nbsp;1, 2002 to September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company
provided services to the City of Philadelphia under a transition arrangement. Subsequent to
September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company is continuing to provide healthcare services to the City of
Philadelphia under modified contract terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selling, general and administrative expenses. </I>Selling, general and administrative expenses
for year ending December&nbsp;31, 2003 increased $0.5&nbsp;million from $14.4&nbsp;million, or 3.5% of revenues,
in 2002 to $14.9&nbsp;million, or 2.9% of revenues, in 2003. Approximately $0.5&nbsp;million and $1.2
million in overhead costs associated with the Company&#146;s loss contracts was charged against the loss
contract reserve during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Depreciation and amortization. </I>Depreciation and amortization expense decreased from $4.7
million in 2002 to $4.2&nbsp;million in 2003. This overall decrease is primarily the result of an
increase in amortization in the second half of 2002, due to an adjustment of the estimated life for
a portion of the Company&#146;s contract intangibles from 20&nbsp;years to 10&nbsp;years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest, net. </I>Net interest expense decreased to $3.7&nbsp;million or 0.7% of revenue in 2003 from
$5.8&nbsp;million or 1.4% of revenue in 2002 primarily as a result of a reduction in borrowings
outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Charge for early retirement of debt</I>. On October&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company entered into a new $60
million revolving credit and term loan agreement. An initial advance pursuant to the new agreement
was used to retire all indebtedness outstanding under the Company&#146;s previous secured credit
facility. The Company incurred a one-time charge of $0.7&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for
early debt retirement. The charge represents the write-off of the remaining unamortized loan
arrangement fees related to the Company&#146;s previous secured credit facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income tax provision. </I>The provision for income taxes for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 was
$0.8&nbsp;million or 0.2% of revenue, as compared $0.3&nbsp;million or 0.1% of revenue in 2002. These
amounts represent state income taxes paid and are significantly lower than the Company&#146;s statutory
tax rate due to the valuation allowance that was applied to the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets
during those periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income from continuing operations. </I>Income from continuing operations for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2003 was $11.0&nbsp;million, or 2.1% of revenue, as compared with $1.3&nbsp;million, or 0.3% of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes</I>. Income from discontinued operations for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 was $0.9&nbsp;million, or 0.2% of revenue, as compared with $10.6
million, or 2.6% of revenue in 2002. Income from discontinued operations represents the operating
results of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services contracts that have expired or otherwise
been terminated. The classification of these expired contracts is the result of the Company&#146;s
adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 effective January&nbsp;1, 2002. See Note 5 of the Company&#146;s consolidated
financial statements for further discussion of SFAS No.&nbsp;144. Approximately $3.7 and $2.4&nbsp;million
in negative operating margin related to the Company&#146;s loss contracts classified as discontinued
operations was charged against the loss contract reserve during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

at a rate greater than previously anticipated thereby increasing its reserve for loss contracts by
$4.5&nbsp;million. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2003, the Company decreased its reserve for
loss contracts by $1.7&nbsp;million related to the assignment and novation agreement with the Kansas DOC
to assign the Kansas DOC contract to HCS effective October&nbsp;1, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second quarter of 2003 increase in the reserve of $4.5&nbsp;million and the third quarter of

$19.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003. The improvement in working capital of $15.5&nbsp;million in 2004 was
primarily the result of cash flows from operations of $9.8&nbsp;million and an increase of $3.9&nbsp;million
in current deferred tax assets which represents the amount by which net operating loss
carryforwards were increased in 2004 as a result of the reversal of the Company&#146;s previously
recorded deferred tax valuation allowance related to the deferred tax benefits resulting from the
exercise of employee stock options. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 50 at

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company generated net income of $9.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 compared
to net income of $11.9&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Company had stockholders&#146;
equity of $55.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2004 as compared to $39.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003.
The Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalents increased to $7.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2004 from $1.2
million at December&nbsp;31, 2003, an increase of $6.0&nbsp;million. The increase in cash was primarily the
result of cash flows from operations. The Company&#146;s outstanding balance on its Revolver and Term
Loan totaling $3.6&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003 was reduced to zero at December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows from operating activities represent the year to date net income plus depreciation
and amortization, changes in various components of working capital and adjustments for various
non-cash charges, such as increases or reductions in the reserve for loss contracts. Cash flows
from operating activities decreased to $9.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 from $22.4
million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities
of $12.6&nbsp;million was primarily due to a $5.2&nbsp;million settlement related to a Florida legal matter
discussed above and an increase of $31.9&nbsp;million in outstanding accounts receivable which resulted
from a combination of certain client receivables becoming past due and an increase in risk sharing
receivables not yet billable to clients based on stated contract terms. These negative factors
were offset by an increase of $23.5 in accounts payable and accrued medical claims liability.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in investing activities were $2.7&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts represent purchases of property and
equipment, which were financed through working capital.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 were $1.0
million and include net payments totaling $3.6&nbsp;million to reduce the amount of debt outstanding
from $3.6&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003 to $0 at December&nbsp;31, 2004. Also included in cash flows
used in financing activities during 2004 were cash receipts of $2.5&nbsp;million resulting from stock
option exercises and the issuance of common stock under an employee stock purchase plan and $0.1
million in proceeds from stockholders&#146; notes receivable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Credit Facility</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company entered into a new credit facility with CapitalSource Finance
LLC (the &#147;CapitalSource Credit Facility&#148;). The CapitalSource Credit Facility matures on October
31, 2005 and includes a $55.0&nbsp;million revolving credit facility (the &#147;Revolver&#148;) and, prior to the
third quarter of 2004, also included a $5.0&nbsp;million term loan (the &#147;Term Loan&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2003, the Company and CapitalSource Finance LLC entered into an amendment to the
CapitalSource Credit Facility. Under the terms of the amendment, the Company may have standby
letters of credit issued under the loan agreement in amounts up to $10.0&nbsp;million. The amount
available to the Company for borrowings under the CapitalSource Credit Facility is reduced by the
amount of each outstanding standby letter of credit. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had
outstanding standby letters of credit totaling $4.0&nbsp;million, which were used to collateralize
performance bonds.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and
its operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under
the Revolver and $45.6&nbsp;million available for additional borrowing, based on the Company&#146;s
collateral base on that date and outstanding standby letters of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Revolver are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of eligible receivables (as
defined in the Revolver) or (2) $55.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;Revolver Capacity&#148;). Interest under the
Revolver is payable monthly at the greater of 5.75% or the Citibank N.A. prime rate plus 1.0%. The
Company is also required to pay a monthly collateral management fee, equal to an annual rate of
1.38%, on average borrowings outstanding under the Revolver. Additionally, the Company is required
to pay a monthly letter of credit fee equal to an annual rate of 3.5% on the outstanding balance of
letters of credit issued pursuant to the Revolver.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the CapitalSource Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a monthly
unused line fee equal to an annual rate of 0.6% on the Revolver Capacity less the actual average
borrowings outstanding under the Revolver for the month and the balance of any outstanding letters
of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2004, the Company prepaid the remaining balance of $2.1&nbsp;million
and retired its Term Loan which was set to mature on October&nbsp;31, 2005. In conjunction with the
retirement of the Term Loan, the Company paid a $0.1&nbsp;million loan fee which was due upon maturity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility requires the Company to achieve a minimum level of EBITDA of
$3.0&nbsp;million on a rolling three-month measurement period. The CapitalSource Credit Facility
defines EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation expense,
amortization expense, any other non-cash non-recurring expense and loss from asset sales outside of
the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">normal course of business, minus gains on asset sales outside the normal course of business,
non-recurring gains, and utilization of the Company&#146;s loss contract reserve.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio of 1.5 on a rolling three-month basis. The CapitalSource Credit Facility defines
the fixed charge coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal
payments on outstanding debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, cash
income taxes paid or accrued, and cash dividends paid or accrued or declared. In addition, the
Company is required to maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio of 1.75 calculated using the most
recent twelve-month period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility also contains restrictions on the Company with respect to
certain types of transactions, including acquisition of the Company&#146;s own stock, payment of
dividends, indebtedness and sales or transfers of assets.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s credit facility with CapitalSource Finance LLC expires
on October 31, 2005. As a result, the Company will be required to
replace this credit facility during 2005. No assurances can be made
that the Company can obtain replacement financing arrangements on
terms acceptable to it, or at all.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contractual Obligations And Commercial Commitments</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has certain contractual obligations as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, summarized by the
period in which payment is due, as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amounts included in the table above do not include future cash payments for interest.
At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company was contingently liable for $22.5&nbsp;million of performance bonds.
The performance bonds are collateralized by the standby letters of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Off-Balance Sheet Transactions</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing transactions
or arrangements except the $4.0&nbsp;million standby letters of credit utilized to secure performance
bonds.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Inflation</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Company&#146;s contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed base fee based upon
changes in the regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts
that extend beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of its
cost of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. If the rate of
inflation exceeds the levels projected, the excess costs will be absorbed by the Company with the
financial impact dependent upon contract structure. Conversely, the Company may benefit should the
actual rate of inflation fall below the estimate used in the bidding and negotiation process.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.&nbsp;46R, <I>Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities</I>, or FIN No.&nbsp;46. This interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of
variable interest entities when certain characteristics are present. The Company adopted the
provisions of FIN No.&nbsp;46 effective January&nbsp;1, 2004. Such adoption did not impact the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123
(revised 2004), <I>Share-Based Payment </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R)&#148;), which is a revision of SFAS No.&nbsp;123. SFAS
No.&nbsp;123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options and any compensatory discounts received by employees in connection with stock purchased
under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their
fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer appropriate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) must be adopted no later than July&nbsp;1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted
in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company expects to adopt
SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) on July&nbsp;1, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) permits the Company to adopt its requirements using one of two methods, a
modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method. When applying the modified
prospective method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the
requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and
based

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">on the requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective
date of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. The modified retrospective
method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also
permits the Company to restate, based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No.&nbsp;123 for
purposes of pro forma disclosures, either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of
the year of adoption. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) using the modified prospective
method.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As permitted by SFAS No.&nbsp;123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using APB No.&nbsp;25&#146;s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no
compensation cost for employee stock options. The impact of adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) cannot be
predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the
future. However, had the Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that
standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No.&nbsp;123 as described in the disclosure of pro
forma net income and earnings per share in Note 2 of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) also requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow,
rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement may
reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption.
While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future, the amount of operating
cash flows recognized in 2004 for such excess tax deductions was $0.5&nbsp;million. No amounts were
recognized in the Company&#146;s cash flows statements for 2003 and 2002 as the Company had a deferred
tax valuation allowance in those years.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial statements
of the Company due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. The Company&#146;s
exposure to market risk is primarily related to changes in the variable interest rate under the
CapitalSource Credit Facility. The CapitalSource Credit Facility carries an interest rate based on
the Citibank N.A. prime rate, subject to a minimum stated interest rate; therefore the Company&#146;s
cash flow may be affected by changes in the prime rate. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, a
hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rate would have had no effect on interest
expense paid under the Credit Facility, as the resulting interest rate would have remained below
the minimum stated interest rate. Interest expense represents 0.2% and 0.7% of the Company&#146;s
revenues, respectively, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003. The Company has no debt
outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure controls and procedures are the Company&#146;s controls and other procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company evaluated under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures,
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;13a-14 and Rule&nbsp;13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information that is required to be
included in the Company&#146;s periodic SEC filings.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules&nbsp;13a &#150; 15(f).
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company&#146;s
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework, management concluded
that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of December&nbsp;31, 2004 has been audited by Ernst &#038; Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 31.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Changes in Internal Controls</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been no changes in the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting during
the period covered by this annual report that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.

on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors and Stockholders of America Service Group Inc.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have audited management&#146;s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that America Service Group Inc. (the
&#147;Company&#148;) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the &#147;COSO criteria&#148;). The Company&#146;s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management&#146;s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, management&#146;s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, based on the COSO
criteria.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors and Stockholders of America Service Group Inc.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America Service Group Inc.
(the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule referenced at Item
15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of America Service Group Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2004
and 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects the information set forth therein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>1. Description of Business</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America Service Group Inc. (&#147;ASG&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) and its consolidated subsidiaries provide
managed healthcare services to correctional facilities under contracts with state and local
governments, certain private entities and a medical facility operated by the Veterans
Administration. The health status of inmates impacts the results of operations under such
contractual arrangements. In addition to providing managed healthcare services, the Company also
provides pharmaceutical distribution services through one of its operating subsidiaries, Secure
Pharmacy Plus, LLC.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Principles of Consolidation</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, Prison Health Services, Inc. (&#147;PHS&#148;), EMSA Limited Partnership, Correctional
Health Services, LLC (&#147;CHS&#148;), Prison Health Services of Indiana, LLC and Secure Pharmacy Plus, LLC
(&#147;SPP&#148;). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Use of Estimates</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the more significant
areas requiring estimates in the financial statements include the recording of the accruals of
unbilled medical services calculated based upon a claims payment lag methodology, allowance for
doubtful accounts, loss contract reserves, legal contingencies and employee health, workers&#146;
compensation and professional and general liability claims for which the Company is substantially
self-insured. Estimates change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, or additional
information is obtained. A change in an estimate is accounted for in the period of change.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying amounts of the Company&#146;s financial instruments reported in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities and long-term debt, approximate their fair values.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts
with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing arrangements, such as stop-loss
provisions and aggregate limits for off-site medical services or pharmaceutical costs. Such
contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and generally
may be terminated by either party at will and without cause upon proper notice. Revenues earned
under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are
rendered. Cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and
recognized as income when the service is performed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a margin. For fixed fee contracts,
revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service contract. Revenues
for population based contracts are calculated either as a fixed fee adjusted using a per diem rate
for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate
times the average inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus contracts, revenues
are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual
margin.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a portion of the
Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in the majority
of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools for off-site expenses, stop loss provisions,
cost plus fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of off-site service costs.
Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically
under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue under the contract increases to offset
increases in specified cost categories such as off-site expenses or pharmaceutical costs. For
contracts which include such provisions, the Company recognizes the additional revenues that would
be due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract to date costs incurred as
compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs. Because such provisions
typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and require all such additional
revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the additional revenues are initially
recorded as unbilled receivables until the time period for billing has been met and actual costs
are known. Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates of incurred costs and the actual costs
are recorded in the period in which such differences become known along with the corresponding
adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from performance or staffing related criteria. If necessary,
the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods when the actual amount of
the adjustment is determined.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon
delivery of the related products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and other healthcare
professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing the managed
care including the costs of professional and general liability insurance and other self-funded
insurance reserves discussed more fully below. The cost of healthcare services provided or
contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided based in part on estimates,
including an accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet
date. The Company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization
data including hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and emergency room and
ambulance visits and their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the average historical
cost of such services. An actuarial analysis is also prepared periodically by an independent
actuary to evaluate the adequacy of the Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have
sufficient claims payment history. The analysis takes into account historical claims experience
(including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial
data. Additionally, the Company&#146;s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of
inpatient hospital stays in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the
historical average rates. Once identified, reserves for such stays are determined which take into
consideration the specific facts of the stay.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the
healthcare cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of
claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual
claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are
made. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a decrease of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million and
increases of approximately $888,000 and $617,000, respectively, to its prior year claims
liabilities as a result of differences between actual and estimated claims experience.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, reserves have been recorded for the Company&#146;s self-insurance retention for
certain reported and unreported professional and general liability claims associated with the
delivery of medical services and included in accrued expenses and noncurrent portion of accrued
expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss
has been incurred (i.e., expected future healthcare costs and maintenance costs will exceed
anticipated future revenue) and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company
performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis (see Note 4).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, money market funds and
investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company
maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances primarily with one high credit quality financial
institution. The Company manages its credit exposure by placing its investments in high quality
securities and by periodically evaluating the relative credit standing of the financial
institution.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Accounts Receivable</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable represent amounts due from state and local governments and certain
private entities for healthcare services provided by the Company and pharmaceutical sales of the
Company. Included in unbilled accounts receivable is the Company&#146;s estimate of revenue earned
under risk sharing provisions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. The Company recognizes
allowances for doubtful accounts to ensure receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility.
Bad debt reserves are established based on a variety of factors, including the length of time
receivables are past due, significant one-time events, discussions
with clients and historical experience. If circumstances
change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Inventories</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmacy and medical supplies inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Property and Equipment</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense as incurred, whereas expenditures for improvements and replacements are capitalized. The
cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the
accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Software Costs</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
Position 98-1, <I>Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use</I>, the Company capitalizes costs associated with internally developed software systems that have
reached the application development stage. Capitalized costs include external direct costs of
materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use software and payroll and
payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the
internal-use software project. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project
stage is complete and ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially
complete and ready for its intended purpose.

Intangible Assets </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;142&#148;), goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for
impairment on an annual basis, at December&nbsp;31 of each year, or more frequently whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Important factors taken
into consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review, other than the required
annual review, include the following:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired based upon the
existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment or as a result of its annual
impairment review, any impairment is measured using a fair-value-based goodwill impairment test as
required under the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;142. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could
be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a
number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value
techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value
of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation
techniques.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of its annual review at December&nbsp;31, 2004, management has determined
that goodwill is not impaired. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and that goodwill is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a
material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Contracts and Other Intangibles</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its contract and other intangibles
when events and circumstances warrant, generally in conjunction with the annual business planning
cycle. If the carrying value of the evaluated asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized
based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value. Fair market value
is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company amortizes its contract intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life. Contract amortization expense totaled approximately $1.6&nbsp;million, $1.6&nbsp;million and
$1.9&nbsp;million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The estimated useful life of the Company&#146;s
contract intangibles was determined by an independent appraisal at the time of the acquisition.
Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its
contract intangibles on at least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and
circumstances related to its retention rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and
circumstances indicate the current estimated life is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the
estimated useful life on a prospective basis. For periods prior to July&nbsp;1, 2002, the estimated
useful life of the Company&#146;s contract intangibles was 20&nbsp;years. In the third quarter of 2002, the
Company revised the estimated life of the contract intangibles, acquired in its 1999 acquisition
of EMSA Government Services, Inc., from 20&nbsp;years to 10&nbsp;years. The revised life impacted contract
intangibles with a gross value of $11.2&nbsp;million and resulted in an increase to amortization
expense of approximately $434,000, or $0.05 per fully diluted share, for the year ended December
31, 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other intangibles are comprised primarily of non-compete agreements. Amortization of
non-compete agreements is calculated over the term of the related agreements (2 to 10&nbsp;years) and
approximates $200,000 for each of the three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Other Assets</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003 include cash deposits totaling $12.0&nbsp;million and
$15.8&nbsp;million, respectively, which are held by the Company&#146;s professional liability insurer. In
addition to cash deposits recorded within other assets, the Company has recorded cash deposits for
professional liability claims losses totaling $5.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2004 within prepaid
expenses and other current assets. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s professional liability
insurance policies for 2004, 2003 and 2002, this cash will be used by the insurer to pay any
professional liability claims made against the Company during those years. Each policy includes a
retro-premium adjustment under the terms of which any cash deposits in excess of the ultimate
losses incurred under these policies after a 42&nbsp;month period will be refunded to the Company. As
discussed further in the Professional and General Liability Insurance section of this Note and
Note 20, management monitors the Company&#146;s estimated exposure related to claims made under the
policies using external and internal evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis
of claim history and the estimated reserves assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator.
Based on this information, management estimates the amount of cash deposits that will be utilized
by the insurer to pay losses and the amount that will ultimately be refunded to the Company at the
end of the 42-month settlement period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003 are deferred financing costs
associated with the Company&#146;s credit facility executed in October&nbsp;2002 (see Note 13). Such costs
are being amortized over the life of the credit facility and are included in interest expense on
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization expense associated with
deferred financing costs was approximately $576,000, $566,000 and $1.0&nbsp;million for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The amortization expense in 2002 also included
amortization of deferred finance costs associated with a prior credit facility. As discussed
further in Note 13, the remaining balance of these costs associated with the prior credit facility
was written-off in the fourth quarter of 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Long-Lived Assets</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;), requires the Company to consider whether
indicators of impairment of long-lived assets held for use (including the Company&#146;s property and
equipment, contracts and other intangibles) are present. If such indicators are present, the
Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to
such assets is less than their carrying amount, and if so, recognizes an impairment loss based on
the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value. Accordingly, management
periodically evaluates the ongoing value of property and equipment and intangible assets and
considers events, circumstances and operating results, including consideration of contract
performance at the fixed

impaired, management adjusts the asset value to fair value.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;109&#148;). Under the asset and liability method of SFAS
No.&nbsp;109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; It further states &#147;forming a conclusion that a
valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative
losses in recent years.&#148; Since December&nbsp;31, 2001 and until June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company maintained a
100% valuation allowance equal to their net deferred tax assets, after considering deferred tax
assets that could be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the Company&#146;s results of operations since December&nbsp;31, 2001, and its expected
profitability in this and future years, the Company concluded, effective June&nbsp;30, 2004, that it is
more likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets will be realized. As a
result, in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to
such net deferred tax assets was reversed in the second quarter of 2004. Reversal of the valuation
allowance resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2004 totaling $5.3
million. This benefit represented the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax assets,
excluding those deferred tax assets that resulted from the exercise of employee stock options. The
reversal of the valuation allowance that related to the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax
assets resulting from the exercises of employee stock options totaled $3.9&nbsp;million and was recorded
as a direct increase to additional paid-in capital in the stockholders&#146; equity portion of the
Company&#146;s balance sheet as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company&#146;s valuation
allowance of approximately $175,000 represents management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss
carryforwards which will expire unused.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that
the Company&#146;s tax return positions are fully supported, the Company believes that certain positions
will be challenged and a risk exists that the Company&#146;s positions will not be fully sustained. The
tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of tax audits, case law, and emerging legislation. The Company&#146;s tax contingency accruals
are reflected as a component of accrued liabilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-Insurance Retention</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company is subject to medical malpractice claims and lawsuits.
The most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits brought by
inmates alleging lack of timely or adequate healthcare services. The Company may also be liable,
as employer, for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or the healthcare
professionals it engages as independent contractors. The Company&#146;s contracts generally require it
to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the
Company or its agents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains its primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. However, due to the use of a large
deductible in 2001 and the use of adjustable premium policies in 2002, 2003 and 2004 the Company is
self-insured for professional liability claims incurred under its primary program. In addition to
its primary program, the Company also has insurance policies that related to certain specific
healthcare services contracts. For 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Company is covered by separate
policies, each of which contains a 42-month retro-premium with adjustment based on actual losses
after 42&nbsp;months. The Company&#146;s ultimate premium for its 2002, 2003 and 2004 policies will depend
on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods. Reserves for
estimated losses related to known claims are provided for on an undiscounted basis using internal
and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis of claim history and the
estimated reserves assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator. Any adjustments resulting
from the review are reflected in current earnings.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but
not reported claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an
undiscounted basis. The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by an independent
actuarial analysis, which is obtained on a quarterly basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company&#146;s reserves for known and incurred but not reported claims
totaled $18.7&nbsp;million. Reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number of
claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next.
Furthermore, payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the
estimated liability. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and
differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to
the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which the estimates are changed or
payments are made. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded increases of
approximately $4.7&nbsp;million, $719,000 and $285,000, respectively, to its prior year claims reserves
as a result of adverse development. The 2004 increase primarily relates to adverse development in
eight claims. The reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the
third-party insurance carriers used by the Company. If a third party insurance carrier fails to
meet its contractual obligations under the agreement with the Company, the Company would then be
responsible for such obligations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Other Self-funded Insurance Reserves</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company has approximately $8.8&nbsp;million in accrued liabilities for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. The Company is essentially self-insured for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain individual case stop loss
levels. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and the ability
to control claims. The Company accrues the estimated liability for employee health insurance based
on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between the incident date and the date
of actual claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated liability for workers&#146; compensation
claims based on internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis
of claims history and the estimated reserves assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator.
On a periodic basis, the Company obtains an independent actuarial analysis to further support the
appropriateness of the workers&#146; compensation reserve. These estimates of self-funded insurance reserves could change in the future based on
changes in the factors discussed above. Any adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are reflected in current earnings. In 2004,
2003 and 2002, the Company recorded an increase of approximately $0.2 million and decreases of approximately $0.8 million
and $0.3 million, respectively, to its prior year other self-insurance reserves as a result of differences between
actual and estimated claims experience.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Comprehensive Income</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive income encompasses all changes in stockholders&#146; equity (except those arising
from transactions with owners) and includes net income, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives
that qualify as hedges, net unrealized capital gains or losses on available for sale securities
and foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company&#146;s comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;is
presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders&#146; Equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Stock Options</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion (&#147;APB&#148;) No.&nbsp;25,
<I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees</I>, and related Interpretations in accounting for its
employee stock options. Under APB No.&nbsp;25, compensation expense is generally recognized as the
difference between the exercise price of the Company&#146;s employee stock options and the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of grant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, <I>Accounting for Stock Based Compensation </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;123&#148;),
which also requires that the information be determined as if the Company has accounted for its
employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS No.&nbsp;123. The fair value of these options
issued in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

future years. The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002, as
determined under the fair value provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123, is $14.71, $6.88 and $4.05,
respectively. For the periods prior to July&nbsp;1, 2004, the above pro forma adjustments do not
include any offsetting income tax benefits due to the Company&#146;s use of a tax valuation allowance
during those periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123
(revised 2004), <I>Share-Based Payment </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R)&#148;), which is a revision of SFAS No.&nbsp;123. SFAS
No.&nbsp;123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options and any compensatory discounts received by employees in connection with stock purchased
under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their
fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer appropriate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) must be adopted no later than July&nbsp;1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted
in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company expects to adopt
SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) on July&nbsp;1, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) permits the Company to adopt its requirements using one of two methods, a
modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method. When applying the modified
prospective method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the
requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and
based on the requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
effective date of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. The modified
retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above,
but also permits the Company to restate, based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No.
123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures, either all prior periods presented or prior interim
periods of the year of adoption. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) using the modified
prospective method.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As permitted by SFAS No.&nbsp;123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using APB No.&nbsp;25&#146;s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no
compensation cost for employee stock options. The impact of adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) cannot be
predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">in the future. However, had
the Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) in prior periods, the impact
of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No.&nbsp;123 as described in the disclosure
of pro forma net income and earnings per share above. SFAS
No.&nbsp;123(R) also requires the benefits
of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash
flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement
may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after
adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future, the amount
of operating cash flows recognized in 2004 for such excess tax deductions was $541,000. No amounts
were recognized in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of cash flows for 2003 and 2002 as the
Company had a deferred tax valuation allowance in those years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Credit and Other Concentration Risks</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s credit risks relate primarily to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,
accounts receivable and deposits on professional liability and other insurance programs. Cash and
cash equivalents and restricted cash are primarily held in bank accounts and overnight
investments. The Company&#146;s accounts receivable represent amounts due primarily from governmental
agencies. Accounts receivable due from the Alabama Department of Corrections and the New York
City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene represent approximately 14% and 10%, respectively, of
accounts receivable less allowances at December&nbsp;31, 2004. Deposits on professional liability and
other insurance programs represent amounts paid by the Company that are subject to future refund
from the insurance company which provides the coverage. Currently, these balances are carried by
American International Group for workers compensation and Lexington Insurance Company, a
subsidiary of American International Group, for professional liability. The Company&#146;s financial
instruments are subject to the possibility of loss in carrying value as a result of either the
failure of other parties to perform according to their contractual obligations or changes in
market prices that make the instruments less valuable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantially all of the Company&#146;s revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 relates to
amounts earned under contracts with state and local governments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 5.1% of the Company&#146;s workforce is represented by labor unions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Other Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.&nbsp;46R, <I>Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities</I>, or FIN No.&nbsp;46. This interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of
variable interest entities when certain characteristics are present. The Company adopted the
provisions of FIN No.&nbsp;46 effective January&nbsp;1, 2004. Such adoption did not impact the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Reclassifications</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to current period
presentation.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;30, 2004, EMSA Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the Company, which was acquired
in January&nbsp;1999, entered into a settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office,
related to allegations, first raised in connection with an investigation of EMSA Correctional
Services (&#147;EMSA&#148;) in 1997, that the Company may have played an indirect role in the improper
billing of Medicaid by independent providers treating incarcerated patients.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office constitutes a complete
resolution and settlement of the claims asserted against EMSA and required EMSA Limited Partnership
to pay $5.0&nbsp;million to the State of Florida. This payment was made by the Company on March&nbsp;30,
2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company and all of its subsidiaries are
released from liability for any alleged actions which might have occurred from December&nbsp;1, 1998 to
March&nbsp;31, 2004. Both parties entered into the settlement agreement to avoid the delay,
uncertainty, inconvenience and expense of protracted litigation. The settlement agreement states
that it is not punitive in purpose or effect, it should not be construed or used as admission of
any fault, wrongdoing or liability whatsoever, and that EMSA specifically denies intentionally
submitting any medical claims in violation of state or federal law.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recorded a charge of $5.2&nbsp;million in its results of operations for the first
quarter of 2004, reflecting the settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office and
related legal expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>4. Reserve for Loss Contracts</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has
been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company performs this
loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as future
contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs, projected future stop-loss
insurance recoveries and each contract&#146;s specific terms related to future revenue increases as
compared to increased healthcare costs. The projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are
estimated based on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost increases. These
estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims experience as previously
noted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a contract loss reserve for succeeding
periods. As a result of its fourth quarter 2001 review, the Company identified five non-cancelable
contracts that, based upon management&#146;s projections, were expected to continue to incur negative
gross margins over their remaining terms. In December&nbsp;2001, the Company recorded a charge of $18.3
million to establish a reserve for future losses under these non-cancelable contracts. The five
contracts covered by the charge had expiration dates ranging from June&nbsp;30, 2002 through June&nbsp;30,
2005. Ninety percent of the charge related to the State of Kansas Department of Corrections (the
&#147;Kansas DOC&#148;) contract, which was to expire on June&nbsp;30, 2005, and the City of Philadelphia
contract, which was renewable annually, at the client&#146;s option, through June&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2002, the Company and the City of Philadelphia reached a mutual agreement that the
contract between PHS and the City of Philadelphia would expire effective June&nbsp;30, 2002. As a
result of the earlier than anticipated expiration of this loss contract, the Company recorded a
gain of $3.3&nbsp;million, in the second quarter of 2002, to reduce its reserve for loss contracts.
From July&nbsp;1, 2002 to September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company provided services to the City of Philadelphia
under a transition arrangement. Subsequent to September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company is continuing to
provide healthcare services to the City of Philadelphia under modified contract terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, the Company utilized its loss contract reserve at a
rate greater than previously anticipated due to an unexpected increase in healthcare expenses
associated with the Company&#146;s contract to provide services to the Kansas DOC. The primary causes
for the increase in healthcare expenses in this contract were hospitalization and outpatient costs.
The Company increased its reserve for loss contracts by $4.5&nbsp;million, as of June&nbsp;30, 2003, to
cover estimated future losses under the Kansas DOC contract, which was to expire in June&nbsp;2005.
This increase in the reserve for loss contracts is reflected as a component of income from
discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second and third quarters of 2003, the Company participated in active discussions
with the Kansas DOC related to a proposal from the Company that would significantly reduce the
remaining length of the current contract. In response to the proposal, the Kansas DOC solicited
and received proposals from several other vendors to provide healthcare services to the Kansas DOC.
After the Kansas DOC&#146;s evaluation of the proposals from the other vendors, in August&nbsp;2003, the
Company began discussions with Health Cost Solutions, Inc. (&#147;HCS&#148;) and the Kansas DOC related to a
proposal pursuant to which HCS would assume the Company&#146;s performance obligation under the Kansas
DOC contract.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company entered into an assignment and novation agreement with the
Kansas DOC to assign the Kansas DOC contract to HCS effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. The Company also
entered into a general assignment, novation and assumption agreement with HCS to transfer the
Kansas DOC contract to HCS, effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. Beginning October&nbsp;1, 2003, HCS became
solely responsible for the performance of the Kansas DOC contract, and the Company has no
obligation to the Kansas DOC or to HCS related to HCS&#146; performance of the contract, therefore the
operating results of this contract have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all
periods presented. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s agreement with HCS, the Company agreed to pay
HCS net consideration of $5.6&nbsp;million in 21&nbsp;monthly installments, which commenced October&nbsp;31, 2003
and will continue through June&nbsp;30, 2005. As a result of the financial terms of the Company&#146;s
agreement with HCS, in the third quarter of 2003, the Company reclassified $6.5&nbsp;million of its
reserve for loss contracts to accounts payable and recorded a gain of $1.7&nbsp;million, to reduce its
reserve for loss contracts. This decrease in the reserve for loss contracts is reflected as a
component of income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated
statements of operations.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contract with the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services
(&#147;Maryland DPS&#148;) has historically underperformed, fluctuating between minimal profitability,
breakeven and losses. This contract was entered into on July&nbsp;1, 2000, to provide comprehensive
medical services to four regions of the Maryland prison system. The initial term of the contract
was for the three years ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, with the Maryland DPS having the ability to renew the
contract for two additional one-year terms. The contract is presently in its second renewal term
and is non-cancelable by the Company. The Maryland DPS pays the Company a flat fee per month with
certain limited cost-sharing adjustments for staffing costs, primarily for nurses, and the cost of
medications related to certain specific illnesses. The Company is fully at risk for increases in
hospitalization and outpatient costs under the terms of the contract with the Maryland DPS. The
contract also contains provisions that allow the Maryland DPS to assess penalties if certain
staffing or performance criteria are not maintained. The flat fee paid to the Company is increased
annually based on a portion of the consumer price index.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the flat fee nature of this contract, the Company&#146;s margin under the contract can be
significantly impacted by changes in healthcare costs, utilization trends or inmate population.
The Company incurred losses under this contract in April&nbsp;2004 at a level slightly above
expectations. The losses under the contract increased significantly in May&nbsp;2004 to approximately
$1.1&nbsp;million for the month. The primary cause for the increased loss was an unanticipated increase
in hospitalization costs beginning in May, resulting from the volume and acuity of services being
provided, the number of HIV and mental health patients and the costs associated with current
treatment guidelines. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss
contract charge of $6.8&nbsp;million, effective June&nbsp;1, 2004, which represented its &#147;most likely&#148;
estimate, at that date, of the future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland
DPS contract through its expiration on June&nbsp;30, 2005. This estimate assumed monthly losses under
the contract would diminish from the May&nbsp;2004 level, which was viewed as an aberration, to
approximately $523,000 per month, including allocated overhead, an amount significantly above
recent historical levels.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2004, the Company utilized $2.6&nbsp;million of its loss contract
reserve, almost entirely due to the underperformance of the Maryland DPS contract. While actual
monthly losses incurred under the Maryland DPS contract had trended downward from the record loss
in May, losses once again increased in September, driven primarily by off-site medical costs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off-site medical costs under the Maryland DPS contract averaged $1.3&nbsp;million per month for
June through September&nbsp;2004, as compared with initial estimates of $974,000 per month, based on
historical results. As a result of this new and more severe trend, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $6.0&nbsp;million, effective September&nbsp;30, 2004, to increase its reserve for estimated future
losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland DPS contract until its expiration in
June&nbsp;2005. A fundamental assumption of the $6.0&nbsp;million increase in loss reserve was that the
contract would continue to incur on average $1.4&nbsp;million per month of off-site medical costs
through its termination on June&nbsp;30, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the further quarter, the Company utilized $3.4&nbsp;million of its loss contract reserve,
which relates to the Maryland DPS and a county contract. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had
a loss contract reserve totaling $6.1&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might revise its
estimate of future losses related to the contracts currently identified as loss contacts. It might
also identify additional contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in
circumstances. Circumstances that might change and result in a revised estimate of future losses
or the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period include unanticipated
adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the utilization of outside
medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues.
Should the Company identify circumstances that would result in a revision of its estimate of
future losses for a loss contract, the Company would, in the period in which the revision is made,
increase or decrease the reserve for loss contracts. Should a contract be identified as a loss
contract in a future period, the Company would record, in the period in which such identification
is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that would be incurred under the contract. A
revision to a current loss contract or the identification of a loss contract in the future could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which the
reserve is recorded.

or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;), each of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare
services contracts is a component of an entity, whose operations can be distinguished from the rest

expiration or otherwise, the contract&#146;s operations generally will be eliminated from the ongoing

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>13. Banking Arrangements</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company entered into a new credit facility with CapitalSource Finance
LLC (the &#147;CapitalSource Credit Facility&#148;). The CapitalSource Credit Facility matures on October
31, 2005 and includes a $55.0&nbsp;million revolving credit facility (the &#147;Revolver&#148;) and prior to the
third quarter of 2004 also included a $5.0&nbsp;million term loan (the &#147;Term Loan&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2003, the Company and CapitalSource Finance LLC entered into an amendment to the
CapitalSource Credit Facility. Under the terms of the amendment, the Company may have standby
letters of credit issued under the loan agreement in amounts up to $10.0&nbsp;million. The amount
available to the Company for borrowings under the CapitalSource Credit Facility is reduced by the
amount of each outstanding standby letter of credit. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had
outstanding standby letters of credit totaling $4.0&nbsp;million, which were used to collateralize
performance bonds.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and
its operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under
the Revolver and $45.6&nbsp;million available for additional borrowing, based on the Company&#146;s
collateral base on that date and outstanding standby letters of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Revolver are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of eligible receivables (as
defined in the Revolver) or (2) $55.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;Revolver Capacity&#148;). Interest under the
Revolver is payable monthly at the greater of 5.75% or the Citibank N.A. prime rate plus 1.0%. The
Company is also required to pay a monthly collateral management fee, equal to an annual rate of
1.38%, on average borrowings outstanding under the Revolver. Additionally, the Company is required
to pay a monthly letter of credit fee equal to an annual rate of 3.5% on the outstanding balance of
letters of credit issued pursuant to the Revolver.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the CapitalSource Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a monthly
unused line fee equal to an annual rate of 0.6% on the Revolver Capacity less the actual average
borrowings outstanding under the Revolver for the month and the balance of any outstanding letters
of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2004, the Company prepaid the remaining balance of $2.1&nbsp;million
and retired its Term Loan which was set to mature on October&nbsp;31, 2005. In conjunction with the
retirement of the Term Loan, the Company paid a $0.1&nbsp;million loan fee which was due upon maturity.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants
related to minimum levels of earnings. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with
these covenants. The CapitalSource Credit Facility also contains restrictions on the Company with
respect to certain types of transactions including acquisition of the Company&#146;s own stock, payment
of dividends, indebtedness and sales or transfers of assets.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical financial results, projected future taxable income and the
expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the
Company to record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; It further states &#147;forming a conclusion that a
valuation allowance is not needed is

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.&#148; Since
December&nbsp;31, 2001 and until June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company maintained a 100% valuation allowance equal
to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets that can be realized through
offsets to existing taxable temporary differences.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the Company&#146;s results of operations since December&nbsp;31, 2001, and its expected
profitability in this and future years, the Company concluded, effective June&nbsp;30, 2004, that it is
more likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets will be realized. As a
result, in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to
such net deferred tax assets was reversed in the second quarter of 2004. Reversal of the valuation
allowance resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2004 totaling $5.3
million. This benefit represented the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax assets,
excluding those deferred tax assets that resulted from the exercise of employee stock options. The
reversal of the valuation allowance that related to the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax
assets resulting from the exercises of employee stock options totaled $3.9&nbsp;million and was recorded
as a direct increase to additional paid-in capital in the stockholders&#146; equity portion of the
Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company&#146;s
valuation allowance of approximately $175,000 represents management&#146;s estimate of state net
operating loss carryforwards which will expire unused.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in the third quarter of 2004, the Company began providing for an income tax
provision at the estimated combined federal and state effective tax rates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
$15.7&nbsp;million and $46.4&nbsp;million, respectively, which expire at various dates from 2016 through
2022. Included in current deferred tax assets at December&nbsp;31, 2004 are federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards that management estimates will be utilized in 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate, related to
income (loss)&nbsp;from continuing operations, is as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had tax contingency reserves totaling approximately
$475,000 which are included in accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>15. Capital Structure</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;21, 2002, the Company completed a private placement of 720,000 shares of newly
issued common stock at $6.33 per share, realizing proceeds of approximately $4.0&nbsp;million, net of
issuance costs. The net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under the Company&#146;s prior credit
facility. The Company registered the resale of all of the shares on a Form S-3 registration
statement (No.&nbsp;333-98355), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August&nbsp;19, 2002
and declared effective on October&nbsp;18, 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;16, 2004, stockholders of the Company authorized a proposal to amend the Company&#146;s
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock
it is authorized to issue from 15,000,000 shares to 30,000,000. Currently, the Company has
2,000,000 authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;16, 2004, the Company issued 7,500 shares of restricted stock to its Board of
Directors.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>16. Stock Option Plans</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has an Incentive Stock Plan (the &#147;Incentive Plan&#148;) which provides for the
granting of options, stock awards and stock appreciation rights to officers, key employees and
non-employee directors for up to 2,224,500 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. Awards and
vesting periods under the plan are discretionary and are administered by a committee of the Board
of Directors. The exercise price of the options cannot be less than the fair market value of the
Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant. Options and other benefits expire at such times as
the committee determines at the time of grant, but no later than ten years from the grant date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;30, 1999, stockholders of the Company approved the America Service Group Inc. 1999
Incentive Stock Plan (the &#147;1999 Plan&#148;) to allow for the issuance of stock options, restricted
stock, stock appreciation rights and for the purchase of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock and
the extension of recourse loans to certain of the Company&#146;s key employees and outside directors to
permit them to purchase such shares of common stock. Effective June&nbsp;16, 2004, stockholders of the
Company approved the America Service Group Inc. Amended and Restated 1999 Incentive Stock Plan
(the &#147;Amended Plan&#148;) to attract and retain eligible employees and outside directors of the
Company, to provide an incentive to eligible employees and outside directors to work to increase
the value of the Company&#146;s common stock and to provide eligible employees and outside directors
with a stake in the future of the Company which corresponds to the stake of each stockholder.
There are 2,439,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock available under the Amended Plan, which
include 1,179,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock authorized for issuance under the 1999
Plan. Accordingly, during 2004, the number of shares authorized for issuance increased by
1,260,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. No shares remain available under the 1999 Plan.
The exercise price of the options cannot be less than the fair market value of the Company&#146;s
common stock at the date of grant. Options and other benefits expire at such times as the
committee determines at the time of grant, but no later than ten years from the grant date.
Additionally, the Amended Plan does not permit loans to eligible employees and outside directors
for the purchase of common stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Incentive Plan and the Amended Plan, the Company has also granted options
to certain members of executive management to purchase 352,500 shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock (the &#147;Executive Plans&#148;). The exercise price of these options equaled the fair market value
of the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant. The options expire ten years from the date of
grant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following summary presents combined stock option activity under all of the above plans
for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2004:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above share and per share information reflects the Company&#146;s stock split authorized
on September&nbsp;24, 2004. See Note 6 for further information.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>17. Stockholders&#146; Notes Receivable</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the 1999 Plan, prior to July&nbsp;29, 2002, the Company was allowed to extend recourse loans
to certain of its key employees and outside directors to permit them to purchase shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock. No loans were issued in 2002, 2003 or 2004 and no future loans will be
issued. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, all outstanding loans were paid in full. Effective June&nbsp;16,
2004, the Amended Plan does not permit loans to eligible employees and outside directors for the
purchase of common stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>18. Net Income Per Share</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net income per share is measured at two levels: basic income per share and diluted income per
share. Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding after considering the additional
dilution related to other dilutive securities. The Company&#146;s other dilutive securities outstanding
consist of options to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. The table below sets forth
the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share as required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;128, <I>Earnings Per Share </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;128&#148;)<I>, </I>for the three years in the
period ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 (dollars in thousands except per share amounts).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above share and per share information reflects the Company&#146;s stock split authorized
on September&nbsp;24, 2004. See Note 6 for further information.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>19. Other Employee Benefit Plans</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) covering substantially all
employees who have completed one year and 1,000 hours of service. The Plan permits eligible
employees to defer and contribute to the Plan a portion of their compensation. The Company may, at
the Board&#146;s discretion, match such employee contributions to the Plan ranging from 1% to 3% of
eligible compensation, depending on the employee&#146;s years of participation. The Company made no
matching contributions in 2004, 2003 or 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company instituted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 1996. The Employee Stock
Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to elect to purchase shares of common stock through
voluntary automatic payroll deductions of up to 10% of the employee&#146;s annual salary. Purchases of
stock under the plan are made at the end of two six-month offering periods each year, one
beginning on January 1 and one beginning on July 1. At the end of each six-month period, the
employee&#146;s contributions during that six-month period are used to purchase shares of common stock
from the Company at 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of
that six-month period, whichever is lower. The employee may elect to discontinue participation in
the plan at any time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>20. Professional and General Liability Self-insurance Retention</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records a liability for reported and unreported professional and general
liability claims. Amounts accrued were $18.7&nbsp;million and $18.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and non-current portion of accrued
expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from the
continuous review process and differences between estimates and loss payments are recognized in
the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made. Reserves for professional and
general liability exposures are subject to fluctuations in frequency and severity. Given the
inherent degree of variability in any such estimates, the reserves reported at December&nbsp;31, 2004
represent management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts necessary to discharge the Company&#146;s
obligations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>21. Commitments and Contingencies</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Operating Leases</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company leases office space and equipment under certain noncancelable operating leases.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future minimum annual lease payments at December&nbsp;31, 2004 are as follows (in thousands):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rental expense under operating leases was $2.6&nbsp;million, $2.6&nbsp;million and $2.2&nbsp;million
for the years ended December&nbsp;2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Catastrophic Limits</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for
all treatment costs or, in some cases, only treatment costs related to certain catastrophic
events, and/or for AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses. Certain contracts do not contain such limits.
The Company attempts to compensate for the increased financial risk when pricing contracts that do
not contain individual, catastrophic or specific disease diagnosis-related limits. However, the
occurrence of severe individual cases, AIDS-related illnesses or a catastrophic event in a
facility governed by a contract without such limitations could render the contract unprofitable
and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations. For contracts that do not
contain catastrophic protection, the Company maintains insurance from an unaffiliated insurer for
annual hospitalization amounts in excess of $500,000 per inmate up to an annual cap of $1.0
million per inmate and a lifetime cap of $2.0&nbsp;million per inmate. The Company believes this
insurance helps mitigate its exposure to individually material expenses of catastrophic
hospitalization. Catastrophic insurance premiums and recoveries, neither of which is significant,
are included in healthcare expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Litigation and Claims</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>EMSA lease matter. </I>On July&nbsp;12, 2004, EMSA Limited Partnership, a limited partnership owned by
the Company, received an unexpected adverse jury verdict in the Circuit Court, 11<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP>
Judicial Circuit, Miami-Dade County, Florida of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million plus potential interest
which has the potential to double the amount of the award to $2.5&nbsp;million. This verdict relates to
a 12&nbsp;year old case filed by the plaintiff, Community Health Related Services, Inc. (wholly owned by
Dr.&nbsp;Carlos Vicaria) seeking unspecified damages involving a lease dispute in connection with a line
of business managing physician clinics operated by EMSA Limited Partnership prior to its
acquisition by the Company in 1999. The Company did not acquire this line of business or assume
the expired sublease from the seller under the transaction. The Company has, to date, been forced
to defend the case as the seller has not yet assumed responsibility. The trial judge has yet to
enter the jury&#146;s verdict as a final judgment and the Company has filed a motion for new trial, a
motion for remittitur or new trial as to damages, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict, and for judgment in accordance with its previous motion for a directed verdict. The
matter currently remains under advisement with the court and the Company will continue to
vigorously defend the lawsuit and believes that it will ultimately be successful, through either
its post-trial motions or on appeal, in having the verdict award reduced or overturned. However,
in the event the Company is not successful at the trial court level or on appeal, or if the Company
decides not to appeal an unfavorable verdict, an adverse judgment could have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company, after giving consideration to its post-trial motions and appeal
rights, estimates that its probable loss related to this matter will be significantly below the
$1.2&nbsp;million jury verdict amount. The Company&#146;s reserves related to this matter are included in
its reserves for all general legal matters, which total approximately $900,000 as of December&nbsp;31,
2004. In addition to its rights under post-verdict motions and the potential for appeal, the
Company has filed suit against Caremark RX, Inc. (&#147;Caremark&#148;), the successor to the party who sold
EMSA to the Company, for indemnification for all costs associated with this case as well as any
judgment returned which is adverse to the Company. Caremark is defending this lawsuit and the
Company does not know whether it will prevail against Caremark. Accordingly, such reimbursement
has not been reflected in the Company&#146;s reserve estimate discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Polk County matter. </I>During 2003, the Company was successful on its appeal of a previous
summary judgment granted against it in January&nbsp;2002 on an indemnification claim by the insurer of a
client. The case has now been remanded to the lower court in accordance with the appellate court&#146;s
opinion as discussed below. In December&nbsp;1995, the Florida Association of Counties Trust (&#147;FACT&#148;),
as the insurer for the Polk County Sheriff&#146;s Office, and the Sheriff of Polk County, Florida, (the
&#147;Sheriff&#146;s Office&#148;) brought an action against the
Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, PHS, in the Circuit Court, 10th Judicial Circuit, Polk County, Florida seeking
indemnification for $1.0&nbsp;million allegedly paid on behalf of FACT for settlement of a lawsuit
brought against the Sheriff&#146;s Office. The recovery is sought for amounts paid in settlement of a
wrongful death claim brought by the estate of an inmate who died as a result of injuries sustained
from a beating from several corrections officers employed by the Sheriff&#146;s Office. In addition,
the Sheriff&#146;s Office released the Company from any liability for this claim subsequent to filing
the FACT lawsuit. The plaintiffs contend that an indemnification provision in the contract between
PHS and the Sheriff&#146;s Office obligates the Company to indemnify the Sheriff&#146;s Office against losses
caused by its own wrongful acts. The Company was represented by counsel provided by Reliance
Insurance Company (&#147;Reliance&#148;), the Company&#146;s insurer. In April&nbsp;2001, FACT&#146;s motion for summary
judgment on the question of liability for indemnity was denied,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">but on rehearing in July&nbsp;2001 the prior denial was reversed and summary judgment was granted.
In October&nbsp;2001, Reliance filed for receivership. In January&nbsp;2002, the court entered final
judgment in favor of FACT for approximately $1.7&nbsp;million at a hearing at which the Company was not
represented, as counsel provided by Reliance had simultaneously filed a motion to withdraw. The
Company retained new counsel in February&nbsp;2002 and obtained a reversal of the summary judgment
motion on October&nbsp;31, 2003. The case has been remanded to the trial court to determine if the
actions of the officers, for which some of them were indicted and convicted, were indemnifiable as
a matter of public policy and whether the claims for which indemnity was sought arose out of the
provision of medical services and not the actions of the officers. The parties agreed to submit
the matter to nonbinding arbitration and the Company received a successful ruling in July&nbsp;2004.
FACT has not moved to engage in discovery necessary for any trial. Should the matter go forward
to trial the Company believes it will ultimately be successful at the trial court level. However,
in the event the Company is not successful at the trial court level, an adverse judgment could have
a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results
of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company has no reserves associated with this
proceeding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other Matters. </I>In addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is a party to various
legal proceedings incidental to its business. Certain claims, suits and complaints arising in the
ordinary course of business have been filed or are pending against the Company. An estimate of the
amounts payable on existing claims for which the liability of the Company is probable is included
in accrued expenses at December&nbsp;31, 2004. The Company is not aware of any material unasserted
claims that would have a material adverse effect
on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Performance Bonds</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is required under certain contracts to provide performance bonds. At December
31, 2004, the Company has outstanding performance bonds totaling approximately $22.5&nbsp;million.
These performance bonds are collateralized by letters of credit totaling $4.0&nbsp;million (see Note
13).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>22. Related Party Transaction</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, the Company entered into a consulting arrangement with an entity affiliated with
a member of its board of directors. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company paid approximately
$0, $40,000 and $94,000, respectively, to this related entity.

from the ongoing operations of the Company and classified as discontinued operations.
Accordingly, the operations of such contracts, net of applicable income taxes, have been presented
as discontinued operations and prior period quarterly financial data has been reclassified.

first quarter of 2004 for final settlement of a Florida legal matter. See Note 4 for a discussion
of the pre-tax charges totaling $12.8&nbsp;million in the loss contract reserve recorded in the second
and third quarters of 2004. See Note 14 for a discussion of the income tax benefit of $5.3
million recorded in the second quarter of 2004 related to the reversal of substantially all of a
previously recorded valuation allowance. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company realized an
effective tax rate of 23% due to the recognition of an income tax benefit related to an increase
on the Company&#146;s previously estimated net operating loss carryforwards.
