(&#147;EMSA&#148;) and Correctional Health Services, LLC
(&#147;CHS&#148;), contracts to provide and/or administer managed
healthcare services to over 120 correctional facilities throughout the United States. Prior to May
1, 2007, the Company through its subsidiary Secure Pharmacy Plus, LLC
(&#147;SPP&#148;), was also a distributor of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. The Company
is a leading non-governmental provider and/or administrator of correctional healthcare services in
the United States.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;12, 2007, SPP and PHS, as guarantor, entered into an asset purchase agreement with
Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corporation (&#147;Maxor&#148;) whereby SPP agreed to sell certain of its
assets at net book value (the &#147;Transaction&#148;). The closing of the Transaction occurred on May&nbsp;3,
2007, with an effective date as of April&nbsp;30, 2007. The net book value of the assets included in
the Transaction was approximately $3.8&nbsp;million as of April&nbsp;30, 2007, which consisted of
approximately $1.9&nbsp;million in inventory and approximately $2.0&nbsp;million in fixed assets, offset by
approximately $0.1&nbsp;million of liabilities for accrued vacation assumed by Maxor. Additionally, as
a condition to the closing of the Transaction, Maxor and PHS entered into a long-term pharmacy
services agreement (the &#147;Services Agreement&#148;) pursuant to which Maxor became the provider of
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to PHS. The Services Agreement commenced effective May&nbsp;1,
2007 and will remain in effect until October&nbsp;31, 2014 (unless terminated earlier in accordance with
the terms of the Services Agreement). During the term of the Services Agreement, PHS will utilize
Maxor on an exclusive basis to provide pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical supplies to PHS,
except in certain specified situations, including when a PHS client elects or requires PHS to
utilize another pharmacy services provider.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;24, 2005, the Company announced that the Audit Committee had initiated an internal
investigation into certain matters related to SPP. As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company
announced that the Audit Committee had concluded its investigation and reached certain conclusions
with respect to findings of the investigation that resulted in an accrual of $3.7&nbsp;million of
aggregate refunds due to customers, including PHS, that were not charged by SPP in accordance with
the terms of the respective contracts. In circumstances where SPP&#146;s incorrect billings resulted in
PHS billing its clients incorrectly, PHS passed the applicable amount through to its clients. This
amount plus associated interest represented management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to
affected customers, based on the results of the Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. As of December
31, 2008, the Company has paid all of the accrued funds for this matter plus associated interest to
customers except for $0.4&nbsp;million which has been tendered for payment to the appropriate customers.
The ultimate amounts refunded could differ from the Company&#146;s estimates; however, actual refund
amounts to date have not differed materially from the estimated amounts. There can be no assurance
that the Company, a customer or a third-party, including a governmental entity, will not assert
that additional amounts, which may include penalties, are owed to these customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Correctional Healthcare Services</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, through PHS and CHS, contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies
to provide and/or administer healthcare services to inmates of prisons and jails. The Company&#146;s
revenues from correctional healthcare services are generated primarily by payments from
governmental entities, none of which are dependent on third party payment sources although they are
dependent on appropriate governmental funding. The Company provides and/or administers a wide
range of on-site healthcare programs, and arranges for and oversees off-site hospitalization and
specialty outpatient care. The hospitalization and specialty outpatient care is performed by third
parties through arrangements with independent doctors and local hospitals. For the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, revenues from correctional healthcare services accounted for
100%, 99.4% and 97.4%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s healthcare revenues from continuing
operations and discontinued operations combined. Required financial information related to this
business segment is set forth in Note 24 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s target correctional market consists of state prison systems and county and local
jails. A prison is a facility in which an inmate is incarcerated for an extended period of time
(typically one year or longer). A jail is a facility in which the inmate is held for a shorter
period of time, often while awaiting trial or sentencing. The expected higher inmate turnover in
jails typically requires that healthcare be provided to a much larger number of individual inmates
over time and includes the costs associated with stabilizing and treating whatever health
conditions or injuries are present at the time of initial incarceration. As a result of the higher
number of individual inmate patient encounters and the greater likelihood of previously undiagnosed
acute healthcare needs associated with healthcare in jail settings, the severity and therefore
related costs of treating such patients, particularly with respect to professional liability costs,
are typically greater in jails as opposed to prison systems. Conversely, the costs of chronic
healthcare requirements are generally greater with respect to state prison contracts. State prison
contracts often cover a larger number of facilities and often have longer terms than jail
contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Services Provided and/or Administered. </I>Although the precise type of services to be provided
and/or administered by the Company vary depending on the specific terms of a contract, generally,
the Company&#146;s obligation to provide and/or administer medical services to a particular inmate
begins upon the inmate&#146;s booking into the correctional facility and ends upon the inmate&#146;s release.
In order to reduce costs and provide better care, emphasis is placed upon early identification of
serious injuries or illnesses so that prompt and clinically-effective treatment is commenced.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided and/or administered on-site may include physical and mental health
screening upon intake. Screening includes the compilation of the inmate&#146;s health history and the
identification of any current, chronic or acute healthcare needs. After initial screening,
services provided and/or administered may include regular physical and dental screening and care,
psychiatric care, OB-GYN screening and care and diagnostic testing. Hospitalization is provided
off-site at acute-care hospitals. Sick call is regularly conducted and physicians, nurse
practitioners, physicians&#146; assistants and others are also involved in the delivery of care on a
regular basis. Necessary medications are administered by clinical staff.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided and/or administered off-site may include specialty outpatient
diagnostic testing and care, emergency room care, surgery and hospitalization. This care is
performed by third parties through arrangements with independent doctors and local hospitals. In
addition, the Company provides administrative support services on-site, at regional offices and at
the Company&#146;s headquarters. Administrative support services may include program management,
maintenance of on-site medical records and employee recruitment, scheduling, continuing education
and quality assurance, medical audits, credentialing, and clinical program development activities.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Company&#146;s correctional contracts require it to staff the facilities it serves with
nurses 24 hours a day. Doctors at the facilities have regular hours and are generally available on
call. In addition, dentists, psychiatrists and other specialists are available on a routine basis
at facilities where correctional contracts cover such services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (&#147;NCCHC&#148;) and the American Correctional
Association (&#147;ACA&#148;) set standards for and offer accreditation to facilities that meet their
respective standards. These standards provide specific guidance related to a service provider&#146;s
operations including administration, personnel, support services such as hospital care, regular
services such as sick call, records management and medical and legal issues. Accreditation with
NCCHC and ACA standards is voluntary and includes many other aspects of the operation of the
correctional facility other than the healthcare component. As such, not all of the Company&#146;s
clients seek this accreditation. For those clients that do request the Company to seek such
accreditation, the Company believes it has a 100% success rate of obtaining and maintaining
accreditation with these organizations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCCHC, an independent not-for-profit organization initially formed by the American Medical
Association, was established to improve the quality of health care in jails, prisons, and juvenile
confinement facilities. NCCHC offers a voluntary health services accreditation program through
external peer review to determine whether correctional institutions meet certain standards in their
provision of health services. NCCHC renders a professional judgment and assists in the improvement
of services provided and/or administered. The ACA, an independent not-for-profit organization, was
established to develop uniformity and industry standards for the operation of correctional
facilities and the provision of inmate healthcare. Accreditation involves an extensive audit and
compliance procedure, and is generally granted for a three-year period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contract Provisions. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions typically fall
into one of three general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee. For fixed
fee contracts, the Company&#146;s revenues are based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service
contract irrespective of inmate population. The Company&#146;s revenues for population-based contracts
are based either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for variances
in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or on a per diem rate multiplied by
the average or actual inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee contracts,
the Company&#146;s revenues are based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a
contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed fee or per diem based upon the
regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts that extend
beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of the Company&#146;s
costs of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. The Company often
bears the risk of increased or unexpected costs, which could result in reduced profits or cause it
to sustain losses when costs are higher than projected. Conversely, the Company will derive
increased profits when costs are lower than projected. Certain contracts also contain financial
penalties when performance and/or staffing criteria are not achieved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
the Company&#146;s contracts will also include additional provisions
that mitigate a
portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in
the majority of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses,
stop-loss provisions, cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of
certain or all off-site service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of
the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically, under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue
under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site
expenses or pharmaceutical costs. While such provisions serve to mitigate the Company&#146;s exposure
to losses resulting from cost fluctuations in the specified cost categories, the Company will still
experience variances in its gross margin percentage on these contracts as the additional revenue
under these contract provisions is typically equal to the additional costs incurred by the Company.
Many contracts contain termination provisions which allow either party to terminate the
contract under agreed-upon notice periods. The ability to terminate a contract serves to mitigate
the Company&#146;s risk related to increasing costs of services being provided.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts accounting for approximately 8.8% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services
revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 contain no limits on the
Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to off-site expenses, catastrophic illnesses or
injuries to inmates. However, none of these contracts has longer than one year remaining without a
termination provision.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when preparing bid proposals, the Company estimates the extent of its exposure to
cost increases, severe individual cases and catastrophic events and attempts to compensate for its
exposure in the pricing of its bids. The Company&#146;s management has experience in evaluating these
risks for bidding purposes and maintains an extensive database of historical experience.
Nonetheless, increased or unexpected costs against which the Company is not protected could render
a contract unprofitable. Furthermore, in an effort to manage risk under contracts that contain no
limits on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to off-site expenses, catastrophic
illnesses or injuries to inmates, the Company typically maintains stop loss insurance from an
unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital
expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual
and a lifetime cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate. Amounts reimbursable per claim under the policy are
further

forecasting purposes. These systems also enable the Company to refine its bids and help the
Company reduce the costs associated with the delivery of consistent healthcare.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a utilization review system to monitor the extent and duration of most
healthcare services required by inmates on an inpatient and outpatient basis. The current
automated utilization review program is an integral part of the services provided and/or
administered at each facility. The system is designed to ensure that the medical care rendered is
medically necessary and is provided safely in a clinically appropriate setting while maintaining
traditional standards of quality of care. The system provides for determinations of medical
necessity by medical professionals through a process of pre-authorization and concurrent review of
the appropriateness of any hospital stay. The system seeks to identify the maximum capability of
on-site healthcare units to allow for a more timely discharge from the hospital back to the
correctional facility. The utilization review staff consists of doctors and nurses who are
supported by medical directors at the regional and corporate levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed a variety of customized databases to facilitate and improve
operational review including (i)&nbsp;a claims management tracking system that monitors current
outpatient charges and inpatient stays, (ii)&nbsp;a comprehensive cost review system that analyzes the
Company&#146;s average costs per inmate at each facility, which includes pharmaceutical utilization and
trend analysis available from Maxor, and (iii)&nbsp;a daily operating report to manage off-site
utilization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bid Process. </I>Contracts with governmental agencies are obtained primarily through a
competitive bidding process, which is governed by applicable state and local statutes and
ordinances. Although practices vary, typically a formal request for proposal (&#147;RFP&#148;), or similar
request or invitation, is issued by the governmental agency, stating the scope of work to be
performed, length of contract, performance bonding requirements, minimum qualifications of bidders,
selection criteria and the format to be followed in the bid or proposal. Usually, a committee
appointed by the governmental agency reviews bids and makes an award determination. The committee
may award the contract to a particular bidder or decide not to award
the contract. Typically, the committee
considers a number of factors, including the technical quality of the proposal, the bid price and
the reputation of the bidder for providing quality care. The award of a contract may be subject to
formal or informal protest by unsuccessful bidders through a governmental appeals process. If the
committee does not award a contract, the correctional agency may, among various options, continue
to provide healthcare services to its inmates with its own personnel or the existing provider.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contractual and Regulatory Compliance. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with governmental agencies
often require it to comply with numerous additional requirements regarding record-keeping and
accounting, non-discrimination in the hiring of personnel, safety, safeguarding confidential
information, management qualifications, professional licensing requirements, emergency healthcare
needs of corrections employees and other matters. If a violation of the terms of an applicable
contractual or statutory provision occurs, a contractor may be debarred or suspended from obtaining
future contracts for specified periods of time in the applicable location. The Company has never
been debarred or suspended from seeking procurements in any jurisdiction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Marketing. </I>The Company gathers, monitors and analyzes relevant information on potential jail
and prison systems which meet predefined new business criteria. These criteria include facility
size, location, revenue and margin potential and exposure to risk. The Company then devotes the
necessary resources in securing new business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes it is one of the largest private providers of healthcare services to
county/municipal jails and detention centers in the United States. The Company will continue to
focus its business development efforts on those facilities where stabilization and treatment of the
population is the primary mission. The Company will also continue to pursue certain opportunities
at state prison systems, where in many cases, services are provided to a larger system with a more
permanent population. Due to the more permanent population at the state prison facilities, the
primary healthcare mission shifts to disease management and treatment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a staff of sales and marketing representatives assigned to specific
projects, geographic areas or markets. In addition, the Company uses consultants, from time to
time, to help identify marketing opportunities, to determine the needs of specific potential
customers and to engage customers and others on the Company&#146;s behalf. The Company uses paid
advertising and promotion to reach prospective clients as well as to reinforce its image with
existing clients.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to May&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company, through SPP, contracted with federal, state and local
governments and certain private entities (including PHS) to distribute pharmaceuticals and certain
medical supplies to inmates of correctional facilities. However, as discussed above in Item&nbsp;1.
&#147;General &#151; Business,&#148; SPP sold certain of its assets to Maxor effective April&nbsp;30, 2007 which ended

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services provided and/or administered by the Company require an experienced staff of
healthcare professionals and facilities administrators. In particular, a nursing staff with
experience in correctional healthcare and specialized skills in all necessary areas contributes
significantly to the Company&#146;s ability to provide efficient service. In addition to nurses, the
Company&#146;s staff of employees and independent contractors includes physicians, dentists,
psychologists and other healthcare professionals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company had approximately 3,877 employees, including
approximately 354 doctors and 1,915 nurses. The Company also utilizes approximately 935 independent

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental entities is highly
fragmented and competitive with few barriers to entry. The Company is in direct competition with
local, regional and national correctional healthcare providers including certain state medical
schools and other state or municipal organizations. The Company estimates that it currently has
approximately 6.6% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on its estimates of
national aggregate annual expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its primary
competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates currently has
approximately 7.1% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, and Wexford Health
Sources, Inc., which the Company estimates currently has approximately 2.2% of such market. The
market share estimates shown above for the Company reflect its contracts currently in place,
including the recently awarded contract to provide prisoner health care services to prisoners under
the care of the State of Michigan Department of Corrections beginning on April&nbsp;1, 2009. The market
share estimates shown above for Correctional Medical Services and Wexford Health Sources, Inc.,
reflect the Company&#146;s estimate of contracts currently held by these competitors and, for
Correctional Medical Services reflect the recent loss of the contract to provide prisoner health
care services to prisoners under the care of the State of Michigan Department of Corrections. For
further information related to the State of Michigan Department of Corrections contract award, see
the section titled &#147;Major Contracts&#148; below. As the private market for providing correctional
healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s competitors may gain additional experience in bidding and
administering correctional healthcare contracts. In addition, new competitors, some of whom may
have extensive experience in related fields or greater financial resources than the Company, may
enter the market.

subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations and/or orders of judicial authorities,
including healthcare, pharmaceutical and safety regulations and judicial orders, decrees and
judgments. Some of the regulations and orders are unique to the Company&#146;s industry, and the
combination of regulations and orders it faces is unique. Generally, prospective providers of
healthcare services to correctional facilities must be able to comply with a variety of applicable
state and local regulations and judicial orders. The Company&#146;s contracts typically include
reporting requirements as well as, supervision and on-site monitoring by representatives of the
contracting governmental agencies or courts. In addition, the Company&#146;s doctors, nurses and other
healthcare professionals who provide services on its behalf are in most cases required to obtain
and maintain professional licenses and are subject to state regulation regarding professional
standards of conduct. The Company&#146;s services are also subject to operational and financial audits
by the governmental agencies with which the Company has contracts and by the courts of competent
jurisdiction. The Company may not always successfully comply with these regulations or court
orders and failure to comply can result in material penalties, or non-renewal or termination of
contracts with correctional facilities, or prohibition from proposing for new business in certain
jurisdictions.

county and local governmental entities. The Company&#146;s Rikers Island, New York contract accounted
for approximately 23.1% of the total healthcare revenues from continuing and discontinued
operations combined for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The Company&#146;s Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections contract accounted for approximately 15.5% of the total

initial three-year term, the Michigan Contract may be renewed for up to four additional one-year
periods by mutual, written agreement of the parties not less than 30&nbsp;days before the expiration of
the then current term. Under the terms of the Michigan Contract, the State of Michigan may
terminate the Michigan Contract for cause if PHS (i)&nbsp;breaches any of its material duties or
obligations under the Michigan Contract, or (ii)&nbsp;fails to cure a breach within the time period
specified in the written notice of breach provided by the State of Michigan. In addition, the

services under the Michigan Contract. The Company expects that revenues derived from the Michigan
Contract may exceed 10% of healthcare revenues from continuing and discontinued operations combined
for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2009. The loss of any of these contracts could have a material
adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For

make payments could adversely affect its results of operations or cash flows. </I>The Company&#146;s cash
flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of, and timely payment by, the governmental
entities with which it contracts. Economic circumstances at the national, state or local level
could affect governmental entity budgets, which could result in insufficient funding, increased
pricing pressure or termination of contracts. In addition, federal, state and local governments
are constantly under pressure to control additional spending or reduce current levels of spending.
Accordingly, if a governmental entity does not receive sufficient or timely funding to cover its
obligations under a healthcare services contract, the contract may be terminated and payment for
the Company&#146;s services could be delayed or not occur. The termination of contracts, a significant
delay in payment or non-payment could adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows.

healthcare services and it can provide no assurances that such further privatization will occur.</I>
The Company&#146;s future revenue growth depends, in part, on continued privatization by state, county
and local governmental agencies of healthcare services for correctional facilities. The Company
believes, based on marketplace information and internal estimates that approximately $20&nbsp;million to
$30&nbsp;million in annualized correctional healthcare contract revenues were newly privatized in 2008
by governmental agencies either for the first time or as a result of the expansion of existing
contracted services to encompass additional or expanded services. There can be no assurance that
this market will continue to grow at historical rates or at all, or that existing contracts will
continue to be made available to the private sector. Revenue growth could also be adversely
affected by material decreases in the inmate population of correctional facilities. Any of these
results could cause the Company&#146;s revenue to decline and harm its business and operating results.

Company, or specific alleged actions or inactions of the Company could adversely affect the
Company&#146;s results of operations or business. Privatization of healthcare services for correctional
facilities may encounter resistance from groups or constituencies that believe that healthcare
services to correctional facilities should only be provided by governmental agencies. Negative
publicity regarding the privatization of correctional healthcare services or specific alleged
actions or inactions of the Company or other industry participants may result in increased
regulation and legislative review of industry practices that further increase the Company&#146;s costs
of doing business and adversely affect its results of operations by:

manage correctional and detention facilities. The industry in which the Company operates is
subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations, including educational, healthcare,
pharmacy and safety regulations and judicial orders, decrees and judgments. Some of the
regulations are unique to the Company&#146;s industry, and the combination of regulations it faces is
unique. Generally, providers of healthcare services to correctional facilities must be able to
comply with a variety of applicable state and local regulations and court orders. The Company&#146;s
contracts typically include reporting requirements, supervision and on-site monitoring by
representatives of the contracting governmental agencies or courts. The Company may not always
successfully comply with these regulations or court orders, and failure to comply can result in
material penalties, sanctions or non-renewal or termination of contracts, which could have a
materially adverse affect on the Company&#146;s business and results of operation. For a discussion of
certain specific governmental regulations, see Item&nbsp;1. &#147;Business &#151; Government Regulations.&#148;

result in reduced reimbursements from its clients, refunds to its clients or civil or criminal
penalties. </I>Certain of the governmental agencies with which the Company contracts have the
authority to audit and investigate its contracts with them. As part of that process, governmental
agencies may review the Company&#146;s performance of the contract, its pricing practices, its cost
structure and its compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. For contracts that
actually or effectively provide for certain reimbursement of expenses, if an agency determines that
the Company has improperly allocated costs to a specific contract, it may not be reimbursed for
those costs, and it could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been
reimbursed. If a government audit asserts improper or illegal activities by the Company, it may be
subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of
contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or disqualification
from doing business with certain governmental entities. Any adverse determination could adversely
impact the Company&#146;s ability to bid in response to RFPs in one
or more jurisdictions and could
have a materially adverse affect on the Company&#146;s business and results of operation. Additionally,
as a result of any governmental agency investigations and/or audits, the Company&#146;s collections of
balances due from its customers could be substantially delayed. See risk factors below for more
information on the Company&#146;s risk of accounts receivable collection.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company&#146;s business is highly competitive and increased competition could harm its business
and operating results. </I>The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental
agencies is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. The Company is in direct competition
with local, regional and national correctional healthcare providers, including certain state
medical schools and other state or municipal organizations. The Company estimates that it
currently has approximately 6.6% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on its
estimates of national aggregate annual expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its
primary competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates currently has
approximately 7.1% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, and Wexford Health
Sources, Inc., which the Company estimates currently has approximately 2.2% of such market. The
market share estimates shown above for the Company reflect its contracts currently in place,
including the recently awarded contract to provide prisoner health care services to prisoners under
the care of the State of Michigan Department of Corrections beginning on April&nbsp;1, 2009. The market
share estimates shown above for Correctional Medical Services and Wexford Health Sources, Inc.,
reflect the Company&#146;s estimate of contracts currently held by these competitors and, for
Correctional Medical Services reflect the recent loss of the contract to provide prisoner health
care services to prisoners under the care of the State of Michigan Department of Corrections. For
further information related to the State of Michigan Department of Corrections contract award, see
Part&nbsp;1 &#151; Item&nbsp;1. &#147;Business &#151; Major Contracts.&#148; As the private market for providing correctional
healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s competitors may gain additional experience in bidding and
administering correctional healthcare contracts. Competitors may use the additional experience to
successfully bid against the Company. In addition, new competitors, some of whom may have
extensive experience in related fields or greater financial resources than the Company, may enter
the market. Increased competition could result in a loss of contracts and market share, or less
favorable contract terms, and could seriously harm the Company&#146;s business and operating results.

any future acquisitions and no assurances can be made that it will do so successfully. </I>The
Company&#146;s expansion strategy involves both internal growth and, as opportunities become available,
acquisitions. The inability to identify, fund and successfully integrate future acquisitions may
seriously reduce the Company&#146;s potential growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts expose it to costs related to catastrophic events, and
therefore any such event could adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition or results of
operations. </I>Contracts accounting for approximately 8.8% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare
services revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 contain no limits
on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to catastrophic illnesses or injuries to
inmates. Although the Company attempts to compensate for the increased financial risk when pricing
contracts that do not contain catastrophic limits and has not had any catastrophic illnesses or
injuries to inmates that exceeded its insurance coverage in the past, there can be no assurance
that the Company will not experience a catastrophic illness or injury of a patient that exceeds its
coverage in the future. The occurrence of severe individual cases outside of the catastrophic
limits contained in the Company&#146;s insurance coverage could render contracts unprofitable and could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company faces significant competition for qualified healthcare professionals and its
failure to attract such professionals could adversely affect its operating results. </I>The Company
faces stiff competition for staffing, which may increase its labor, professional liability and
other costs (including contractually mandated penalties) and reduce profitability. The Company
competes with other healthcare and service providers in recruiting qualified management and staff
personnel for the day-to-day operations of its business, including nurses and other healthcare
professionals. In some markets, the scarcity of physicians, nurses and other medical support
personnel is a significant operating issue to healthcare businesses. This scarcity may require the
Company to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified nurses and other healthcare
professionals. Because a significant percentage of the Company&#146;s existing contracts are structured
as fixed fee and/or population based contracts, the Company&#146;s ability to pass along increased labor
costs is limited. If the Company is not successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number
of qualified healthcare personnel in the future, it may not be able to perform under its contracts,
which could lead to the loss of existing contracts or its ability to obtain new contracts.
Moreover, lack of success in this area could further result in the provision of negligent
healthcare services or in the provision of untimely healthcare services, or in the allegation of
such negligent or untimely services (whether valid or invalid), any or all of which could increase
the Company&#146;s exposure to professional, medical, pharmaceutical or other liability expenses.
Additionally, approximately 44% of the Company&#146;s contracts contain financial penalties that apply
when performance or staffing criteria are not achieved. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the
Company incurred revenue deductions related to these criteria totaling approximately $0.4&nbsp;million,
or 0.1% of the Company&#146;s total healthcare revenues from continuing operations and discontinued
operations combined. Failure to attract qualified management and staff personnel for the
day-to-day operations of the Company&#146;s business could materially adversely affect the Company&#146;s
business and operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>As a result of its business, the Company is exposed to professional liability claims and can
provide no assurances that adequate levels of liability insurance will continue to be available or
that it will not be exposed to claims in excess of its insurance coverage. </I>The Company&#146;s business
ordinarily results in the Company becoming involved in actions for medical malpractice and other
claims related to the provision of healthcare services with the attendant risk of substantial
damage awards, or court endorsed non-monetary relief such as changes in operating practices or
procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in the Company&#146;s operating
expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits
brought by inmates (or their successors) alleging negligent healthcare services or the lack of
timely adequate healthcare services. The Company may also be liable, as employer, for the
negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or healthcare professionals or entities with whom
it contracts. All but one of the Company&#146;s contracts generally provides for the Company to
indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the Company
and its agents. The Company maintains professional and general liability insurance; however, due
to the use of adjustable premium policies in 2002 through 2006 and 2008, with respect to a majority
of its patients, the Company is effectively self-insured for professional liability claims incurred
under its primary program. For 2007, the Company is insured through a claims made policy subject
to per event and aggregate coverage limits. Any amounts ultimately incurred above the coverage
limits contained in the Company&#146;s professional and general liability insurance policies would be
the responsibility of the Company. In addition to its primary program, the Company also has
traditional risk transfer insurance policies that relate to certain specific healthcare services
contracts. Many of the Company&#146;s independent contractors maintain professional liability insurance
in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon the Company&#146;s claims history and the nature
and risks of its business. The Company indemnifies and pays for such coverage for some of its
independent contractors. Management establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will be
incurred under these insurance policies after taking into consideration the Company&#146;s professional
liability claims department and external counsel evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims, analysis of claim history, actuarial analysis and coverage limits where applicable.
However, there can be no assurance that a future claim or claims will not exceed management&#146;s loss
estimates or the limits of available insurance coverage, the result
of which could have a material adverse
impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>If the Company is unable to obtain adequate levels of insurance at reasonable costs its
business and results of operations may be adversely affected. </I>Adequate levels of malpractice and
other liability insurance may not continue to be available to the Company at a reasonable price or
at all. The Company is dependent on the financial health of the insurance carriers with whom it
has insurance policies. Substantially all of the Company&#146;s contracts require the Company to be
insured at certain levels. Failure to obtain sufficient levels of professional liability insurance
at a reasonable price or at all or deterioration in an insurance carrier&#146;s financial health, may
expose the Company to significant financial or contractual losses, which could have a material
adverse impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

significantly tighter credit markets and a recession that is expected
to continue through the end of 2009. As a result of these conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and
may continue to be adversely affected in the United States. Concern about the stability of the
markets, generally, and the strength of numerous financial institutions, specifically, has led many
lenders to reduce, and in some cases, cease, to provide funding to borrowers. If these market and
economic conditions continue, they may limit the Company&#146;s ability to borrow money from
CapitalSource Finance LLC or other lenders. If the Company is unable to borrow sufficient amounts

related to worker&#146;s compensation and professional liability claims for years 2002 to 2006 and 2008.
The Company&#146;s insurance coverage under these policies is essentially self-insurance in the form of
retro-premium adjustments based on actual claims experience. Under the terms of its insurance
coverage for these policy periods, the Company was required to prepay insurance premiums to its
third party insurance carrier, which are held by the third party insurance carrier to pay valid
claims made under the policies in the same or subsequent years. For the 2007 professional
liability claims policy, the Company has maintained an insurance policy that provides for per event
and aggregate coverage limits on a claims made basis based on a fixed paid premium. If the
financial position and/or liquidity of one of these third party insurance carriers were to become
impaired such that the third party insurer was unable to pay claims or meet its contractual
obligations to the Company, the Company could lose all or a portion
of its prepaid premiums to such carrier
and/or lose the benefit of the coverage it has paid for, the occurrence of which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its results of operations.

weeks pregnant, associated with the premature delivery of plaintiff&#146;s son and sought general and
special damages and reimbursement for costs and attorneys fees incurred by plaintiff in connection
with the litigation. The complaint also sought punitive damages alleging that the actions of PHS&#146;
named defendant employees met the minimum statutory standard for jury consideration of the
imposition of punitive damages against PHS, their employer. A jury trial commenced October&nbsp;28,
2008 and ended, November&nbsp;21, 2008. The verdict was received on November&nbsp;22, 2008 and consisted of
compensatory damages of $0.1&nbsp;million and punitive damages of $0.3&nbsp;million awarded to plaintiff, and
compensatory damages of $1.3&nbsp;million and punitive damages of $2.0&nbsp;million awarded to plaintiff&#146;s
son, resulting in an aggregate award of $3.6&nbsp;million. Additionally, the plaintiffs&#146; post-judgment,
pre-appeal motions seek the imposition of costs and attorneys fees totaling an estimated amount of
$2.4&nbsp;million based on contingency fee calculations. Post-trial motions were heard on January&nbsp;29,
2009, whereby PHS challenged the appropriateness and amounts of the verdict awarded to the
plaintiffs and vigorously opposed plaintiff&#146;s request for attorney fees on grounds of lack of
entitlement and method of calculation. At this time the trial court has not issued a ruling on
post-trial motions. PHS has filed an appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court seeking a reversal of the
adverse verdict and judgment described above, as it believes there were several reversible errors
made by the trial court. The Company believes that its appeal has merit and believes certain
aspects of the appeal will ultimately result in a reduction of the award or a remand to a new trial
on some or all of the claims. The Company believes that the possible loss associated with this
litigation ranges from $1.5&nbsp;million to $6.0&nbsp;million. The Company has recorded reserves equal to
the $3.6&nbsp;million verdict award discussed above. In the event that the trial court grants
plaintiffs&#146; request for attorney fees, such event could have a material adverse effect on the
Company and its financial position in the period in which the event occurs.

Inc. </I>On August&nbsp;1, 2005, plaintiff, Albert Einstein Healthcare Network, filed suit against the City
of Philadelphia (the &#147;City&#148;) and PHS in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, seeking
damages in the amount of $1.7&nbsp;million (plus interest) and punitive damages in the amount of $0.5
million. Plaintiff alleged that it rendered medical and/or surgical services to
prisoners/arrestees for which the defendants were obligated to pay pursuant to an implied contract
resulting from an extended course of dealing. Plaintiff alleged that defendants have failed to pay
for such services. Plaintiff has further alleged that PHS, in acting as the City&#146;s third party
administrator, fraudulently withheld payment for such services from plaintiff. On December&nbsp;27,
2005, the Court dismissed plaintiff&#146;s punitive damages claim. The City and the plaintiff then
entered into a formal settlement of the claims which involved the City paying an
undisclosed, compromised amount to the plaintiff in satisfaction of all outstanding fees for
services rendered. On March&nbsp;26, 2007, after being advised of said settlement, the Court entered an
order marking this action as &#147;Discontinued&#148; on the Court&#146;s docket. This Order effectively ended
the suit against PHS and the City, with prejudice.

Health Services, Inc. and City of Philadelphia. </I>On or about August&nbsp;2, 2006, plaintiff, an
individual physician independent contractor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a putative class
action suit against PHS and the City of Philadelphia (the &#147;City&#148;) in the Court of Common Pleas of
Philadelphia County, Trial Division, seeking unspecified damages for the class, but damages in the
amount of approximately $10,000 individually. Plaintiff alleges that he provided services to
inmates in the Philadelphia Prison System at the request of the defendants and that the defendants
breached the alleged contractual duties owed to him by paying an amount alleged to be less than the
full amount plaintiff billed for his medical services. On September&nbsp;22, 2006, the City filed a New
Matter Crossclaim against PHS alleging breach of contract, negligence and seeking indemnification.
On September&nbsp;29, 2006, PHS filed its Answer to plaintiff&#146;s complaint, which Answer included a
crossclaim against the City for contribution and indemnification. The plaintiff filed his motion
for class certification on October&nbsp;1, 2007; and PHS and the City responded to this motion. On
January&nbsp;16, 2009, the court denied the plaintiff&#146;s motion for class certification. The plaintiff
has indicated that he will appeal the trial court&#146;s ruling. While PHS believes that the trial
court&#146;s ruling denying class certification is sound and will be upheld on appeal, in the event the
appellate court overturns the trial court&#146;s ruling and PHS is not successful at trial, an adverse
judgment could have a material adverse affect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its results

Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center (&#147;St. Joseph&#146;s&#148;). Plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court of
New Jersey, Law Division: Passaic County, against CHS, Barnert Hospital, County of Bergen, Bergen
County Jail, County of Essex, Essex County Jail, County of Hudson, Hudson County Jail, County of
Passaic and Passaic County Jail, &#147;John Does #1-30&#148;, &#147;ABC Corporations #1-30&#148;, &#147;XYZ Jails, Prisons
and/or Detention Centers&#148; seeking damages from CHS totaling approximately $2.5&nbsp;million. Plaintiff
claims that CHS failed to administer various contracts with respect to medical claims for the
treatment of certain patients and the payment of such claims between each of the respective
counties and jails named in the complaint and Barnert Hospital, to which St. Joseph&#146;s claims it was
an intended third-party beneficiary. On August&nbsp;15, 2007, Barnert Hospital filed for Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy protection. As a result, the court has stayed the proceedings in the lawsuit pending
resolution of the bankruptcy. CHS intends to defend itself vigorously, and maintains that it is
not responsible for any payments that may be due and owing to the plaintiff. However, a judgment
adverse to CHS could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its
results of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company has no reserves associated with this
proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Prison Health Services, Inc. v. Hillsborough County Sheriff&#146;s Office. </I>On November&nbsp;5, 2007,
PHS filed suit against the Hillsborough County Sheriff&#146;s Office (&#147;HCSO&#148;) to recover approximately
$1.4&nbsp;million dollars owed to PHS by HCSO under the now-expired health services agreement between
the parties (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) which governed the parties&#146; relationship from December&nbsp;1, 2002
through September&nbsp;30, 2005. Approximately $0.7&nbsp;million of these receivables relate to billings for
costs incurred by PHS for offsite medical services and pharmacy costs which are in excess of PHS&#146;
maximum exposure for such costs as set forth under the Agreement. The remaining receivables
represent interest accrued on the past due balances under the terms of the Agreement. On February
12, 2008, HCSO filed its answer, affirmative defenses and a two-count counterclaim against PHS. As
its basis for refusing to pay the outstanding receivables, HCSO alleges that PHS did not make
sufficient efforts to identify whether alternative third party insurance payors were responsible
for payment of the offsite medical services in question. In regard to its counterclaims, HCSO
alleges (i)&nbsp;that PHS had the obligation to indemnify HCSO in the amount of $350,000 in settlement
costs incurred by HCSO in settling a medical malpractice lawsuit, and (ii)&nbsp;PHS failed to provide
proper management, maintenance and storage of on-site medical records resulting in HCSO incurring
an estimated $250,000 costs to convert its medical records into an electronic format. On February&nbsp;19, 2009, the parties agreed to settle all claims and counterclaims in dispute.
As a result of the settlement, the court entered an order on February&nbsp;24, 2009 dismissing the
lawsuit with prejudice. The parties are in the process of formalizing the terms of the settlement through a written agreement (the
&#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;). Upon execution of the Settlement Agreement and payment of the settlement
amount, the Company will consider this matter closed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Matters involving PHS and Baltimore County, Maryland. </I>PHS is currently involved in two
lawsuits with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;) with a third lawsuit
between the parties having been determined in favor of PHS. The lawsuit which is now decided
involved the term of PHS&#146; contract with the County. PHS contended that the original term of this
contract expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005, without the County exercising the first of three, two-year
renewal options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, PHS sent a letter to the County stating its position that PHS&#146;
contract to provide services expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s failure to provide such
extension notice. The County disputed PHS&#146; contention asserting that it properly exercised the
first renewal option and that the term of the contract therefore was through June&nbsp;30, 2007, with
extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In 2005, the County and PHS agreed to have a judicial
authority interpret the contract through formal judicial proceedings, and, at the County&#146;s request,
PHS continued to provide healthcare services to the County pending the judicial resolution of the
dispute, while reserving all of its rights. Finally, during September&nbsp;2006, amid reciprocal claims
of default, both PHS and the County took individual steps to terminate the relationship between the
parties. PHS contends that it terminated the relationship effective September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to
various breaches by the County.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the
County ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two year renewal option by sending a
faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed this ruling. On December&nbsp;6,
2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County
did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the
case to the Circuit Court to determine whether the County properly exercised the option by its
conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally decided by the Circuit Court. On May&nbsp;15,
2007, the Circuit Court, upon remand, held a hearing on the parties&#146; pending cross motions for
summary judgment. The Court issued an oral opinion at the end of the hearing indicating its
intention to rule in favor of the County&#146;s motion for summary judgment and against PHS&#146; motion for
summary judgment. On June&nbsp;6, 2007, the Court filed its order memorializing the aforementioned
ruling. In its order, the Court ruled that, by its actions, the County properly and timely
exercised the first two-year renewal option. The Company filed a Notice of Appeal and on May&nbsp;14,
2008, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals issued its ruling that the actions the County claimed
constituted an exercise of renewal were ineffective. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals
reversed the Circuit Court&#146;s ruling and directed it to grant the Company&#146;s motion for summary
judgment in the lawsuit. On June&nbsp;27, 2008, the County petitioned the Maryland Court of Appeals
(the State&#146;s highest appellate court) to review the May&nbsp;14, 2008 Court of Special Appeals decision.
By order dated August&nbsp;26, 2008, the Court of Appeals denied the County&#146;s request to review the
decision, resulting in the ruling of the Court of Special Appeals
in favor of the Company becoming final.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the remaining lawsuits revolves around the County&#146;s actions on or about May&nbsp;5,
2006, when it opened a new detention facility. PHS is of the opinion that this new facility was
not contemplated by the initial contract and represented a material increase in the staffing and
equipment required to provide services to the County. The County informed PHS that it expected PHS
to provide the same services at the new facility at no increase in price. Accordingly, on or about
July&nbsp;12, 2006, PHS filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against the County in the Circuit
Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking to have the Court declare that PHS is under no
obligation to provide personnel or services to the County at the new facility. During the pendency
of this lawsuit, PHS was providing services at the new facility under a reservation of rights.

this former client, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14,
2006. The County has refused to pay PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS
filed suit against the County in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking
collection of the outstanding receivable balances, damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit,
and unjust enrichment as well as prejudgment interest. PHS believes, in the case of this lawsuit,
that it has a valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the
outstanding receivables, which represent services performed under the relationship between the
parties, are probable of collection. However, although PHS believes it has valid contractual and
legal arguments, an adverse result in the remaining declaratory judgment action discussed above
could have a negative impact on the results of this matter and/or PHS&#146; ability to collect the
outstanding receivable amount.

December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company announced that its Audit Committee had concluded
its investigation and reached certain conclusions with respect to findings of the investigation
that resulted in the recording of amounts due to SPP&#146;s customers that were not charged in
accordance with the terms of their respective contracts.

Audit Committee and the issues being investigated, and, since that time, the Company has cooperated
with the SEC in an informal inquiry that it is conducting as well as with the Office of the U. S.
Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee in the informal inquiry it is conducting. Both the
Audit Committee and the Company intend to continue to cooperate with those government entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholder Litigation. </I>On April&nbsp;6, 2006, plaintiffs filed the first of four similar
securities class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Middle District
of Tennessee against the Company and the Company&#146;s Chief
Executive Officer, at the time, and Chief Financial
Officer. Plaintiffs&#146; allegations in these class action lawsuits are substantially identical and
generally allege on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased the Company&#146;s common
stock between September&nbsp;24, 2003 and March&nbsp;16, 2006 that, prior to the Company&#146;s announcement of
the Audit Committee investigation, the Company and/or the
Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, at the time, and
Chief Financial Officer violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934 and SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 by making false and misleading statements, or concealing information about
the Company&#146;s business, forecasts and financial performance. The complaints seek certification as
a class action, unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys&#146; fees and costs, and other relief. By
order dated August&nbsp;3, 2006, the district court consolidated the lawsuits into one consolidated
action and on October&nbsp;31, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding SPP, Enoch E. Hartman
III and Grant J. Bryson as defendants. Enoch E. Hartman III is a former employee of the Company
and SPP and Grant J. Bryson is a former employee of SPP. The amended complaint also generally
alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements concerning the Company&#146;s business
which caused the Company&#146;s securities to trade at inflated prices during the class period.
Plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of damages in the form of (i)&nbsp;restitution; (ii)&nbsp;compensatory
damages, including interest; and (iii)&nbsp;reasonable costs and expenses. Defendants moved to dismiss
the amended complaint on January&nbsp;19, 2007, and the parties completed the briefs on the motion in
May&nbsp;2007. This motion, therefore, is currently pending before the presiding judge.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Company believes that it has meritorious liability and damages defenses to the
securities class action and intends to defend it vigorously, it is unable at this time to predict
the outcome of this action or, if adversely determined, reasonably estimate a range of possible
damages. The Company maintains directors and officers liability (&#147;D&#038;O&#148;) insurance that may provide
coverage for some or all of these matters. It has given notice to its D&#038;O insurers of the claims
described above. There is risk that some or all of the claims will not be covered by such
policies; or that, even if covered, the Company&#146;s ultimate liability will exceed the
available limits of insurance. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a
material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of
operations or stock price.

notifying it that the Office of the Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice is conducting
an inquiry into the indirect payment of claims by the Delaware Department of Correction to SPP
beginning in July&nbsp;2002 and ending in the Spring of 2005 for pharmaceutical services. There can be
no assurance that the Delaware Department of Justice inquiry will not result in the Company:
incurring additional investigation and related expenses; being required to make additional refunds;
incurring criminal, or civil penalties, including the imposition of fines; or being debarred from
pursuing future business in certain jurisdictions. Management of the Company is unable to predict
the effect that any such actions may have on its business, financial condition, results of
operations or stock price. The Company has cooperated and intends to continue to cooperate with

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by its more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its condensed consolidated financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts to provide healthcare services to correctional institutions are
principally fixed price contracts with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing
arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions and aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical
costs. Such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options
and generally may be terminated by either party without cause upon proper notice. Revenues earned
under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are
rendered. Cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and
recognized as income when the service is performed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fixed fee contracts, revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in
the service contract irrespective of inmate population. Revenues for population-based contracts
are calculated either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for
variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate
multiplied by the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">average inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee contracts, revenues
are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Company&#146;s contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a
portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in
the majority of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses,
stop-loss provisions, cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of
certain or all off-site service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of
the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically, under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue
under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site
expenses or pharmaceutical costs. For contracts that include such provisions, the Company
recognizes the additional revenues due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract
to date costs incurred as compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs.
Because such provisions typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and
require all such additional revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the
additional revenues are initially recorded as unbilled receivables until the time period for
billing has been met and actual costs are known. Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates
of incurred costs and the actual costs are recorded in the period in which such differences become
known along with the corresponding adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related
criteria. If necessary, the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods
when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon
delivery of the related products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table below illustrates these revenue categories as a percentage of total revenues from
continuing operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts under the population based and fixed fee categories generally have similar margins
which are higher than margins for contracts under the cost plus a fee category. Cost plus a fee
contracts generally have lower margins but with much less potential for variability due to the
limited risk involved. The Company&#146;s profitability under each of the three general contract
categories discussed above varies based on the level of risk assumed under the contract terms with
the most potential for variability being in contracts under the population based or fixed fee
categories which do not contain the risk mitigating provisions related to off-site utilization
described above. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, contracts accounting for approximately 8.8%
of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing operations do not
contain such risk mitigating provisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and other healthcare
professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing and/or
administering the managed care, including, the costs associated with services provided and/or
administered by off-site medical providers, the costs of professional and general liability
insurance and other self-funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below. Many of the
Company&#146;s contracts require the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for all treatment
costs or, in some cases, only treatment costs related to certain catastrophic events, and/or for
specific disease diagnoses illnesses. Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts do not contain such
limits. The Company attempts to compensate for the increased financial risk when pricing contracts
that do not contain individual, catastrophic or specific disease diagnosis-related limits.
However, the occurrence of severe individual cases, specific disease diagnoses illnesses or a
catastrophic event in a facility governed by a contract without such limitations could render the
contract unprofitable and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations. For
certain of its contracts that do not contain catastrophic protection, the Company maintains stop
loss insurance from an unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among other things, inpatient and
outpatient hospital expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in excess of $375,000 per
inmate up to an annual cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate. Amounts reimbursable per claim under the
policy are further limited to the lessor of 60% of billed charges, the amount paid or the
contracted amounts in situations where the Company has negotiated rates with the applicable
providers.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of healthcare services provided, administered or contracted for are recognized in the
period in which they are provided and/or administered based in part on estimates, including an
accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date. The
Company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization data including
hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and
their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the average historical cost of such services.
Additionally, the Company&#146;s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient
hospital stays in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the historical
average rates. Once identified, reserves for such stays are determined which take into
consideration the specific facts of the stay. An actuarial analysis is also prepared at least
quarterly as an additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the
Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims payment history. The
analysis takes into account historical claims experience (including the average historical costs
and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial data.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant fluctuations occur in the healthcare
cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of claims resulting
from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are
recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made. In 2008,
2007 and 2006, the Company recorded decreases of approximately $0.7&nbsp;million, $6.1&nbsp;million and $0.6
million, respectively, to its prior year claims liabilities as a result of revisions to its
estimated claims expense. The impact to net income (loss)&nbsp;of these reductions to the Company&#146;s
claims reserves and associated expense is dependent upon whether any of the associated customer
contracts contained provisions limiting risk of off-site costs. For 2007, the overall decrease in
claims liabilities is net of an increase to the claims liabilities associated with two former full
risk contracts resulting in a negative impact to the Company&#146;s net income (loss)&nbsp;of $0.7&nbsp;million.
The reductions to claims reserves in 2008 and 2006 did not result in a significant impact to the
Company&#146;s net income (loss)&nbsp;as the changes occurred primarily in connection with contracts which
contained provisions limiting risk of off-site costs and, as a result, these changes were off-set
by corresponding reductions to revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with other information, an actuarial analysis is prepared at least quarterly as an
additional tool in evaluating the adequacy of the Company&#146;s reserves for self-insurance retention
for certain reported as well as unreported professional and general liability claims associated
with the delivery of medical services and included in accrued expenses and the noncurrent portion
of accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Reserves for medical
malpractice claims fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying
incidents change from one period to the next. Furthermore, payments with respect to previously
estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability. Changes in estimates of
losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss
payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the
period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made and a corresponding change in
healthcare expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss
has been incurred (i.e., expected future healthcare costs and maintenance costs will exceed
anticipated future revenue) and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company
performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. The Company recognizes
allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors, including the length of time
receivables are past due, significant one-time events, contractual rights, client funding and/or
political pressures, discussions with clients and historical experience. If circumstances change,
estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted and such adjustments could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which they
are recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbilled accounts receivable generally represent additional revenue earned under shared-risk
contracting models that remain unbilled at each balance sheet date, due to provisions within the
contracts governing the timing for billing such amounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its clients will, from time to time, have disputes over amounts billed under
the Company&#146;s contracts. The Company records a reserve for contractual allowances in
circumstances where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable. The Company&#146;s more
significantly aged receivable balances, net of reserves, are discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed more fully in Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; at December&nbsp;31, 2008, PHS had
approximately $1.4&nbsp;million of gross billed receivables due from a former client, Hillsborough
County Sheriff&#146;s Office (&#147;HCSO&#148;) whose contract terminated prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006. Approximately
$0.7&nbsp;million of these receivables relate to billings for costs incurred by the Company for offsite
medical services and pharmacy costs which are in excess of the Company&#146;s maximum exposure for such
costs as set forth under the Company&#146;s contract that was in effect with HCSO. The remaining
receivables represent interest accrued on the past due balances under the terms of the contract.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has recorded reserves
totaling approximately $0.7&nbsp;million related to these receivables. The parties are in the process of formalizing the terms of a settlement agreement (the
&#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;). Upon execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Company expects that the
net receivable balances will be collected. These
receivables are classified in current assets in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed more fully in Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; PHS is currently involved in
two lawsuits with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;); one of the two
lawsuits involves the County&#146;s lack of payment for services rendered. PHS has approximately $1.7
million of receivables due from the County, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1,
2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006, the date the Company&#146;s relationship with the County was terminated.
The County has refused to pay PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS filed
suit against the County in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of
the outstanding receivable balances, damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust
enrichment as well as prejudgment interest. PHS believes, in the case of this lawsuit, that it has
a valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the outstanding
receivables, which represent services performed under the relationship between the parties, are
probable of collection. However, although PHS believes it has valid contractual and legal
arguments, an adverse result in this lawsuit could
have a negative impact on the results of this matter and/or PHS&#146; ability to collect the outstanding
receivable amount. These receivables are classified as other noncurrent assets in the Company&#146;s
consolidated balance sheet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in each of the cases above, the Company believes the recorded amounts represent
valid receivables which are contractually due from clients, and, other than the recorded reserves,
expects full collection. However, due to the factors discussed above, there is a heightened risk
of uncollectibility of these receivables which may result in future losses in excess of such
reserves. Nevertheless, the Company intends to take all necessary and available measures in order
to collect these receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in circumstances related to the matters discussed above, or any other receivables,
could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate of contractual
adjustments in future periods. Such change, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse
affect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position in the period in which the
change occurs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was involved in a dispute with a former client whose contract term ended on
October&nbsp;31, 2007, where the client withheld approximately $2.2&nbsp;million from payments of receivables
due the Company. The Company had recorded approximately $1.5&nbsp;million of contractual allowances
which it estimated as the amount potentially due to the client related to staffing penalties under
the contract. The Company challenged the former client&#146;s ability to assess staffing penalties
under the initial term of the contract and the method of calculating the assessment. The remaining
$0.7&nbsp;million of the withheld amount due from this former client was primarily related to liquidated
damages assessed by the former client. The Company challenged this amount withheld for liquidated
damages as well as the process by which the damages were estimated by the former client. The
contract with the former client set forth specific items for which damages could be assessed and
maximum damage amounts that can be assessed for each item. The former client&#146;s assessment of
damages did not relate to items for which damages could be assessed under the terms of the contract
nor did it provide a calculation of the method used to estimate the damages for the alleged
deficiencies. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company and the former client entered into a
settlement agreement under the terms of which the outstanding receivables were satisfied with no
material impact to the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was involved in a dispute with a current client over billed receivables totaling
approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, net of reserves. These receivables were invoiced to the client in the
second quarter of 2006 and represent amounts paid under a settlement between the Company and a
local healthcare provider. Under the terms of the contract between the Company and this client,
the Company is allowed to bill the client for costs incurred such as those described above. During
the second quarter of 2008, the Company and the client reached a settlement agreement under the
terms of which the client paid the Company $1.0&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Loss Contracts</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying potential loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for
succeeding periods if any loss contracts are identified. The Company accrues losses under its
contracts when it is probable that a material loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated. The Company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract
basis taking into consideration such factors as the Company&#146;s ability to terminate the contract,
future contractual revenue, projected future labor, pharmacy and healthcare costs,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">including hospitalization and outpatient services, and each contract&#146;s specific terms related
to risk-sharing arrangements. The projected future healthcare costs are estimated based on
historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost increases. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the
Company&#146;s review identified no loss contracts and therefore the Company has not recorded a loss
contract reserve.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might identify
contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances. Circumstances that
might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period
include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions, unanticipated
adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the utilization of outside
medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues.
If a contract is identified as a loss contract in a future period, the Company will record, in the
period in which such identification is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that would
be incurred under the contract. The identification of a loss contract in the future could have a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which the reserve
is recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no loss contracts identified as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-Insurance Retention</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company&#146;s business occasionally results in actions for
negligence and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the
attendant risk of substantial damage awards, or court ordered non-monetary relief such as, changes
in operating practices or procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in
the Company&#146;s operating expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard
is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services, deliberate
indifference to their medical needs or the lack of timely or adequate healthcare services. The
Company may also be liable, as employer, for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs
or healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The Company&#146;s contracts generally provide for
the Company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided
by the Company and its agents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains a primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. For 2002 through 2006 and 2008 with respect to the
majority of its patients, the Company purchased commercial insurance coverage, but is effectively
self-insured due to the terms of the coverage which include adjustable premiums. For 2002 through
2006 and 2008, the Company is covered by separate policies each of which contains a premium that is
retroactively adjusted, with adjustment based on actual losses. The Company&#146;s ultimate premium for
its 2002 through 2006 and 2008 policies will depend on the final incurred losses related to each of
these separate policy periods. For 2007, the Company is insured through claims made policies
subject to per event and aggregate coverage limits. Any amounts ultimately incurred above these
coverage limits would be the responsibility of the Company. Management establishes reserves for
the estimated losses that will be incurred under these insurance policies after taking into
consideration the Company&#146;s professional liability claims department and external counsel
evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis of claim history, actuarial analysis
and coverage limits where applicable. Any adjustments resulting from the review are reflected in
current earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence, in addition to
its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported
claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by various analyses, including an actuarial
analysis, which are performed on a quarterly basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company&#146;s reserves for both known and incurred but not reported
claims totaled $22.0&nbsp;million. Reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number
of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next.
Furthermore, payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the
estimated liability. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and
differences between management&#146;s established reserves and actual loss payments are recognized by an
adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which the estimates are
changed or payments are made. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded increases of
approximately $6.3&nbsp;million, $10.5&nbsp;million and $4.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims
reserves as a result of adverse development on individual claims or matters. The reserves can also
be affected by changes in the financial health of the third-party insurance carriers used by the
Company. If a third party insurance carrier fails to meet its contractual obligations under the
agreement with the Company, the Company would then be responsible for such obligations. Such
changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period
in which the changes occur.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company has approximately $7.5&nbsp;million in accrued liabilities for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. Approximately $6.3&nbsp;million of this amount is
related to workers&#146; compensation claims, of which approximately $3.3&nbsp;million is included within the
noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is not expected to be paid within a year. The Company
is essentially self-insured for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain
individual case stop-loss levels. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims
experience and the ability to control claims. The Company accrues the estimated liability for
employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between
the incident date and the date of actual claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated
liability for workers&#146; compensation claims based on evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims and analysis of claims history. An actuarial analysis is prepared at least annually as an
additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the Company&#146;s reserve
for workers&#146; compensation claims. These estimates of self-funded insurance reserves could change
in the future based on changes in the factors discussed above. Any adjustments resulting from such
changes in estimates are reflected in current earnings. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company
recorded a decrease of approximately $0.9&nbsp;million, and increases of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million and
$0.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year other self-insurance reserves as a result of
revisions to its estimated claims experience.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to professional and general liability claims, the Company is also subject to other
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such proceedings generally relate to labor,
employment or contract matters. When estimable, the Company accrues an estimate of the probable
costs for the resolution of these claims. Such estimates are developed in consultation with outside
counsel handling the Company&#146;s defense in these matters and are based upon an estimated range of
potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. The Company
does not believe any of these current proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position. However, it is possible that future results of operations for
any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions,
new developments or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with
such litigation. See discussion of certain outstanding legal matters in Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal

Intangible Assets, </I>(&#147;SFAS 142&#148;), goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment
on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying

Based on the results of this annual review, management has determined that goodwill is not impaired
as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and that the Company&#146;s goodwill is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could

techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value
of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation
techniques.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company determines that the carrying value of other intangible assets may not be
recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, any
impairment is measured using an estimate of the asset&#146;s fair value based on the projected net cash
flows expected to result from that asset, including eventual disposition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Amortizable Life of Contract Intangibles</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company amortizes its contract intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life. The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles
on at least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and circumstances, including its
retention rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and circumstances indicate the current
estimated useful life is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the estimated useful life on a
prospective basis. For periods prior to March&nbsp;1, 2008, the estimated useful life of the Company&#146;s
contract intangible related to the CHS acquisition, was 20&nbsp;years. Effective March&nbsp;1, 2008, the
Company revised the estimated useful life of the contract intangible from 20&nbsp;years to 16.67&nbsp;years.
The revision of the estimated useful life impacts contract intangibles with a gross value of $4.0
million and will result in an increase to amortization expense of approximately $80,000 per year.
The increase in amortization expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was approximately
$66,000.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;109&#148;). Under the asset and liability method of SFAS
No.&nbsp;109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance
of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million represents management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss
carryforwards which will expire unused.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for tax contingency accruals under the provisions of Interpretation
No.&nbsp;48, <I>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#151; an interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109</I>
(&#147;FIN 48&#148;). Company&#146;s tax contingency accruals are reviewed quarterly and can be adjusted in light
of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging
legislation. Adjustments to the tax contingency accruals are recorded in the period in which the
new facts or circumstances become known, therefore the accruals are subject to change in future
periods and such change, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Company&#146;s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to its tax
contingencies as income tax expense. As the Company has no tax contingencies at December&nbsp;31, 2008,
there is no accrued interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state
jurisdictions. The Company may be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;)
for calendar years 2005 through 2008. Additionally, open tax years related to certain state and
local jurisdictions remain subject to examination.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Share-Based Compensation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004),
<I>Share-Based Payment</I>, the Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant. Determining the fair value of
share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a
number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price
volatility over the term of the awards and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition,
the Company also uses judgment in estimating the number of share-based awards that are expected to
be forfeited.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 7 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, the Company is
applying the discontinued operations provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;), to all correctional healthcare service contracts that expire subsequent to
January&nbsp;1, 2002. SFAS No.&nbsp;144 requires the Company to follow the income statement presentation
format described in SFAS No.&nbsp;144. The results of operations of contracts that expire, less
applicable income taxes, are classified on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations
separately from continuing operations. The presentation prescribed for discontinued operations
requires the collapsing of healthcare revenues and expenses, as well as other specifically
identifiable costs, into the income or loss from discontinued operations. Items such as indirect
selling, general and administrative expenses or interest expense cannot be allocated to expired
contracts. The application of the SFAS No.&nbsp;144 accounting presentation to expired contracts has no
impact on net income, earnings per share, total cash flows or stockholders&#146; equity. As a result of
the application of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;healthcare revenues&#148; and &#147;healthcare expenses&#148; on the Company&#146;s
consolidated statements of operations for any period presented will only include revenues and
expenses from continuing contracts.

outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement for the month and the balance of any outstanding
letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will be due and payable on October&nbsp;31,
2011. If the Amended Credit Agreement is extinguished prior to July&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company will be
required to pay an early termination fee equal to between 1.0% and 3.0% of the Borrowing Capacity
depending on the date extinguished. The Amended Credit Agreement requires a lockbox agreement
which provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. The mandatory
lockbox agreement, combined with the existence of a Material Adverse Effect (&#147;MAE&#148;) clause in the
Amended Credit Agreement, requires any outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to
be classified as a current liability, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue
No.&nbsp;95-22, <I>Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements
that Include Both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement </I>(&#147;EITF 95-22&#148;). The
MAE clause, which is a common requirement in commercial credit agreements, allows the lender to
require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s operations, business, properties, assets, liabilities, condition or prospects. The
Amended Credit Agreement does not expire or have a maturity date within one year and any outstanding balances would only be
classified as a current liability due to the mandatory lockbox agreement and the existence of a MAE
clause in accordance with EITF 95-22. As discussed above, the Credit Agreement has a final
expiration date of October&nbsp;31, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain both a minimum level of EBITDA
of $8.0&nbsp;million and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.75 on a trailing twelve-month basis
to be measured at the end of each calendar quarter. The Amended Credit Agreement defines EBITDA as
net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, any
other non-cash non-recurring expense and loss from asset sales outside of the normal course of
business, minus gains on asset sales outside the normal course of business or other non-recurring
gains. The Amended Credit Agreement defines the fixed charge coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined
above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding debt, cash interest expense on
outstanding debt, capital expenditures, cash income taxes paid or accrued, and cash dividends paid
or accrued or declared.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was in compliance with the Amended Credit Agreement covenant requirements at
December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Company currently believes that cash flows from operating activities, its available cash, and its
expected available credit under the Amended Credit Agreement will continue to enable it to meet its
contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. The
Company may, from time to time, consider acquisitions involving other companies or assets. Such acquisitions
or other opportunities may require the Company to raise additional capital by expanding its
existing credit facility and /or issuing debt or equity, as market conditions permit. If the Company
is unable to obtain such additional capital on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all, it
could have inadequate capital to operate its business, meet its
contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements or fund potential acquisitions.
Current market and economic conditions, including turmoil and uncertainty in the financial services industry
and credit markets and a global recession that is expected to
continue through the end of 2009, have
caused credit markets to tighten and led many lenders and
institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide, funding to borrowers. Should the
credit markets not improve, the Company can make no assurances that it would be able to secure
additional financing if needed and, if such funds were available, whether the terms or conditions
would be acceptable.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Company&#146;s contracts provide for annual increases in the base fixed fee based upon
changes in the regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts
that extend beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of its
cost of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. If the rate of
inflation exceeds the levels projected, the excess costs will be absorbed by the Company with the
financial impact dependent upon contract structure. Conversely, the Company may benefit should the
actual rate of inflation fall below the estimate used in the bidding and negotiation process.

issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair Value Measurement </I>(&#147;SFAS No.
157&#148;), which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, including a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop fair value assumptions. It
also requires expanded disclosure about the extent to which companies measure assets and
liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value
measurements on earnings. The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets
or liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not expand the use of fair value in any new
circumstances.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November&nbsp;15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. However, on February&nbsp;12, 2008,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.&nbsp;FAS 157-2, <I>Effective Date of FASB Statement No. </I>157 (&#147;FSP
157-2&#148;). FSP 157-2 amends SFAS No.&nbsp;157 to delay the effective date of SFAS No.&nbsp;157 to fiscal years
beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years, for nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company adopted the non-deferred
provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;157 on January&nbsp;1, 2008 and the adoption did not have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations. The Company does not expect the adoption of the
deferred provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;157 to have a material impact on its financial position or results
of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</I>. In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;159, <I>The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;159&#148;). SFAS No.&nbsp;159 provides entities with the
one-time option to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings as they occur. The fair value option may be applied
instrument by instrument (with a few exceptions), is irrevocable, and must be applied to entire
instruments and not to portions of an instrument.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial statements
of the Company due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company&#146;s exposure to market risk is
primarily related to changes in the variable interest rate under the Amended Credit Agreement in
2008. The Credit Agreement carries an interest rate based on the one-month LIBOR rate; therefore
the Company&#146;s cash flow may be affected by changes in the one-month LIBOR rate. A hypothetical
10% change in the underlying interest rate would have would have had no material effect on interest
expense paid under the Credit Agreement. Interest expense represents
0.1% and 0.4% of the
Company&#146;s revenues for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company has
no debt outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2008.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure controls and procedures are the Company&#146;s controls and other procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported in a complete, accurate and appropriate manner, within the time
periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company evaluated under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures,
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;13a-15 and Rule&nbsp;15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules&nbsp;13a &#151; 15(f).
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;). Based on management&#146;s assessment
under such framework, management concluded that the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.

reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria<B>.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of America Service Group Inc. as of December
31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and our report dated
March&nbsp;3, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America Service Group Inc. (the
&#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31,
2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule referenced at Item&nbsp;15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of America Service Group Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2008
and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company
changed its method of accounting for income tax contingencies in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.&nbsp;48.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March&nbsp;3, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America Service Group Inc. (&#147;ASG&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) and its consolidated subsidiaries provide
managed healthcare services to correctional facilities under contracts with state and local
governments and certain private entities. The health status of inmates impacts the results of
operations under such contractual arrangements. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Prison Health Services, Inc. (&#147;PHS&#148;),
EMSA Limited Partnership, Correctional Health Services, LLC (&#147;CHS&#148;) and Secure Pharmacy Plus, LLC
(&#147;SPP&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;12, 2007, SPP and PHS, as guarantor, entered into an asset purchase agreement with
Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corporation (&#147;Maxor&#148;) whereby SPP agreed to sell certain of its
assets at net book value (the &#147;Transaction&#148;). The closing of the Transaction occurred on May&nbsp;3,
2007, with an effective date as of April&nbsp;30, 2007. The net book value of the assets included in
the Transaction was approximately $3.8&nbsp;million as of April&nbsp;30, 2007, which consisted of
approximately $1.9&nbsp;million in inventory and approximately $2.0&nbsp;million in fixed assets, offset by
approximately $0.1&nbsp;million of liabilities for accrued vacation assumed by Maxor. Additionally, as
a condition to the closing of the Transaction, Maxor and PHS entered into a long-term pharmacy
services agreement (the &#147;Services Agreement&#148;) pursuant to which Maxor became the provider of
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to PHS. The Services Agreement commenced effective May&nbsp;1,
2007 and will remain in effect until October&nbsp;31, 2014 (unless terminated earlier in accordance with
the terms of the Services Agreement). During the term of the Services Agreement, PHS will utilize
Maxor on an exclusive basis to provide pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical supplies to PHS,
except in certain specified situations, including when a PHS client elects or requires PHS to
utilize another pharmacy services provider.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Principles of Consolidation</I>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Use of Estimates</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates, which could be material to the Company&#146;s
financial condition and results of operations. Some of the more significant areas requiring
estimates in the financial statements include the Company&#146;s estimate of refunds due to customers
as a result of the investigation performed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company (the &#147;Audit Committee&#148;) into certain matters related to the Company&#146;s subsidiary, Secure
Pharmacy Plus, LLC (&#147;SPP&#148;), accruals for unbilled medical services calculated based upon a claims
payment lag methodology, realization of goodwill, estimated amortizable life of contract
intangibles, reductions in revenue for contractual allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts,
legal contingencies, employee health, workers&#146; compensation and professional and general liability
claims for which the Company is substantially self-insured and share-based compensation.
Estimates change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, or additional information is
obtained. A change in an estimate is accounted for in the period of change.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets consist of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and
revolving credit facility. Due to the short term nature of these instruments and the variable
interest rate nature of the revolving credit facility, the carrying amounts approximate fair
value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts
with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing arrangements, such as stop-loss
provisions and aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical costs. Such contracts typically
have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and generally may be terminated
by either party

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">without cause upon proper notice. Revenues earned under contracts with correctional
institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered. Cash received in advance for
future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the service is
performed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fixed fee contracts, revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in
the service contract irrespective of inmate population. Revenues for population-based contracts
are calculated either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for
variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate
multiplied by the average inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee
contracts, revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus
a contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Company&#146;s contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a
portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in
the majority of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses,
stop-loss provisions, cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of
certain or all off-site service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of
the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically, under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue
under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site
expenses or pharmaceutical costs. For contracts which include such provisions, the Company
recognizes the additional revenues due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract
to date costs incurred as compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs.
Because such provisions typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and
require all such additional revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the
additional revenues are initially recorded as unbilled receivables until the time period for
billing has been met and actual costs are known. Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates
of incurred costs and the actual costs are recorded in the period in which such differences become
known along with the corresponding adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related
criteria. If necessary, the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods
when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon
delivery of the related products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table below illustrates these revenue categories as a percentage of total revenues from
continuing operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts under the population based and fixed fee categories generally have similar margins
which are higher than margins for contracts under the cost plus a fee category. Cost plus a fee
contracts generally have lower margins but with much less potential for variability due to the
limited risk involved. The Company&#146;s profitability under each of the three general contract
categories discussed above varies based on the level of risk assumed under the contract terms with
the most potential for variability being in contracts under the population based or fixed fee
categories which do not contain the risk mitigating provisions related to off-site utilization
described above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below. Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require
the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for all treatment costs or, in some cases, only
treatment costs related to certain catastrophic events, and/or for specific disease diagnoses
illnesses. Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts do not contain such limits. The Company attempts to
compensate for the increased financial risk when pricing contracts that do not contain individual,
catastrophic or specific disease diagnosis-related limits. However, the occurrence of severe
individual cases, specific disease diagnoses illnesses or a catastrophic event in a facility
governed by a contract without such limitations could render the contract unprofitable and could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations. For certain of its contracts that do
not contain catastrophic protection, the Company maintains stop loss insurance from an
unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital
expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual
cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate. Amounts reimbursable per claim under the policy are further
limited to the lessor of 60% of billed charges, the amount paid or the contracted amounts in
situations where the Company has negotiated rates with the applicable providers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of healthcare services provided, administered or contracted for are recognized in the
period in which they are provided and/or administered based in part on estimates, including an
accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date. The
Company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization data including
hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and
their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the average historical cost of such services.
Additionally, the Company&#146;s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient
hospital stays in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the historical
average rates. Once identified, reserves for such stays are determined which take into
consideration the specific facts of the stay. An actuarial analysis is also prepared at least
quarterly as an additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the
Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims payment history. The
analysis takes into account historical claims experience (including the average historical costs
and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial data.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant fluctuations occur in the healthcare
cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of claims resulting
from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are
recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made. In 2008,
2007 and 2006, the Company recorded decreases of approximately $0.7&nbsp;million, $6.1&nbsp;million and $0.6
million, respectively, to its prior year claims liabilities as a result of revisions to its
estimated claims expense. The impact to net income and earnings per share of these reductions to
the Company&#146;s claims reserves and associated expense is dependent upon whether any of the
associated customer contracts contained provisions limiting risk of off-site costs. For 2007, the
overall decrease in claims liabilities is net of an increase to the claims liabilities associated
with two former full risk contracts resulting in a negative impact to the Company&#146;s net income
(loss)&nbsp;and basic and diluted net income (loss)&nbsp;per common share of $0.7&nbsp;million and $0.07 per
common share, respectively. The reductions to claims reserves in 2008 and 2006 did not result in a
significant impact to the Company&#146;s net income (loss)&nbsp;or basic and diluted net income (loss)&nbsp;per
common share as the changes occurred primarily in connection with contracts which contained
provisions limiting risk of off-site costs and, as a result, these changes were off-set by
corresponding reductions to revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with other information, an actuarial analysis is prepared at least quarterly as an
additional tool in evaluating the adequacy of the Company&#146;s reserves for self-insurance retention
for certain reported as well as unreported professional and general liability claims associated
with the delivery of medical services and included in accrued expenses and the noncurrent portion
of accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Reserves for medical
malpractice claims fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying
incidents change from one period to the next. Furthermore, payments with respect to previously
estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability. Changes in estimates of
losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss
payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the
period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made and a corresponding change in
healthcare expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss
has been incurred (i.e., expected future healthcare costs and maintenance costs will exceed
anticipated future revenue) and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company
performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis (see Note 6).

existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment or as a result of its annual
impairment review, any impairment is measured using a fair-value-based goodwill impairment test as
required under the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;142. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could
be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a
number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value
techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value
of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation
techniques.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of its annual review at December&nbsp;31, 2008, management has determined
that goodwill is not impaired. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and that the Company&#146;s goodwill is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could
have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Contracts and Other Intangibles</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its contract and other intangibles
when events and circumstances warrant, generally in conjunction with the annual business planning
cycle. If the carrying value of the evaluated asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized
based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value. Fair market value
is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company amortizes its contract intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life. The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles
on at least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and circumstances, including its
retention rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and circumstances indicate the current
estimated useful life is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the estimated useful life on a
prospective basis. For periods prior to March&nbsp;1, 2008, the estimated useful life of the Company&#146;s
contract intangible related to the CHS acquisition, was 20&nbsp;years. Effective March&nbsp;1, 2008, the
Company revised the estimated useful life of the contract intangible from 20&nbsp;years to 16.67&nbsp;years.
The revision of the estimated useful life impacts contract intangibles with a gross value of $4.0
million and will result in an increase to amortization expense of approximately $80,000 per year.
The increase in amortization expense for year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was approximately $66,000.
Contract amortization expense totaled approximately $1.7&nbsp;million, $1.6&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other intangibles are comprised primarily of non-compete agreements. Amortization of
non-compete agreements is calculated over the term of the related agreements (2 to 10&nbsp;years) and
approximates $0.2&nbsp;million for each of the three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Assets</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 include cash deposits totaling approximately $3.3
million and $6.4&nbsp;million, respectively, which are held by the Company&#146;s professional liability
insurer and workers compensation insurer and are not expected to be utilized within the next year.
In addition to cash deposits recorded within other assets, the Company has recorded cash
deposits for professional liability claims losses totaling $6.1&nbsp;million and $4.5&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, within prepaid expenses and other current assets, which
are expected to be utilized within a year. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s professional
liability insurance policies for 2002 through 2006 and 2008, this cash will be used by the insurer
to pay any professional liability claims made against the Company during those years. Based on
evaluation of outstanding claims, management estimates the amount of cash deposits that will be
utilized by the insurer to pay losses within a year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 are deferred financing costs
associated with the Company&#146;s credit facility (see Note 14). Such costs are being amortized over
the life of the credit facility and are included in interest expense on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense associated with deferred financing
costs was approximately $40,000, $0.1&nbsp;million and $0.1&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Disposal of Long-Lived Assets </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;), requires the Company to consider whether
indicators of impairment of long-lived assets held for use (including the Company&#146;s property and
equipment, contracts and other intangibles) are present. If such indicators are present, the
Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to
such assets is less than their carrying amount, and if so, recognizes an impairment loss based on
the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value. Accordingly, management
periodically evaluates the ongoing value of property and equipment and intangible assets and
considers events, circumstances and operating results, including consideration of contract
performance at the fixed price contract level, to determine if impairment exists. If long-lived
assets are deemed impaired, management adjusts the asset value to fair value.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;109&#148;). Under the asset and liability method of SFAS
No.&nbsp;109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance
of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million represents management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss
carryforwards which will expire unused.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for tax contingency accruals under the provisions of Interpretation No.
48, <I>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#151; an interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109 </I>(&#147;FIN
48&#148;). The Company&#146;s tax contingency accruals are reviewed quarterly and can be adjusted in light
of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging
legislation. Adjustments to the tax contingency accruals are recorded in the period in which the
new facts or circumstances become known, therefore the accruals are subject to change in future
periods and such change, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Company&#146;s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to its tax
contingencies as income tax expense. As the Company has no tax contingencies at December&nbsp;31, 2008,
there is no accrued interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state
jurisdictions. The Company may be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;)
for calendar years 2005 through 2008. Additionally, open tax years related to certain state and
local jurisdictions remain subject to examination.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-Insurance Retention</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company&#146;s business occasionally results in actions for
negligence and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the
attendant risk of substantial damage awards, or court ordered non-monetary relief such as, changes
in operating practices or procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in
the Company&#146;s operating expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard
is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services, deliberate
indifference to their medical needs or the lack of timely or adequate healthcare services. The
Company may also be liable, as employer, for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs
or healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The Company&#146;s contracts generally provide for
the Company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided
by the Company and its agents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains a primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. For 2002
through 2006 and 2008 with respect to the
majority of its patients, the Company purchased commercial insurance coverage, but is effectively
self-insured due to the terms of the coverage which include adjustable premiums. For 2002 through
2006 and 2008, the Company is covered by separate policies each of which contains a premium that is
retroactively adjusted, with adjustment based on actual losses. The Company&#146;s ultimate premium for
its 2002 through 2006 and 2008 policies will depend on the final incurred losses related to each of
these separate policy periods. For 2007, the Company is insured through claims-made policies
subject to per event and aggregate coverage limits. Any amounts ultimately incurred above these
coverage limits would be the responsibility of the Company. Management establishes reserves for
the estimated losses that will be incurred under these insurance policies after taking into
consideration the Company&#146;s professional liability claims department and external counsel
evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis of claim history, actuarial analysis
and coverage limits where applicable. Any adjustments resulting from the review are reflected in
current earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence, in addition to
its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported
claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by various analyses, including an actuarial
analysis, which are performed on a quarterly basis.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company&#146;s reserves for both known and incurred but not reported
claims totaled $22.0&nbsp;million. Reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number
of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next.
Furthermore, payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the
estimated liability. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and
differences between management&#146;s established reserves and actual loss payments are recognized by an
adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which the estimates are
changed or payments are made. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded increases of
approximately $6.3&nbsp;million, $10.5&nbsp;million and $4.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims
reserves as a result of adverse development on individual claims or matters. The Company&#146;s net
income (loss)&nbsp;and basic and diluted net income (loss)&nbsp;per common share were negatively impacted as
a result of this adverse development by amounts totaling $3.7&nbsp;million and $0.41 per common share,
respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, $6.2&nbsp;million and $0.66 per common share,
respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and $2.5&nbsp;million and $0.24 per common share,
respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The reserves can also be affected by changes
in the financial health of the third-party insurance carriers used by the Company. If a third
party insurance carrier fails to meet its contractual obligations under the agreement with the
Company, the Company would then be responsible for such obligations. Such changes could have a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which the changes
occur.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company has approximately $7.5&nbsp;million in accrued liabilities for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. Approximately $6.3&nbsp;million of this amount is
related to workers&#146; compensation claims, of which approximately $3.3&nbsp;million is included within the
noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is not expected to be paid within a year. The Company
is essentially self-insured for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain
individual case stop-loss levels. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims
experience and the ability to control claims. The Company accrues the estimated liability for
employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between
the incident date and the date of actual claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated
liability for workers&#146; compensation claims based on evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims and analysis of claims history. An actuarial analysis is prepared at least annually as an
additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the Company&#146;s reserve
for workers&#146; compensation claims. These estimates of self-funded insurance reserves could change
in the future based on changes in the factors discussed above. Any adjustments resulting from such
changes in estimates are reflected in current earnings. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company
recorded a decrease of approximately $0.9&nbsp;million, and increases of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million and
$0.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year other self-insurance reserves as a result of
revisions to its estimated claims experience. The Company&#146;s net income and basic and diluted net
income per common share were positively impacted as a result of revisions to its estimated
experience by amounts totaling $0.5&nbsp;million and $0.06 per common share, for the year ended December
31, 2008. The Company&#146;s net income (loss)&nbsp;and basic and diluted net income (loss)&nbsp;per common share
were negatively impacted as a result of revisions to its estimated experience by amounts totaling
$0.6&nbsp;million and $0.06 per common share, respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and
$0.1&nbsp;million and $0.01 per common share, respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.

represent amounts due primarily from governmental agencies. Accounts receivable due from the City
of Philadelphia and the Virginia Department of Corrections represents approximately 19% and 16% of
accounts receivable, less allowances, at December&nbsp;31, 2008, respectively. Deposits on
professional liability and other insurance programs represent amounts paid by the Company that are
subject to future refund from the insurance company which provides the coverage. Currently, these
balances are carried by various regulated subsidiaries of American International Group for workers
compensation and professional liability. The
Company&#146;s financial instruments are subject to the possibility of loss in carrying value as a
result of either the failure of other parties to perform according to their contractual
obligations or changes in market prices that make the instruments
less valuable. Additionally, if the financial position and/or liquidity of one of these third party insurance
carriers were to become impaired such that the third party insurer was unable to pay claims or meet
its contractual obligations to the Company, the Company could lose all or a portion of its prepaid
premiums to such carrier and/or lose the benefit of the coverage the Company has paid for, the

157&#148;), which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, including a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop fair value assumptions. It
also requires expanded disclosure about the extent to which companies measure assets and
liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value
measurements on earnings. The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets
or liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not expand the use of fair value in any new

certain acquired contingencies be recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and that
acquisition costs generally be expensed as incurred. SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R) is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R) to
have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>3. Audit Committee Investigation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;24, 2005, the Company announced that the Audit Committee had initiated an internal
investigation into certain matters related to SPP. As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company
announced that the Audit Committee had concluded its investigation and reached certain conclusions
with respect to findings of the investigation that resulted in an accrual of $3.7&nbsp;million of
aggregate refunds due to customers, including PHS, that were not charged by SPP in accordance with
the terms of the respective contracts. In circumstances where SPP&#146;s incorrect billings resulted in
PHS billing its clients incorrectly, PHS passed the applicable amount through to its clients. This
amount plus associated interest represented management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to
affected customers, based on the results of the Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. As of December
31, 2008, the Company has paid all of the accrued funds for this matter plus associated interest to
customers except for $0.4&nbsp;million which has been tendered for payment to the appropriate customers.
The ultimate amounts refunded could differ from the Company&#146;s estimates; however, actual refund
amounts to date have not differed materially from the estimated amounts. There can be no assurance
that the Company, a customer or a third-party, including a governmental entity, will not assert
that additional amounts, which may include penalties, are owed to these customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company has recorded $0.2&nbsp;million,
$0.1&nbsp;million and $5.3&nbsp;million, respectively, of Audit Committee investigation and related costs
associated with the investigation described above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>4. Restructuring Charge</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;15, 2008, the Company entered into a separation agreement and general release
with Michael Catalano which was subsequently modified on November&nbsp;7, 2008 (the &#147;Separation
Agreement&#148;). Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Michael Catalano resigned his position
as Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective December&nbsp;30, 2008. The Separation Agreement
also provided for Mr.&nbsp;Catalano&#146;s resignation from the Company and from its Board of Directors
effective January&nbsp;1, 2009, the termination of Mr.&nbsp;Catalano&#146;s previously existing employment
agreement and the release of claims by each of Mr.&nbsp;Catalano and the Company against each other.
Additionally, in connection with the restructuring, the Company elected to its Board of Directors
and amended the employment agreements of Richard Hallworth, the newly appointed President and Chief
Executive Officer, and Michael W. Taylor, its current Executive Vice President, Chief Financial
Officer and Treasurer. The Company incurred a charge related to the Separation Agreement of
approximately $2.3&nbsp;million, comprised of $1.5&nbsp;million in compensation and benefits, a $0.7
million non-cash charge related to the accelerated vesting of remaining unvested stock options and
restricted shares and the modification of the time period in which to exercise stock options and
$0.1&nbsp;million in legal and consulting fees. The non-cash charge related to the stock based
compensation is included in additional paid in capital in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate restructuring expenses were $0.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, which
related to the elimination of certain administrative and operational positions as part of a
Company-wide cost reduction process implemented in the third and fourth quarters of 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>5. Impairment of Goodwill</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the December&nbsp;31, 2006 annual impairment analysis performed by the Company as
required by SFAS No.&nbsp;142, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to its
pharmaceutical distribution services segment, SPP, of $3.0&nbsp;million to write off the carrying value
of SPP&#146;s goodwill. The impairment charge was primarily attributable to a decrease in the segment&#146;s
estimated fair value resulting from a decline in volume occurring primarily in the fourth quarter
of 2006 and from an indication of value of this segment based on a proposed independent third
party transaction. The estimated fair value of the operating segment was determined based upon
consideration of various valuation methodologies, including multiples of current earnings and
projected future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risk involved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>6. Reserve for Loss Contracts</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying potential loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for
succeeding periods if any loss contracts are identified. The Company accrues losses under its
fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. The Company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific
contract basis taking into consideration such factors as the Company&#146;s ability to terminate the
contracts, future contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs, projected
future stop-loss insurance recoveries and each contract&#146;s specific terms related to future revenue
increases as compared to increased

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">healthcare costs. The projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are estimated based
on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost increases. These estimates are
subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims experience as previously noted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might identify
contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances. Circumstances that
might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period
include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions, unanticipated
adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the utilization of outside
medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues.
Should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future period, the Company would record,
in the period in which such identification is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that
would be incurred under the contract. The identification of a loss contract in the future could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which the
reserve is recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no loss contracts identified as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;144, each of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services contracts is
a component of an entity, whose operations can be distinguished from the rest of the Company.
Therefore, when a correctional healthcare services contract terminates, by expiration or otherwise,
the contract&#146;s operations generally will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company
and classified as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the operations of such contracts, net of
applicable income taxes, have been presented as discontinued operations and prior period
consolidated statements of operations have been reclassified.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The components of income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of taxes, are as follows (in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its clients will, from time to time, have disputes over amounts billed under
the Company&#146;s contracts. The Company records a reserve for contractual allowances in
circumstances where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable. The Company&#146;s more
significantly aged receivable balances, net of reserves, are discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed more fully in Note 21, at December&nbsp;31, 2008, PHS had approximately $1.4&nbsp;million
of gross billed receivables due from a former client, Hillsborough County Sheriff&#146;s Office (&#147;HCSO&#148;)
whose contract terminated prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006. Approximately $0.7&nbsp;million of these
receivables relate to billings for costs incurred by the Company for offsite medical services and
pharmacy costs which are in excess of the Company&#146;s maximum exposure for such costs as set forth
under the Company&#146;s contract that was in effect with HCSO. The remaining receivables represent
interest accrued on the past due balances under the terms of the contract. The Company has recorded reserves totaling
approximately $0.7&nbsp;million related to these receivables. The parties are in the process of formalizing the terms of a settlement agreement (the
&#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;). Upon execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Company expects that the
net receivable balances will be collected. These receivables are
classified as current assets in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed more fully in Note 21, PHS is currently involved in two lawsuits with its former
client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;); one of the two lawsuits involves the County&#146;s
lack of payment for services rendered. PHS has approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of receivables due from
the County, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006,
the date the Company&#146;s relationship with the County was terminated. The County has refused to pay
PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS filed suit against the County in the
Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of the outstanding receivable
balances, damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment as well as
prejudgment interest. PHS believes, in the case of this lawsuit, that it has a valid and
meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the outstanding receivables, which
represent services performed under the relationship between the parties, are probable of
collection. However, although PHS believes it has valid contractual and legal arguments, an
adverse result in this lawsuit could have a negative
impact on the results of this matter and/or PHS&#146; ability to collect the outstanding receivable
amount. These receivables are classified as other noncurrent assets in the Company&#146;s consolidated
balance sheet. (see Note 11)
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in each of the cases above, the Company believes the recorded amounts represent
valid receivables which are contractually due from clients, and other than the recorded reserves,
expects full collection. However, due to the factors discussed above, there is a heightened risk
of uncollectibility of these receivables which may result in future losses in excess of such
reserves. Nevertheless, the Company intends to take all necessary and available measures in order
to collect these receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in circumstances related to the matters discussed above, or any other receivables,
could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate of contractual
adjustments in future periods. Such change, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse
affect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position in the period in which the
change occurs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was involved in a dispute with a former client whose contract term ended on
October&nbsp;31, 2007, where the client withheld approximately $2.2&nbsp;million from payments of receivables
due the Company. The Company had recorded approximately $1.5&nbsp;million of contractual allowances
which it estimated as the amount potentially due to the client related to staffing penalties under
the contract. The Company challenged the former client&#146;s ability to assess staffing penalties
under the initial term of the contract and the method of calculating the assessment. The remaining
$0.7&nbsp;million of the withheld amount due from this former client was primarily related to liquidated
damages assessed by the former client. The Company challenged this amount withheld for liquidated
damages as well as the process by which the damages were estimated by the former client. The
contract with the former client set forth specific items for which damages could be assessed and
maximum damage amounts that can be assessed for each item. The former client&#146;s assessment of
damages did not relate to items for which damages could be assessed under the terms of the contract
nor did it provide a calculation of the method used to estimate the damages for the alleged
deficiencies. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">and the former client entered into a settlement agreement under the terms of which the
outstanding receivables were satisfied with no material impact to the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was involved in a dispute with a current client over billed receivables totaling
approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, net of reserves. These receivables were invoiced to the client in the
second quarter of 2006 and represent amounts paid under a settlement between the Company and a
local healthcare provider. Under the terms of the contract between the Company and this client,
the Company is allowed to bill the client for costs incurred such as those described above. During
the second quarter of 2008, the Company and the client reached a settlement agreement under the
terms of which the client paid the Company $1.0&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>14. Banking Arrangements</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;22, 2008, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit
and Security Agreement (the &#147;Amended Credit Agreement&#148;) with CapitalSource Finance, LLC (&#147;Lender&#148;).
The Amended Credit Agreement matures on October&nbsp;31, 2011 and includes a $40.0&nbsp;million revolving
credit facility under which the Company has available standby letters of credit up to $15.0
million. The amount available to the Company for borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement is
based on the Company&#146;s collateral base as determined under the Amended Credit Agreement reduced by
the amount of each outstanding standby letter of credit. The Amended Credit Agreement is secured
by substantially all assets of the Company and its operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2008,
the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and $23.0&nbsp;million
available for borrowing, based on the Company&#146;s collateral base on that date less outstanding
standby letters of credit totaling $5.1&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company was required to maintain a
minimum outstanding borrowings balance (the &#147;Minimum Borrowing Balance&#148;) of $7.5&nbsp;million until
October&nbsp;31, 2008. Thereafter, the Amended Credit Agreement does not require a Minimum Borrowing
Balance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of eligible
receivables or (2) $40.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;Borrowing Capacity&#148;). Interest under the Amended Credit
Agreement is payable monthly at an annual rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2% subject to a minimum
LIBOR rate of 3.14%. The Company is also required to pay a monthly collateral management fee equal
to 0.042% on average borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a monthly
unused line fee equal to 0.0375% on the Borrowing Capacity less the actual average borrowings
outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement for the month and the balance of any outstanding
letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will be due and payable on October&nbsp;31,
2011. If the Amended Credit Agreement is extinguished prior to July&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company will be
required to pay an early termination fee equal to between 1.0% and 3.0% of the Borrowing Capacity
depending on the date extinguished. The Amended Credit Agreement requires a lockbox agreement
which provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. The mandatory
lockbox agreement, combined with the existence of a Material Adverse Effect (&#147;MAE&#148;) clause in the
Amended Credit Agreement, requires any outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to
be classified as a current liability, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue
No.&nbsp;95-22, <I>Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements
that Include Both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement </I>(&#147;EITF 95-22&#148;). The
MAE clause, which is a common requirement in commercial credit agreements, allows the lender to
require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s operations, business, properties, assets, liabilities, condition or prospects. The
Amended Credit Agreement does not expire or have a maturity date
within one year and any outstanding balances would only be
classified as a current liability due to the mandatory lockbox agreement and the existence of a MAE
clause in accordance with EITF 95-22. As discussed above, the Credit Agreement has a final
expiration date of October&nbsp;31, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain both a minimum level of EBITDA
of $8.0&nbsp;million and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.75 on a trailing twelve-month basis
to be measured at the end of each calendar quarter. The Amended Credit Agreement defines EBITDA as
net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, any
other non-cash non-recurring expense and loss from asset sales outside of the normal course of
business, minus gains on asset sales outside the normal course of business or other non-recurring
gains. The Amended Credit Agreement defines the fixed charge coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined
above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding debt, cash interest expense on
outstanding debt, capital expenditures, cash income taxes paid or accrued, and cash dividends paid
or accrued or declared.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was in compliance with the Amended Credit Agreement covenant requirements at
December&nbsp;31, 2008.

of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; At each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, represents

vesting periods under the Incentive Plan are discretionary and are administered by the Incentive
Stock and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;). The
exercise price of the options shall not be less than the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common

Committee determines at the time of grant, but no later than ten years from the grant date.

employees and outside directors of the Company, to provide an incentive to eligible employees and
outside directors to work to increase the value of the Company&#146;s common stock and to provide
eligible employees and outside directors with a stake in the future of the Company which
corresponds to the stake of each stockholder. There are 2,439,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock authorized under the Amended Plan. The exercise price of the options shall not be less than
the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant. Options and other
benefits expire at such times as the Committee determines at the time of grant, but no later than
10&nbsp;years from the grant date. Additionally, the Amended Plan does not permit loans to eligible
employees and outside directors for the purchase of common stock.

receives 3,000 restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock

Directors become nonforfeitable in equal annual installments over four years beginning on the
first anniversary of the date of grant. The shares granted annually to each non-employee director
become nonforfeitable in equal annual installments over three years beginning on the first
anniversary of the date of grant. The restricted shares are valued at the market value of the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized share-based
compensation cost related to restricted stock of $0.9&nbsp;million, $0.5&nbsp;million and $0.1&nbsp;million,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company instituted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 1996 pursuant to which an
aggregate of 750,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock may be sold. The Employee Stock Purchase
Plan allows eligible employees to elect to purchase shares of common stock through voluntary
automatic payroll deductions of up to 10% of the employee&#146;s annual salary. Purchases of stock
under the plan are made at the end of two six-month offering periods each year, one beginning on
January 1 and one beginning on July 1. At the end of each six-month period, the employee&#146;s
contributions during that six-month period are used to purchase shares of common stock from the
Company at 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of that
six-month period, whichever is lower. The employee may elect to discontinue participation in the
plan at any time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, there were 320,126 shares available for future employee purchases under
the above plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records compensation expense for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the
fair value of the employees&#146; purchase rights, which is estimated using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The following table shows the weighted average assumptions used to develop the fair
value estimates for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net income (loss)&nbsp;per share is measured at two levels: basic income (loss)&nbsp;per share and
diluted income (loss)&nbsp;per share. Basic income (loss)&nbsp;per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss)&nbsp;by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
income (loss)&nbsp;per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)&nbsp;by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding after considering the additional dilution related to other dilutive
securities. The Company&#146;s other dilutive securities outstanding consist of options to purchase
shares of the Company&#146;s common stock and restricted shares. The table below sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted net income (loss)&nbsp;per share as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
128, Earnings Per Share (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;128&#148;), for the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;25, 2005, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to
repurchase up to $30&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s common stock over an approximate two-year period.
Under the stock repurchase program, no shares could be repurchased directly from officers or
directors of the Company and the common stock repurchased was retired. The repurchase program did
not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. During the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company repurchased and retired a total of 865,200 common shares at an
aggregate cost of approximately $13.7&nbsp;million. As of December&nbsp;31,

Company repurchased and retired a total of 1,978,136 common shares at an aggregate cost of
approximately $29.0&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;27, 2008, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to
repurchase up to $15&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s common stock through the end of 2009. This program
is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in either the open market or
through private transactions, in accordance with SEC requirements. Under the stock repurchase
program, no shares will be purchased directly from officers or directors of the Company. The
timing, prices and sizes of purchases will depend upon prevailing stock prices, general economic
and market conditions and other considerations. Funds for the repurchase of shares are expected to
come primarily from cash provided by operating activities and also from funds on hand, including
amounts available under the Company&#146;s credit facility. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008,
the Company repurchased and retired a total of 246,900 common shares at an aggregate cost of
approximately $2.4&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) covering substantially all
employees who have completed 60 days of service. The Plan permits eligible
employees to defer and contribute to the Plan a portion of their compensation. The Company may, at
the Board&#146;s discretion, match such employee contributions to the Plan ranging from 1% to 3% of
eligible compensation, depending on the employee&#146;s years of participation. The Company made no
matching contributions in 2008, 2007 or 2006.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records a liability for reported as well as unreported professional and general
liability claims. Amounts accrued were $22.0&nbsp;million and $19.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and non-current portion of accrued
expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from the
continuous review process and differences between estimates and loss payments are recognized in
the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
Company recorded increases of approximately $6.3&nbsp;million, $10.5&nbsp;million and $4.2&nbsp;million,
respectively, to its prior year claims reserves as a result of adverse development on individual
claims or matters. The Company&#146;s net income (loss)&nbsp;and basic and diluted net income (loss)&nbsp;per
common share were negatively impacted as a result of this adverse development by amounts totaling
$3.7&nbsp;million and $0.41 per common share, respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, $6.2
million and $0.66 per common share, respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and $2.5
million and $0.24 per common share, respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. Reserves
for professional and general liability exposures are subject to fluctuations in frequency and
severity. Given the inherent degree of variability in any such estimates, the reserves reported
at December&nbsp;31, 2008 represent management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts necessary to discharge
the Company&#146;s self insured professional and general liabilities. Any adverse developments on
individual claims or matters in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
results of operations in the period in which the reserve for any adverse development is recorded.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for
all treatment costs or, in some cases, only treatment costs related to certain catastrophic
events, and/or for specific disease diagnoses illnesses. Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts do not
contain such limits. The Company attempts to compensate for the increased financial risk when
pricing contracts that do not contain individual, catastrophic or specific disease
diagnosis-related limits. However, the occurrence of severe individual cases, specific disease
diagnoses illnesses or a catastrophic event in a facility governed by a contract without such
limitations could render the contract unprofitable and could have a material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s operations. For certain of its contracts that do not contain catastrophic protection,
the Company maintains stop loss insurance from an unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among
other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in
excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual and a lifetime cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate.
Amounts reimbursable per claim under the policy are further limited to the lessor of 60% of billed
charges, the amount paid or the contracted amounts in situations where the Company has negotiated
rates with the applicable providers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Litigation and Claims</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Lysager Professional Liability Suit</I>. On November&nbsp;22, 2008, PHS received an adverse jury
verdict in the Sixth Judicial District in and for the County of Bannock, Idaho relating to a
complaint filed on December&nbsp;30, 2004 by Jamie Justice Amos Lysager and Taylor Lysager regarding
medical care provided to the plaintiff while plaintiff was incarcerated at the Pocatello Women&#146;s
Correctional Center in Bannock County, Idaho in February&nbsp;2004. The complaint alleged negligence,
deliberate indifference and intentional infliction of emotional distress by PHS in providing
medical care to plaintiff, then almost 33&nbsp;weeks pregnant, associated with the premature delivery of
plaintiff&#146;s son and sought general and special damages and reimbursement for costs and attorneys
fees incurred by plaintiff in connection with the litigation. The complaint also sought punitive
damages alleging that the actions of PHS&#146; named defendant employees met the minimum statutory
standard for jury consideration of the imposition of punitive damages against PHS, their employer.
A jury trial commenced October&nbsp;28, 2008 and ended, November&nbsp;21, 2008. The verdict was received on
November&nbsp;22, 2008 and consisted of compensatory damages of $0.1&nbsp;million and punitive damages of
$0.3&nbsp;million awarded to plaintiff, and compensatory damages of $1.3&nbsp;million and punitive damages of
$2.0&nbsp;million awarded to plaintiff&#146;s son, resulting in an aggregate award of $3.6&nbsp;million.
Additionally, the plaintiffs&#146; post-judgment, pre-appeal motions seek the imposition of costs and
attorneys fees totaling an estimated amount of $2.4&nbsp;million based on contingency fee calculations.
Post-trial motions were heard on January&nbsp;29, 2009, whereby PHS challenged the appropriateness and
amounts of the verdict awarded to the plaintiffs and vigorously opposed plaintiff&#146;s request for
attorney fees on grounds of lack of entitlement and method of
calculation. At this time the trial court has
not issued a ruling on post-trial motions. PHS has filed an appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court
seeking a reversal of the adverse verdict and judgment described above, as it believes there were
several reversible errors made by the trial court. The Company believes that its appeal has merit
and believes certain aspects of the appeal will ultimately result in a reduction of the award or a
remand to a new trial on some or all of the claims. The Company believes that the possible loss
associated with this litigation ranges from $1.5&nbsp;million to $6.0&nbsp;million. The Company has recorded
reserves equal to the $3.6&nbsp;million verdict award discussed above. In the event that the trial
court grants plaintiffs&#146; requests for attorney fees, such event could have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its financial position in the period in which the event occurs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Albert Einstein Healthcare Network v. The City of Philadelphia and Prison Health Services,
Inc. </I>On August&nbsp;1, 2005, plaintiff, Albert Einstein Healthcare Network, filed suit against the City
of Philadelphia (the &#147;City&#148;) and PHS in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, seeking
damages in the amount of $1.7&nbsp;million (plus interest) and punitive damages in the amount of $0.5
million. Plaintiff alleged that it rendered medical and/or surgical services to
prisoners/arrestees for which the defendants were obligated to pay pursuant to an implied contract
resulting from an extended course of dealing. Plaintiff alleged that defendants have failed to pay
for such services. Plaintiff has further alleged that PHS, in acting as the City&#146;s third party
administrator, fraudulently withheld payment for such services from plaintiff. On December&nbsp;27,
2005, the Court dismissed plaintiff&#146;s punitive damages claim. The City and the plaintiff then
entered into a formal settlement of the claims which involved the City paying an undisclosed,
compromised amount to the plaintiff in satisfaction of all outstanding fees for services rendered.
On March&nbsp;26, 2007, after being advised of said settlement, the Court entered an order marking this
action as &#147;Discontinued&#148; on the Court&#146;s docket. This Order effectively ended the suit against PHS
and the City, with prejudice.

denied the plaintiff&#146;s motion for class certification. The plaintiff has indicated that he will
appeal the trial court&#146;s ruling. While PHS believes that the trial court&#146;s ruling denying class
certification is sound and will be upheld on appeal, in the event the appellate court overturns the
trial court&#146;s ruling and PHS is not successful at trial, an adverse judgment could have a material
adverse affect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its results of operations. As of December
31, 2008, the Company has no reserves associated with this proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Saint Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center v. Correctional Health Services, et al</I>. On or about
February&nbsp;8, 2007, the Company&#146;s subsidiary, CHS, was served with a lawsuit by plaintiff, Saint
Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center (&#147;St. Joseph&#146;s&#148;). Plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court of
New Jersey, Law Division: Passaic County, against CHS, Barnert Hospital, County of Bergen, Bergen
County Jail, County of Essex, Essex County Jail, County of Hudson, Hudson County Jail, County of
Passaic and Passaic County Jail, &#147;John Does #1-30&#148;, &#147;ABC Corporations #1-30&#148;, &#147;XYZ Jails, Prisons
and/or Detention Centers&#148; seeking damages from CHS totaling approximately $2.5&nbsp;million. Plaintiff
claims that CHS failed to administer various contracts with respect to medical claims for the
treatment of certain patients and the payment of such claims between each of the respective
counties and jails named in the complaint and Barnert Hospital, to which St. Joseph&#146;s claims it was
an intended third-party beneficiary. On August&nbsp;15, 2007, Barnert Hospital filed for Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy protection. As a result, the court has stayed the proceedings in the lawsuit pending
resolution of the bankruptcy. CHS intends to defend itself vigorously, and maintains that it is
not responsible for any payments that may be due and owing to the plaintiff. However, a judgment
adverse to CHS could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its
results of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company has no reserves associated with this
proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Prison Health Services, Inc. v. Hillsborough County Sheriff&#146;s Office</I>. On November&nbsp;5, 2007,
PHS filed suit against the Hillsborough County Sheriff&#146;s Office (&#147;HCSO&#148;) to recover approximately
$1.4&nbsp;million dollars owed to PHS by HCSO under the now-expired health services agreement between
the parties (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) which governed the parties&#146; relationship from December&nbsp;1, 2002
through September&nbsp;30, 2005. Approximately $0.7&nbsp;million of these receivables relate to billings for
costs incurred by PHS for offsite medical services and pharmacy costs which are in excess of PHS&#146;
maximum exposure for such costs as set forth under the Agreement. The remaining receivables
represent interest accrued on the past due balances under the terms of the Agreement. On February
12, 2008, HCSO filed its answer, affirmative defenses and a two-count counterclaim against PHS. As
its basis for refusing to pay the outstanding receivables, HCSO alleges that PHS did not make
sufficient efforts to identify whether alternative third party insurance payors were responsible
for payment of the offsite medical services in question. In regard to its counterclaims, HCSO
alleges (i)&nbsp;that PHS had the obligation to indemnify HCSO in the amount of $350,000 in settlement
costs incurred by HCSO in settling a medical malpractice lawsuit, and (ii)&nbsp;PHS failed to provide
proper management, maintenance and storage of on-site medical records resulting in HCSO incurring
an estimated $250,000 costs to convert its medical records into an electronic format. On February&nbsp;19, 2009, the parties agreed to settle all claims and counterclaims in dispute.
As a result of the settlement, the court entered an order on February&nbsp;24, 2009 dismissing the
lawsuit with prejudice. The parties are in the process of formalizing the terms of the settlement through a written agreement (the
&#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;). Upon execution of the Settlement Agreement and payment of the settlement
amount, the Company will consider this matter closed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Matters involving PHS and Baltimore County, Maryland</I>. PHS is currently involved in two
lawsuits with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;) with a third lawsuit
between the parties having been determined in favor of PHS. The lawsuit which is now decided
involved the term of PHS&#146; contract with the County. PHS contended that the original term of this
contract expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005, without the County exercising the first of three, two-year
renewal options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, PHS sent a letter to the County stating its position that PHS&#146;
contract to provide services expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s failure to provide such
extension notice. The County disputed PHS&#146; contention asserting that it properly exercised the
first renewal option and that the term of the contract therefore was through June&nbsp;30, 2007, with
extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In 2005, the County and PHS agreed to have a judicial
authority interpret the contract through formal judicial proceedings, and, at the County&#146;s request,
PHS continued to provide healthcare services to the County pending the judicial resolution of the
dispute, while reserving all of its rights. Finally, during September&nbsp;2006, amid reciprocal claims
of default, both PHS and the County took individual steps to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">terminate the relationship between the parties. PHS contends that it terminated the
relationship effective September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to various breaches by the County.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the
County ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two year renewal option by sending a
faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed this ruling. On December&nbsp;6,
2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County
did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the
case to the Circuit Court to determine whether the County properly exercised the option by its
conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally decided by the Circuit Court. On May&nbsp;15,
2007, the Circuit Court, upon remand, held a hearing on the parties&#146; pending cross motions for
summary judgment. The Court issued an oral opinion at the end of the hearing indicating its
intention to rule in favor of the County&#146;s motion for summary judgment and against PHS&#146; motion for
summary judgment. On June&nbsp;6, 2007, the Court filed its order memorializing the aforementioned
ruling. In its order, the Court ruled that, by its actions, the County properly and timely
exercised the first two-year renewal option. The Company filed a Notice of Appeal and on May&nbsp;14,
2008, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals issued its ruling that the actions the County claimed
constituted an exercise of renewal were ineffective. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals
reversed the Circuit Court&#146;s ruling and directed it to grant the Company&#146;s motion for summary
judgment in the lawsuit. On June&nbsp;27, 2008, the County petitioned the Maryland Court of Appeals
(the State&#146;s highest appellate court) to review the May&nbsp;14, 2008 Court of Special Appeals decision.
By order dated August&nbsp;26, 2008, the Court of Appeals denied the County&#146;s request to review the
decision, resulting in the ruling of the Court of Special Appeals in
favor of the Company becoming final.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the remaining lawsuits revolves around the County&#146;s actions on or about May&nbsp;5,
2006, when it opened a new detention facility. PHS is of the opinion that this new facility was
not contemplated by the initial contract and represented a material increase in the staffing and
equipment required to provide services to the County. The County informed PHS that it expected PHS
to provide the same services at the new facility at no increase in price. Accordingly, on or about
July&nbsp;12, 2006, PHS filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against the County in the Circuit
Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking to have the Court declare that PHS is under no
obligation to provide personnel or services to the County at the new facility. During the pendency
of this lawsuit, PHS was providing services at the new facility under a reservation of rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, PHS has approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of receivables due from
this former client, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14,
2006. The County has refused to pay PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS
filed suit against the County in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking
collection of the outstanding receivable balances, damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit,
and unjust enrichment as well as prejudgment interest. PHS believes, in the case of this lawsuit,
that it has a valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the
outstanding receivables, which represent services performed under the relationship between the
parties, are probable of collection. However, although PHS believes it has valid contractual and
legal arguments, an adverse result in the remaining declaratory judgment action discussed above
could have a negative impact on the results of this matter and/or PHS&#146; ability to collect the
outstanding receivable amount.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Matters
Related to the Audit Committee Investigation and Shareholder Litigation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company announced that its Audit Committee had concluded
its investigation and reached certain conclusions with respect to findings of the investigation
that resulted in the recording of amounts due to SPP&#146;s customers that were not charged in
accordance with the terms of their respective contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>SEC and United States Attorney Informal Inquiries</I>. As previously reported, the Company
contacted the SEC to inform it of the existence of the internal investigation conducted by the
Audit Committee and the issues being investigated, and, since that time, the Company has cooperated
with the SEC in an informal inquiry that it is conducting as well as with the Office of the U. S.
Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee in the informal inquiry it is conducting. Both the
Audit Committee and the Company intend to continue to cooperate with those government entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholder Litigation</I>. On April&nbsp;6, 2006, plaintiffs filed the first of four similar
securities class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee against the Company and the Company&#146;s Chief Executive
Officer, at that time, and Chief

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Financial Officer. Plaintiffs&#146; allegations in these class action lawsuits are substantially
identical and generally allege on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased the
Company&#146;s common stock between September&nbsp;24, 2003 and March&nbsp;16, 2006 that, prior to the Company&#146;s
announcement of the Audit Committee investigation, the Company and/or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive
Officer, at that time, and Chief Financial Officer violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 by making false and misleading statements, or concealing
information about the Company&#146;s business, forecasts and financial performance. The complaints seek
certification as a class action, unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys&#146; fees and costs, and
other relief. By order dated August&nbsp;3, 2006, the district court consolidated the lawsuits into
one consolidated action and on October&nbsp;31, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding SPP,
Enoch E. Hartman III and Grant J. Bryson as defendants. Enoch E. Hartman III is a former employee
of the Company and SPP and Grant J. Bryson is a former employee of SPP. The amended complaint also
generally alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements concerning the Company&#146;s
business which caused the Company&#146;s securities to trade at inflated prices during the class period.
Plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of damages in the form of (i)&nbsp;restitution; (ii)&nbsp;compensatory
damages, including interest; and (iii)&nbsp;reasonable costs and expenses. Defendants moved to dismiss
the amended complaint on January&nbsp;19, 2007, and the parties completed the briefs on the motion in
May&nbsp;2007. This motion, therefore, is currently pending before the presiding judge.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Company believes that it has meritorious liability and damages defenses to the
securities class action and intends to defend it vigorously, it is unable at this time to predict
the outcome of this action or, if adversely determined, reasonably estimate a range of possible
damages. The Company maintains directors and officers liability (&#147;D&#038;O&#148;) insurance that may provide
coverage for some or all of these matters. It has given notice to its D&#038;O insurers of the claims
described above. There is risk that some or all of the claims will not be covered by such
policies; or that, even if covered, the Company&#146;s ultimate liability will exceed the available
limits of insurance. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material
adverse impact on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or
stock price.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Delaware Department of Justice Inquiry</I>. On April&nbsp;4, 2006, the Company received a letter
notifying it that the Office of the Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice is conducting
an inquiry into the indirect payment of claims by the Delaware Department of Correction to SPP
beginning in July&nbsp;2002 and ending in the Spring of 2005 for pharmaceutical services. There can be
no assurance that the Delaware Department of Justice inquiry will not result in the Company:
incurring additional investigation and related expenses; being required to make additional refunds;
incurring criminal, or civil penalties, including the imposition of fines; or being debarred from
pursuing future business in certain jurisdictions. Management of the Company is unable to predict
the effect that any such actions may have on its business, financial condition, results of
operations or stock price. The Company has cooperated and intends to continue to cooperate with
the Delaware Department of Justice during its inquiry.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Other
Matters</I></DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s business ordinarily results in actions for negligence and other
causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services. Therefore, in addition to the
matters discussed above, the Company is a party to a multitude of filed or pending legal and other
proceedings incidental to its business. An estimate of the amounts payable on existing claims for
which the liability of the Company is probable is included in accrued expenses at December&nbsp;31, 2008
and 2007. The Company is not aware of any unasserted claims that would have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Performance Bonds</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is required under certain contracts to provide a performance bond. At December
31, 2008, the Company had outstanding performance bonds totaling $9.4&nbsp;million. The performance
bonds are renewed on an annual basis. The Company has letters of credit in the amount of $3.3&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2008 that collateralize these performance bonds, reduce availability under the
Company&#146;s credit facility and limit funds available for debt service and working capital. The
Company is also dependant on the financial health of the surety companies that it relies on to
issue its performance bonds. An inability to obtain new or renew existing performance bonds could
result in limitations on the Company&#146;s ability to bid for new or renew existing contracts which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of
operations.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of May&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company has one reportable segment: correctional healthcare
services. Prior to the sale of SPP assets described above, the Company also had a reportable
segment for pharmaceutical distribution services. The correctional healthcare services segment
contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies to provide and/or administer
healthcare services to inmates of prisons and jails. The pharmaceutical distribution services
segment, prior to May&nbsp;1, 2007, contracted with federal, state and local governments and certain
private entities to distribute pharmaceuticals and certain medical supplies to inmates of
correctional facilities. The accounting policies of the segments were the same as those described
in Note 2. The Company evaluated segment performance based on each segment&#146;s gross margin without
allocation of corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense or income
tax provision (benefit).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed further in Note 7, the Company follows the guidance in SFAS No.&nbsp;144, which
requires that terminated or expired correctional healthcare service contracts be eliminated from
the ongoing operations of the Company and classified as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the
operations of such contracts, net of applicable income taxes, have been presented as discontinued
operations and prior period quarterly financial data has been reclassified.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table is a summary of the Company&#146;s unaudited quarterly statements of
operations data for 2008 and 2007 (in thousands except per share data). Earnings per share for
each quarter are computed independently of earnings per share for the year. The sum of the
quarterly earnings per share may not equal the earnings per share for the year because of: (i)
transactions affecting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in each quarter;
and (ii)&nbsp;the uneven distribution of earnings during the year.
