<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>General</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America Service Group Inc. (&#147;ASG&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;), through its
subsidiaries Prison Health Services, Inc. (&#147;PHS&#148;), EMSA Limited Partnership
(&#147;EMSA&#148;), Correctional Health Services, LLC (&#147;CHS&#148;) and Secure Pharmacy Plus,
LLC (&#147;SPP&#148;), contracts to provide managed healthcare services, including the
distribution of pharmaceuticals, to over 230 correctional facilities throughout
the United States. The Company is the leading non-governmental provider of
correctional healthcare and pharmacy services in the United States.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASG was incorporated in 1990 as a holding company for PHS. Unless the
context otherwise requires, the terms &#147;ASG&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148; refer to ASG and
its direct and indirect subsidiaries. ASG&#146;s executive offices are located at
105 Westpark Drive, Suite&nbsp;200, Brentwood, Tennessee 37027. Its telephone number
is (615)&nbsp;373-3100.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Correctional Healthcare Services</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies
to provide healthcare services to inmates of prisons and jails. The Company&#146;s
revenues from correctional healthcare services are generated primarily by
payments from governmental entities, none of which are dependent on third party
payment sources. The Company provides a wide range of on-site healthcare
programs, as well as off-site hospitalization and specialty outpatient care.
The hospitalization and specialty outpatient care is performed through
subcontract arrangements with independent doctors and local hospitals. For the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, revenues from correctional healthcare services
accounted for 92.6% of the Company&#146;s healthcare revenues from continuing
operations and discontinued operations combined.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth information regarding the Company&#146;s
correctional healthcare and pharmacy contracts.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s target correctional market consists of state prisons and
county and local jails. A prison is a facility in which an inmate is
incarcerated for an extended period of time (typically one year or longer). A
jail is a facility in which the inmate is held for a shorter period of time,
often while awaiting trial or sentencing. The higher inmate turnover in jails
requires that healthcare be provided to a much larger number of individual
inmates over time. Conversely, the costs of chronic healthcare requirements are
greater with respect to state prison contracts. State prison contracts often
cover a larger number of facilities and often have longer terms than jail
contracts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Services Provided. </I>Generally, the Company&#146;s obligation to provide medical
services to a particular inmate begins upon the inmate&#146;s booking into the
correctional facility and ends upon the inmate&#146;s release. Emphasis is placed
upon early identification of serious injuries or illnesses so that prompt and
clinically-effective treatment is commenced.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided on-site include physical and mental health
screening upon intake. Screening includes the compilation of the inmate&#146;s
health history and the identification of any current, chronic or acute
healthcare needs. After initial screening, services provided may include
regular physical and dental screening and care, psychiatric care, OB-GYN
screening and care and diagnostic testing. Hospitalization is provided off-site
at acute-care hospitals under contract to the Company. Sick call is regularly
conducted and physicians, nurse practitioners, physicians&#146; assistants and
others are also involved in the delivery of care on a regular basis. Necessary
medications are administered by nursing staff.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided off-site include specialty outpatient diagnostic
testing and care, emergency room care, surgery and hospitalization. In
addition, the Company provides administrative support services on-site, at
regional offices and at the Company&#146;s headquarters. Administrative support
services include on-site medical records and management and employee education
and licensing. Central and regional offices provide quality assurance, medical
audits, credentialing, continuing education and clinical program development
activities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Company&#146;s correctional contracts require it to staff the
facilities it serves with nurses 24 hours a day. Doctors at the facilities have
regular hours and are generally available on call. In addition, dentists,
psychiatrists and other specialists are available on a routine basis at
facilities where correctional contracts cover such services. The Company enters
into contractual arrangements with independent doctors and local hospitals with
respect to more significant off-site procedures and hospitalization. The
Company is responsible for all of the costs of these arrangements, unless the
relevant contract contains a limit on the Company&#146;s obligations in connection
with the treatment costs.

American Correctional Association (&#147;ACA&#148;) set standards for the correctional
healthcare industry and offers accreditation to facilities that meet its
standards. These standards provide specific guidance related to a service
provider&#146;s operations including administration, personnel, support services
such as hospital care, regular services such as sick call, records management
and medical and legal issues. Although accreditation is voluntary, many
contracts require compliance with NCCHC or ACA standards.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contract Provisions. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional
institutions typically fall into one of three general categories: fixed fee,
population based, or cost plus a margin. For fixed fee contracts, the
Company&#146;s revenues are based on fixed monthly amounts established in the
service contract. The Company&#146;s revenues for population based
contracts are
based either on a fixed fee adjusted using a per diem rate for variances in the
inmate population from predetermined population levels or on a per diem rate
times the average inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus
contracts, the Company&#146;s revenues are based on actual expenses incurred during
the service period plus a contractual margin.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed fee based upon
the regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other
contracts that extend beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the
future inflation rate of its costs of services when bidding and negotiating the
fixed fee for future years. The Company often bears the risk of increased or
unexpected costs, which could result in reduced profits or cause it to sustain
losses when costs are higher than projected and increased profits when costs
are lower than projected. Certain contracts also contain financial penalties
when performance or staffing criteria are not achieved.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate
a portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site
utilization risk is mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts through
aggregate pools for off-site expenses, stop loss provisions, cost plus fee
arrangements or the entire exclusion of off-site service costs. Pharmacy
expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts.
Typically under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue under the
contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as
utilization or pharmaceutical costs. While such provisions serve to mitigate
the Company&#146;s exposure to losses resulting from cost fluctuations in the
specified cost categories, the Company will still experience variances in its
margin percentage on these contracts as the additional revenue under these
contract provisions is typically equal to the additional costs incurred by the
Company. Many contracts contain termination clause provisions which allow the
Company to terminate the contract under agreed-upon notice periods. The
ability to terminate a contract serves to mitigate the Company&#146;s risk of
increasing costs of services being provided. Contracts accounting for
approximately 98% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services revenues
from continuing operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 contain one or
more of the risk-mitigating provisions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts accounting for approximately 32% of the Company&#146;s correctional
healthcare services revenues from continuing operations for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2003 contain no limits on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment
costs related to catastrophic illnesses or injuries to inmates. However, only
12% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing
operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 results from such contracts
which do not contain a termination clause provision which allows the Company to
terminate the contract under agreed-upon notice periods.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When preparing bid proposals, the Company estimates the extent of its
exposure to cost increases, severe individual cases and catastrophic events and
attempts to compensate for its exposure in the pricing of its bids. The
Company&#146;s management has experience in evaluating these risks for bidding
purposes and maintains an extensive database of historical experience.
Nonetheless, increased or unexpected costs against which the Company is not
protected could render a contract unprofitable. In an effort to manage risk of
catastrophic illness or injury of inmates under contracts that do not limit the
Company&#146;s exposure to such risk, the Company maintains stop loss insurance from
an unaffiliated insurer covering 100% of its exposure with respect to
catastrophic illnesses or injuries for annual amounts in excess of $500,000 per
inmate up to an annual per inmate cap of $2.0&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average length of a contract for services is one to three years, with
subsequent renewal options. In general, contracts may be terminated by the
governmental agency, and often by the Company as well, without cause at any
time upon proper notice. The required notice period for such contracts ranges
from one day to one year, but is typically between 30 and 90&nbsp;days.
Governmental agencies may be subject to political influences that could lead to
termination of a contract through no fault of the Company. As with other
governmental contracts, the Company&#146;s contracts are subject to adequate
budgeting and appropriation of funds by the governing legislature or
administrative body.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Administrative Systems. </I>The Company has centralized its administrative
systems in order to enhance economies of scale and to provide management with
accurate, up-to-date field data for forecasting purposes. These systems also
enable the Company to refine its bids and help the Company reduce the costs
associated with the delivery of consistent healthcare.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a utilization review system to monitor the extent
and duration of most healthcare services required by inmates on an inpatient
and outpatient basis. The current automated utilization review program is an
integral part of the services provided at each facility. The system is designed
to ensure that the medical care rendered is medically necessary and is provided
safely in a clinically appropriate setting while maintaining traditional
standards of quality of care. The system provides for determinations of medical
necessity by medical professionals through a process of pre-authorization and
concurrent review of the appropriateness of any hospital stay. The system seeks
to identify the maximum capability of on-site healthcare units to allow for a
more timely discharge from the hospital back to the correctional facility. The
utilization review staff consists of doctors and nurses who are supported by
medical directors at the regional and corporate levels.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed a variety of customized databases to facilitate
and improve operational review including (i)&nbsp;a claims management tracking
system that monitors current outpatient charges and inpatient stays, (ii)&nbsp;a
comprehensive cost review system that analyzes the Company&#146;s average costs per
inmate at each facility including pharmaceutical utilization and trend analysis
available from SPP and (iii)&nbsp;a daily operating report to manage staffing and
off-site utilization.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bid Process. </I>Contracts with governmental agencies are obtained primarily
through a competitive bidding process, which is governed by applicable state
and local statutes and ordinances. Although practices vary, typically a formal
request for proposal (&#147;RFP&#148;) is issued by the governmental agency, stating the
scope of work to be performed, length of contract, performance bonding
requirements, minimum qualifications of bidders, selection criteria and the
format to be followed in the bid or proposal. Usually, a committee appointed by
the governmental agency reviews bids and makes an award determination. The
committee may award the contract to a particular bidder or decide not to award
the contract. The committees consider a number of factors, including the
technical quality of the proposal, the bid price and the reputation of the
bidder for providing quality care. The award of a contract may be subject to
formal or informal protest by unsuccessful bidders through a governmental
appeals process. If the committee does not award a contract, the correctional
agency will continue to provide healthcare services to its inmates with its own
personnel.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain RFPs for significant contracts require the bidder to post a bid
bond or performance bond. These bonding requirements may cover one year or up
to the length of the contract and, at December&nbsp;31, 2003, generally ranged
between 10% and 100% of the annual contract fee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A successful bidder must often agree to comply with numerous of additional
requirements regarding record-keeping and accounting, non-discrimination in the
hiring of personnel, safety, safeguarding confidential information, management
qualifications, professional licensing requirements, emergency healthcare needs
of corrections employees and other matters. If a violation of the terms of an
applicable contractual or statutory provision occurs, a contractor may be
debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for specified periods of
time in the applicable location. The Company has never been debarred or
suspended in any jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Marketing. </I>The Company gathers, monitors and analyzes relevant
information on potential jail and prison systems which meet predefined new
business criteria. These criteria include facility size, location, revenue and
margin potential and exposure to risk. The Company then devotes the necessary
resources in securing new business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is the largest provider of healthcare services to
county/municipal jails and detention centers. The Company will continue to
focus its business development efforts on these facilities where stabilization
and treatment of the population is the primary

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">mission. The Company will also continue to pursue certain opportunities
at state prison systems, where in many cases, services are provided to a larger
system with a more permanent population. Due to the more permanent population
at the state prison facilities, the primary healthcare mission shifts to
disease management and treatment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a staff of sales and marketing representatives
assigned to specific projects, geographic areas or markets. In addition, the
Company uses consultants to help identify marketing opportunities, to determine
the needs of specific potential customers and to engage customers on the
Company&#146;s behalf. The Company uses paid advertising and promotion to reach
prospective clients as well as to reinforce its image with existing clients.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that the constitutional requirement to provide
healthcare to inmates, an increasing inmate population and medical Consumer
Price Index, combined with public sector budget deficits, will continue the
trend towards privatization of correctional healthcare and present
opportunities for revenue growth for the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Pharmaceutical Distribution Services</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SPP, contracts with
federal, state and local governments and certain private entities to distribute
pharmaceuticals and certain medical supplies to inmates of correctional
facilities. SPP&#146;s contracts typically cover one year with renewals upon
agreement of both parties. SPP utilizes a packaging and distribution center to
fill prescriptions and ship pharmaceuticals to over 370 sites in 33 states
covering over 235,000 inmates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPP provides clinical pharmacy services in concert with their systematic
delivery process. SPP&#146;s clinical pharmacological management adds therapeutic
value to services as well as fiscal responsibility to its clients. In
addition, SPP&#146;s medical supply service creates additional value for its
clients, as the packaging and delivery mode on certain products is specific to
the corrections environment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPP is the largest non-governmental provider of correctional pharmacy
services in the United States with 2003 revenues of approximately $76&nbsp;million,
$33&nbsp;million of which relates to services provided for Company-contracted sites,
which are eliminated in consolidation. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003,
revenues from correctional pharmacy services, excluding revenues eliminated in
consolidation, accounted for approximately 7.4% of the Company&#146;s healthcare
revenues from continuing operations and discontinued operations combined.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Risk Management</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contracts where the Company&#146;s exposure to the risk of inmates&#146;
catastrophic illness or injury is not limited, the Company maintains stop loss
insurance to cover 100% of the Company&#146;s exposure with respect to
hospitalization for annual amounts in excess of $500,000 per inmate up to an
annual per inmate cap of $2.0&nbsp;million. The Company believes this insurance
mitigates its exposure to unanticipated expenses of catastrophic
hospitalization. See &#147;Correctional Healthcare Services &#151;
Contract Provisions.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Employees and Independent Contractors</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services provided by the Company require an experienced staff of
healthcare professionals and facilities administrators. In particular, a
nursing staff with experience in correctional healthcare and specialized skills
in all necessary areas contributes significantly to the Company&#146;s ability to
provide efficient service. In addition to nurses, the Company&#146;s staff of
employees or independent contractors includes physicians, dentists,
psychologists and other healthcare professionals.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had approximately 6,350 employees,
including approximately 800 doctors and 3,050 nurses. The Company also had
under contract approximately 300 independent contractors, including physicians,
dentists, psychiatrists and psychologists. Of the Company&#146;s employees,
approximately 1,150 are represented by labor unions. The Company believes that
its employee relations are good.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental
entities is highly competitive. The Company is in direct competition with
local, regional and national correctional healthcare providers. The Company
estimates that it has approximately 9.3% of the combined privatized and
non-privatized market, based on estimates of national aggregate annual
expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its primary competitors are
Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates has approximately 7.7% of the
combined privatized and non-privatized market, and Wexford Health Sources,
Inc., which the Company estimates has approximately 2.1% of such market. As the private
market for providing correctional healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s competitors
may gain additional experience in bidding and administering correctional
healthcare contracts. In addition, new competitors, some of whom may have
extensive experience in related fields or greater financial resources than the
Company, may enter the market.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Major Contracts</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s operating revenue with respect to its correctional
healthcare operations is derived primarily from contracts with state, county
and local governmental entities. The Company&#146;s Rikers Island, New York
contract accounted for approximately 15.2% of the healthcare revenues from
continuing and discontinued operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 on
a combined basis. No other contract accounted for 10.0% or more of such
revenues during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Rikers Island Contract. </I>The Company, through its subsidiary, PHS, entered
into a contract with the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation
(&#147;HHC&#148;), effective January&nbsp;1, 2001, to provide, among other things, medical
healthcare services to inmates held by the Commissioner of the New York City
Department of Corrections. The original term of the contract was three years,
with HHC having the option to extend the term for an additional year. During
2003, HHC exercised its option to extend the contract for an additional year
through December&nbsp;31, 2004. Also during 2003, HHC assigned this contract to the
New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
(&#147;NYCDOH&#148;). For the Company&#146;s services, NYCDOH
pays the Company the cost of providing the services rendered under the contract
plus 4.25% of reimbursable costs. The Company is subject to mandatory staffing
requirements under the contract. NYCDOH is required to indemnify the Company
and its employees and independent contractors for damages for personal injuries
and/or death alleged to have been sustained by an inmate by reason of
malpractice, except where the Company&#146;s employees or independent contractors
have engaged in intentional misconduct or a criminal act. Either party may
terminate the contract without cause at any time on 12&nbsp;months&#146; notice. Either
party may terminate on ten days&#146; notice for a material breach of the contract
subject to certain cure provisions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Maryland
Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. </I>The
Company through PHS, entered into the present Maryland contract with
the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services
(&#147;DPS&#148;) on July&nbsp;1, 2000, to provide comprehensive
medical services to four regions of the Maryland prison system. The
initial term of the contract was for three years ending June&nbsp;20,
2003, with DPS having the ability to renew the contract for two
additional one year terms. The contract is presently in its first
renewal term. DPS pays PHS a flat fee per month with certain limited
cost sharing adjustments for staffing costs, primarily nurses, and
the cost of medications related to certain specific illnesses. The
contract also contains provisions that allow DPS to assess penalties
if certain staffing or performance criteria are not maintained. The
flat fee paid to PHS is increased annually based on a portion of the
consumer price index. DPS may terminate the contract by giving
notice at least ninety days before the end of a yearly term. PHS does
not have a similar ability to terminate the contract. Under
the terms of the contract the Company must maintain a performance
bond.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. </I>The Company, through
PHS, entered into a new contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Department of Corrections (&#147;DOC&#148;) on
September&nbsp;1, 2003, for a period of five years for medical
services exclusive of mental health and pharmacy. The contract covers
the entire 27 Pennsylvania prison system facilities. The DOC pays
PHS a flat rate per month, which is adjusted for changes in inmate
population levels. Under the terms of the contract, the Company is
reimbursed for the costs of the medical malpractice insurance related
to this contract and its exposure to off-site medical costs
related to this contract is limited to a specified maximum amount.
The DOC may terminate the contract on six months notice. After the
first eighteen months, PHS may terminate the contract without cause
subject to a nine month notice to the DOC.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Cautionary Statements</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All statements made by the Company that are not historical facts are based
on current expectations. These statements are forward looking in nature and
involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ
materially from current expectations. Significant factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially are the following: termination or
expiration of contracts; losses from contracts that the Company cannot
terminate; changes in performance bonding requirements; the complexity of and
potential changes in government contracting procedures; the risk of debarment
or suspension from obtaining future contracts; general business and economic
conditions; the results of ongoing litigation or investigations; and the other
risk factors described in the Company&#146;s reports filed from time to time with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain of these factors are described
in greater detail below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Client Contracts. </I>The Company&#146;s operating revenue is
derived almost exclusively from contracts with state, county and local
governmental agencies. Generally, contracts may be terminated by the
governmental agency at will and without cause upon proper notice (typically
between 30 and 90&nbsp;days). Governmental agencies may be subject to political
influences that could lead to termination of a contract through no fault of the
Company. Although the Company generally attempts to renew or renegotiate
contracts at or prior to their termination, contracts that are put out for bid
are subject to intense competition. As a result, the Company&#146;s portfolio of
contracts is subject to change. The changes in the Company&#146;s portfolio of
contracts are largely unpredictable, which creates uncertainties about the
amount of its total revenues from period to period. The Company must engage in
competitive bidding for new business to replace contracts that expire or are
terminated. The Company, therefore, has no assurance that it will be able to
replace contracts that expire or are terminated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Government Funding. </I>The Company&#146;s cash flow is subject to
the receipt of sufficient funding of, and timely payment by, the government
entities with which it contracts. If a government entity does not receive
sufficient funding to cover its obligations under a healthcare services
contract, the contract may be terminated or payment for the Company&#146;s services
could be delayed. The termination of contracts or a significant delay in
payment could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations or cash
flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Privatization of Government Services, Competition and Correctional
Population. </I>The Company&#146;s future revenue growth will depend in part on
continued privatization by state, county and local governmental agencies of
healthcare services for correctional

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">facilities. The Company believes that more than $55&nbsp;million in annualized
correctional healthcare contract revenues were newly privatized in 2003 by
governmental agencies either for the first time or as a result of the expansion
of existing contracted services to encompass additional or expanded services.
There can be no assurance that this market will continue to grow at historical
rates or at all, or that existing contracts will continue to be made available
to the private sector. Revenue growth could also be adversely affected by
material decreases in the inmate population of correctional facilities. Any of
these results could cause the Company&#146;s revenue to decline and harm its
business and operating results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Competition. </I>The business of providing correctional healthcare services
to governmental agencies is highly competitive. The Company is in direct
competition with local, regional and national correctional healthcare
providers. The Company estimates that it has approximately 9.3% of the
combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on national aggregate
annual expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its primary
competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates has
approximately 7.7% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, and
Wexford Health Sources, Inc., which the Company estimates has approximately 2.1% of such
market. As the private market for providing correctional healthcare matures,
the Company&#146;s competitors may gain additional experience in bidding and
administering correctional healthcare contracts. Competitors may use the
additional experience to underbid the Company. In addition, new competitors,
some of whom may have extensive experience in related fields or greater
financial resources than the Company, may enter the market. Increased
competition could result in a loss of contracts and market share. Any of these
results could seriously harm its business and operating results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Acquisitions. </I>The Company&#146;s expansion strategy involves both internal
growth and, as opportunities become available, acquisitions. The Company took
significant steps toward implementing this strategy with the EMSA acquisition
in January&nbsp;1999 and the acquisitions of CHS, SPP and certain assets of
Correctional Physician Services, Inc. (&#147;CPS&#148;) during 2000. The Company
previously had limited experience acquiring businesses and integrating them
into its operations and the inability to successfully integrate future
acquisitions would seriously harm the Company&#146;s business or operating revenues.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Exposure to Catastrophic Events. </I>Contracts accounting for approximately
32% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing
operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 contain no limits on the
Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to catastrophic illnesses or
injuries to inmates. However, only 12% of the Company&#146;s correctional
healthcare services revenues from continuing operations for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2003 results from such contracts which do not contain a
termination clause provision which allows the Company to terminate the contract
under agreed-upon notice periods. Although the Company attempts to compensate
for the increased financial risk when pricing contracts that do not contain
catastrophic limits and has not had any catastrophic illnesses or injuries to
inmates that exceeded its insurance coverage in the past, there can be no
assurance that the Company will not experience a catastrophic illness or injury
of a patient that exceeds its coverage in the future. The occurrence of severe
individual cases outside of those catastrophic limits could render contracts
unprofitable and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
financial condition and results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Key Personnel. </I>The success of the Company depends in large
part on the ability and experience of its senior management. The loss of
services of one or more key employees could adversely affect the Company&#146;s
business and operating results. The Company has employment contracts with
Michael Catalano, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard D.
Wright, Vice Chairman of Operations; Lawrence H. Pomeroy, Senior Vice President
and Chief Development Officer; and Michael W. Taylor, Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, as well as certain other key personnel. The Company
does not maintain key man life insurance for any member of its senior
management.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Healthcare Personnel. </I>The Company&#146;s success depends on its
ability to attract and retain highly skilled healthcare personnel. A shortage
of trained and competent employees and/or independent contractors may result in
overtime costs or the need to hire less efficient and more costly temporary
staff. Attracting qualified nurses at a reasonable cost in some markets has
been and continues to be of concern to the Company. Approximately 36% of the
Company&#146;s contracts contain financial deductions that apply when performance or
staffing criteria are not achieved. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, the
Company incurred revenue deductions related to these criteria totaling
approximately $2.1&nbsp;million, 0.4% of the Company&#146;s healthcare revenues from
continuing operations and discontinued operations combined. If the Company is
not successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified
healthcare personnel in the future, it may not be able to perform under its
contracts, which could lead to the loss of existing contracts or its ability to
gain new contracts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Corporate Exposure to Professional Liability. </I>The Company periodically
becomes involved in medical malpractice claims with the attendant risk of
substantial damage awards. The most significant source of potential liability
in this regard is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging lack of timely
or adequate healthcare services. The Company may be vicariously liable for the
negligence of healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The Company&#146;s
contracts generally provide for the Company to indemnify the governmental
agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the Company and
its agents. The Company maintains professional and general liability insurance
under which it is subject to substantial self-insurance risks resulting from
the use of large deductible policies in 2000 and 2001 and the use of adjustable
premium policies in 2002 and 2003. Management establishes reserves for the
estimated losses that will be incurred under these insurance policies using
internal and external evaluations of the merits of the

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">individual claims, analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves
assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator. The Company requires its
independent contractors to maintain professional liability insurance in amounts
deemed appropriate by management based upon the Company&#146;s claims history and
the nature and risks of its business. However, there can be no assurance that a
future claim or claims will not exceed management&#146;s loss estimates or the
limits of available insurance coverage.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the cost of malpractice and other liability insurance has risen
significantly. Adequate levels of insurance may not continue to be available
at a reasonable price. The Company is dependent on the financial health of the
insurance carriers with whom it has insurance policies. Failure to obtain
sufficient levels of professional liability insurance or a deterioration in an
insurance carrier&#146;s financial health may expose the Company to significant
losses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Credit Facility. </I>The Company&#146;s debt consists of a credit
facility dated October&nbsp;31, 2002 with CapitalSource Finance LLC. The credit
facility requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants related to
minimum levels of earnings. The financial covenants contained in the credit
facility are described in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148;
contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is dependent on the availability of borrowings pursuant to
this credit facility to meet its working capital needs, capital expenditure
requirements and other cash flow requirements during 2004. However, should the
Company fail to meet its projected results or fail to remain in compliance with
the terms of the credit facility, it may be forced to seek alternative sources
of financing in order to fund its working capital needs. No assurances can be
made that the Company can obtain alternative financing arrangements on terms
acceptable to it, or at all.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Legislative changes. </I>The Administrative Simplification Provisions of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#147;HIPAA&#148;) require
the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care
claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These
provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care
industry. HIPAA includes regulations on standards to protect the security and
privacy of health-related information. The privacy regulations will
extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable
health-related information, whether communicated electronically, on paper or
orally. The Company does not electronically file at present, but may do so in
the future, subjecting it to regulations of HIPAA.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Performance
bonds. </I>The Company is required under certain contracts to
provide a performance bond. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company has outstanding
performance bonds totaling $27.9&nbsp;million. The performance bonds are renewed
on an annual basis. The market for performance bonds was severely impacted by
certain recent corporate failures and the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001 and
continues to be impacted by general economic conditions. Consequently, the
sureties for the Company&#146;s performance bond program may require additional
collateral to issue or renew performance bonds in support of certain contracts.
The letters of credit which the Company utilizes as collateral for its
performance bonds reduce availability under the Company&#146;s credit facility and
limit funds available for debt service and working capital. The Company is
also dependant on the financial health of the surety companies that it relies
on to issue its performance bonds. An inability to obtain new or renew
existing performance bonds could result in limitations on the Company&#146;s ability
to bid for new or renew existing contracts which could have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Outcome of Florida Attorney General Investigation. </I>The Company is in
discussions with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office related to allegations
that the Company may have played an indirect role in the improper billing of
Medicaid by independent providers treating incarcerated patients (see
discussion under Item&nbsp;3. Legal Proceedings). It is possible that this
matter could result in a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial results as
a result of ongoing legal fees related to the matter, potential litigation by
the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office or a potential negotiated settlement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Other Available Information</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company files its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports
with the Securities &#038; Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). You may obtain copies of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company occupies approximately 33,528 square feet of leased office
space in Brentwood, Tennessee, where it maintains its corporate headquarters.
The Company&#146;s lease on its current headquarters expires in
April&nbsp;2009. The
Company leases additional office facilities in Franklin, Tennessee; Baltimore

Verona, New Jersey; Boise, Idaho; Indianapolis, Indiana; Richmond, Virginia;
Whitestone, New York; East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania; Montgomery,

offices to meet the local needs of future contracts awarded in new areas,
management believes that its current facilities are adequate for its existing
contracts for the foreseeable future.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Polk County matter. </I>During 2003, the Company was successful on its appeal
of a previous summary judgment granted against it in January&nbsp;2002 on an indemnification
claim by the insurer of a client. The case has now been remanded to the lower
court in accordance with the appelate court&#146;s opinion as discussed below. In
December&nbsp;1995, the Florida Association of Counties Trust (&#147;FACT&#148;), as the
insurer for the Polk County Sheriff&#146;s Office, and the Sheriff of Polk County,
Florida, brought an action against PHS in the Circuit Court, 10th Judicial
Circuit, Polk County, Florida seeking indemnification for $1.0&nbsp;million paid on
behalf of the plaintiffs for settlement of a lawsuit brought against the
Sheriff&#146;s Office. The recovery is sought for amounts paid in settlement of a
wrongful death claim brought by the estate of an inmate who died as a result of
injuries sustained from a beating from several corrections officers employed by
the Sheriff&#146;s Office. In addition, the Sheriff&#146;s Office released the Company
from liability for this claim subsequent to filing the lawsuit. The plaintiffs
contend that an indemnification provision in the contract between PHS and the
Sheriff&#146;s Office obligates the Company to indemnify the Sheriff&#146;s Office
against losses caused by its own wrongful acts. The Company was represented by
counsel provided by Reliance Insurance Company (&#147;Reliance&#148;), the Company&#146;s
insurer. In April&nbsp;2001, FACT&#146;s motion for summary judgment on the question of
liability for indemnity was denied, but on rehearing in July&nbsp;2001 the prior
denial was reversed and summary judgment was granted. In October&nbsp;2001,
Reliance filed for receivership. In January&nbsp;2002, the court entered final
judgment in favor of FACT for approximately $1.7&nbsp;million at a hearing at which
the Company was not represented, as counsel provided by Reliance had
simultaneously filed a motion to withdraw. The Company retained new counsel in
February&nbsp;2002 and obtained a reversal of the summary judgment motion on October
31, 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company&#146;s appeal bond in the
amount of $2.0&nbsp;million was released. At December&nbsp;31, 2002, the amount paid for
the appeal bond was classified as a deposit and included in prepaid expenses
and other current assets on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
case has been remanded to the trial court to determine if the actions of the
officers, for which some of them were indicted and convicted, were intentional
and whether the claims for which indemnity was sought arose out of the
provision of medical services and not the actions of the officers. The Company
believes it will be successful at the trial court level. However, in the event
that the Company is not successful at the trial court level, an adverse
judgment could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial
position and its quarterly or annual results of operations. The Company has
entered into possible settlement negotiations with the plaintiffs. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company has reserved approximately $500,000 related to
probable costs associated with this proceeding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Florida Attorney General investigation. </I>Two of the Company&#146;s operating
subsidiaries, EMSA and PHS, have been involved in a sporadic investigation by
the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office related to Medicaid reimbursement issues
from December&nbsp;1, 1998 to the present. The Company acquired EMSA in early 1999.
Although neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have ever billed Medicaid
for reimbursement, the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office has been investigating
allegations, first raised related to EMSA in 1997, that correctional healthcare
providers may have played an indirect role in the submission by independent
healthcare providers of unallowable Medicaid claims for the treatment of
inmates. The Company and its subsidiaries are cooperating fully with the
investigation. Based upon recent discussions with the Florida Attorney
General&#146;s office, the Company believes that the Florida Attorney General&#146;s
office intends to pursue a claim against the Company as part of the State&#146;s
industry-wide investigation of billing practices for inmate healthcare in
Florida.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of these ongoing discussions, the Company requested the medical
claims data from the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office that formed the basis
for such allegations. This data identifies approximately $3.25&nbsp;million of
Medicaid payments to independent providers from December&nbsp;1998 through 2003.
The Company is currently in the process of reviewing the data and comparing it
with its own and other publicly available records to determine the best course
of action to resolve this matter. Subject to further analysis of the data by
the Company and the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office, the total value of the
Medicaid payments in question to independent providers may be more or less than
$3.25&nbsp;million. Should a settlement of this matter become necessary, the
Company is not able to predict whether the amount of a settlement would be more
or less than $3.25&nbsp;million. In addition to restitution of amounts ultimately
identified as the responsibility of the Company, some portion or all of such
Medicaid payments may be subject to additional fines and penalties. The
Company will continue to cooperate with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office
to seek a prompt, appropriate resolution. It is possible that this matter
could result in a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial results as a
result of ongoing legal fees related to the matter, potential litigation by the
Florida Attorney General&#146;s office or a potential negotiated settlement. At

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">this time, the Company cannot quantify or predict the actual impact of
this matter on the Company&#146;s financial results. Given the uncertain financial
resolution of this matter, no contingent liability has been accrued at this
time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other matters. </I>In addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is
a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its business. Certain
claims, suits and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business have
been filed or are pending against the Company. An estimate of the amounts
payable on existing claims for which the liability of the Company is probable
is included in accrued expenses at December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Company is not aware
of any material unasserted claims and, based on its past experience, would not
anticipate that potential future claims would have a material adverse effect on
its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describing
the reclassification from continuing operations to discontinued operations of
contracts terminating during 2002 and 2003, the financial impact for 2003 and
2002 of adjustments to the loss contract reserve and for 2001 of charges
related to goodwill impairment, loss contracts and additional medical claims
accruals. During 2000, the Company acquired certain assets of SPP and CPS and
purchased all of the outstanding common stock of CHS in three separate purchase
transactions. During 1999, the Company purchased all of the outstanding stock
of EMSA Government Services, Inc. These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the
results of operations of the acquired entities have been included in the
Company&#146;s consolidated operating results since the respective acquisition
dates.

of receipt of revenues versus the payment for healthcare services provided
under correctional healthcare services contracts. The working capital deficit
as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, includes $365,000 and $41.1&nbsp;million,
respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the Company&#146;s revolving credit
facility. This revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October&nbsp;31,
2005; however, due to the presence of a typical material adverse effect clause
in the loan agreement combined with the existence of a mandatory lock-box
agreement, borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility have been
classified as a current liability in accordance with the guidance in the

results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are
affected by its more significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of its consolidated financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions are principally
fixed price contracts adjusted for census fluctuations. Such contracts
typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and
generally may be terminated by the correctional institution at will and without
cause upon proper notice. The contracts typically contain certain risk sharing
arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions and aggregate limits for off-site or
pharmaceutical costs. Revenues earned under contracts with correctional
institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered. Cash
received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and
recognized as income when the service is performed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into
one of three general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a
margin. For fixed fee contracts, revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly
amounts established in the service contract. Revenue for population based
contracts is calculated either as a fixed fee adjusted using a per diem rate
for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or
by a per diem rate times the average inmate population for the period of
service. For cost plus contracts, revenues are calculated based on actual
expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual margin. For contracts which include provisions limiting the Company&#146;s exposure to off-site medical services
utilization or pharmacy utilization, the Company recognizes the additional
revenue that would be due from clients based on contract to date utilization
compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs. Under
all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual
allowances for potential adjustments resulting from performance or staffing
related criteria. If
necessary, the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future
periods when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are
recognized upon delivery of the related products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and
other healthcare professionals including any related benefits and all other
direct costs of providing the managed care including the costs of professional
and general liability insurance and other self-funded insurance reserves
discussed more fully below. The cost of healthcare services provided or
contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided based in
part on estimates, including an accrual for estimated unbilled medical services
rendered through the balance sheet date. The Company estimates the accrual
for unbilled medical services using a claims payment lag methodology based upon
historical payment patterns using actual utilization data including
hospitalization, one day

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">surgeries, physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and
their corresponding costs. For contracts which have sufficient claims payment
history, an actuarial analysis is also prepared monthly by an independent
actuary to evaluate the adequacy of the accrual. The analysis takes into account historical claims experience
(including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services)
and other actuarial data.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the
Company&#146;s current estimates. The differences could be material if significant
adverse fluctuations occur in the healthcare cost structure or the Company&#146;s
future claims experience. Changes in estimates of claims resulting from such
fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims
payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the
payments are made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Loss Contracts</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is
probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. The Company performs this loss accrual analysis on a
specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as future
contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs,
projected future stop-loss insurance recoveries and each contract&#146;s specific
terms related to future revenue increases as compared to increased healthcare
costs. The projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are estimated
based on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost increases.
These estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims
experience as previously noted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of
contracts for the purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a
contract loss reserve for succeeding periods. As a result of its fourth
quarter 2001 review, the Company identified five non-cancelable contracts that,
based upon management&#146;s projections, were expected to continue to incur
negative gross margins over their remaining terms. In December&nbsp;2001, the
Company recorded a charge of $18.3&nbsp;million to establish a reserve for future
losses under these non-cancelable contracts. The five contracts covered by the
charge had expiration dates ranging from June&nbsp;30, 2002 through June&nbsp;30, 2005.
Ninety percent of the charge related to the State of Kansas Department of
Corrections (the &#147;Kansas DOC&#148;) contract, which was to expire on June&nbsp;30, 2005,
and the City of Philadelphia contract, which was renewable annually, at the
client&#146;s option, through June&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2002, the Company and the City of Philadelphia reached a mutual
agreement that the contract between PHS and the City of Philadelphia would
expire effective June&nbsp;30, 2002. As a result of the earlier than anticipated
expiration of this loss contract, the Company recorded a gain of $3.3&nbsp;million,
in the second quarter of 2002, to reduce its reserve for loss contracts. From
July&nbsp;1, 2002 to September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company provided services to the City
of Philadelphia under a transition arrangement. Subsequent to September&nbsp;30,
2002, the Company is continuing to provide healthcare services to the City of
Philadelphia under modified contract terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, the Company utilized its loss
contract reserve at a rate greater than previously anticipated due to an
unexpected increase in healthcare expenses associated with the Company&#146;s
contract to provide services to the Kansas DOC. The primary causes for the
increase in healthcare expenses in this contract were hospitalization and
outpatient costs. The Company increased its reserve for loss contracts by $4.5
million, as of June&nbsp;30, 2003, to cover estimated future losses under the Kansas
DOC contract, which was to expire in June&nbsp;2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second and third quarters of 2003, the Company participated in
active discussions with the Kansas DOC related to a proposal from the Company
that would significantly reduce the remaining length of the current contract.
In response to the proposal, the Kansas DOC solicited and received proposals
from several other vendors to provide healthcare services to the Kansas DOC.
After the Kansas DOC&#146;s evaluation of the proposals from the other vendors, in
August&nbsp;2003, the Company began discussions with Health Cost Solutions, Inc.
(&#147;HCS&#148;) and the Kansas DOC related to a proposal pursuant to which HCS would
assume the Company&#146;s performance obligation under the Kansas DOC contract.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company entered into an assignment and novation
agreement with the Kansas DOC to assign the Kansas DOC contract to HCS
effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. The Company also entered into a general assignment,
novation and assumption agreement with HCS to transfer the Kansas DOC contract
to HCS, effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. Beginning October&nbsp;1, 2003, HCS became
solely responsible for the performance of the Kansas DOC contract, and the
Company has no obligation to the Kansas DOC or to HCS related to HCS&#146;
performance of the contract. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s agreement with
HCS, the Company agreed to pay HCS net consideration of $5.6&nbsp;million in 21
monthly installments, commencing October&nbsp;31, 2003 and continuing through June
30, 2005. The net consideration of $5.6&nbsp;million is comprised of payments of
$6.5&nbsp;million to assume the Company&#146;s obligations under the Kansas DOC contract,
less $0.9&nbsp;million related to fixed assets and inventory purchased from the
Company by HCS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the financial terms of the Company&#146;s agreement with HCS, in
the third quarter of 2003, the Company reclassified $6.5&nbsp;million of its reserve
for loss contracts to accounts payable and recorded a gain of $1.7&nbsp;million, to
reduce its reserve for loss contracts. This reduction in the reserve, as well
as the second quarter increase in the reserve of $4.5&nbsp;million, are reflected as

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">components of income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of tax, in
the Company&#146;s statements of operations. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company&#146;s
payable to HCS totals $5.0&nbsp;million, with $3.3&nbsp;million classified as accounts
payable and $1.7&nbsp;million classified as a non-current liability on the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had a loss contract reserve totaling
$0.7&nbsp;million, which relates to a county contract that expires on June&nbsp;30, 2005.
Negative gross margin and overhead costs charged against the loss contract
reserve related to loss contracts, including contracts classified as
discontinued operations, totaled $4.6&nbsp;million and $6.0&nbsp;million for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The amounts charged against
the loss contract reserve during 2002 represented losses associated with all
five of the contracts that were identified during 2001. The amounts charged
against the loss contract reserve during 2003 relate only to the Kansas DOC
contract discussed above and the remaining loss contract, a county contract,
which expires on June&nbsp;30, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its quarterly review in future periods, the
Company might identify additional contracts which have become loss contracts
due to a change in circumstances. Circumstances that might change and result
in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period
include unanticipated adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure or the
utilization of outside medical services in a contract where such changes are
not offset by increased revenue. Should a contract be identified as a loss
contract in a future period, the Company would record, in the period in which
such identification is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that
would be incurred under the contract. Such a reserve could have a material
adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which it
is recorded.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-insurance Retention</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company is subject to medical malpractice
claims and lawsuits. The most significant source of potential liability in
this regard is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging lack of timely or
adequate healthcare services. The Company may also be liable, as employer, for
the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or the healthcare
professionals it engages as independent contractors. The Company&#146;s contracts
generally require it to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred
related to healthcare provided by the Company or its agents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains its primary professional
liability insurance program, principally on a claims made basis. However, the Company
assumes significant self-insurance risks resulting from the use of large
deductibles in 2000 and 2001 and the use of adjustable premium policies in 2002 and
2003. For 2002 and 2003, the Company is covered by separate policies each of
which contains a 42-month retro-premium with adjustment based on actual losses
after 42&nbsp;months. The Company&#146;s ultimate premium for its 2002 policy and its
2003 policy will depend on the final incurred losses related to each of these
separate policy periods. Reserves for estimated losses related to known claims
are provided for on an undiscounted basis using internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims, analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves assigned by the
Company&#146;s third-party administrator. Any adjustments resulting from the review
are reflected in current earnings.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a
reserve for incurred but not reported claims. The reserve for incurred but not
reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis. The Company&#146;s estimates
of this reserve are supported by an independent actuarial analysis, which is
obtained on a quarterly basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company&#146;s reserves for known and incurred but
not reported claims totaled $18.3&nbsp;million. Reserves for medical
malpractice liability fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity
of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next. Furthermore,
payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ
from the estimated liability. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from
such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss
payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice
liability in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are
made. The reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of
the third-party insurance carriers used by the Company. Changes in reserve
requirements resulting from a change in the financial health of a third-party
insurance carrier are recognized in the period in which such factor becomes
known.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Other Self-funded Insurance Reserves</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company has approximately $6.8&nbsp;million in
accrued liabilities for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. The
Company is significantly self-insured for employee health and workers&#146;
compensation claims. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on
claims experience and the ability to control claims. The Company accrues the
estimated liability for employee health insurance based on its history of
claims experience and the time lag between the incident date and the date of actual
claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated liability for workers&#146;
compensation claims based on internal and external evaluations of the merits of the
individual claims, analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves
assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator. These estimates could
change in the future.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Legal Contingencies</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to professional and general liability claims, the Company is
also subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
Such proceedings generally relate to labor, employment or contract matters.
When estimable, the Company accrues an estimate of the probable costs for the
resolution of these claims. Such estimates are developed in consultation with
outside counsel handling the Company&#146;s defense in these matters and is based
upon an estimated range of potential results, assuming a combination of
litigation and settlement strategies. Other than the potential impact of the
two Florida matters discussed above in Item&nbsp;3 &#150; Legal Proceedings, the Company
does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position. However, it is possible that future results
of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially
affected by changes in assumptions, new developments or changes in approach,
such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with such litigation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Intangible Assets and Goodwill</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;142,
<I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, </I>(&#147;SFAS 142&#148;) on January&nbsp;1, 2002, at which
time it ceased amortization of goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill
acquired is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. The Company performed its annual review as of December&nbsp;31, 2003.
Based on the results of this annual review, management has determined that
goodwill is not impaired as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. Future events could cause
the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill is
impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact
on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer
contracts acquired in acquisitions and covenants not to compete, are amortized
on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company
also assesses the impairment of its other identifiable intangibles whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the need for an
impairment review include the following:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be
impaired based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of
impairment or as a result of its annual impairment review, any impairment is
measured using a fair-value-based goodwill impairment test as required under
the provisions of SFAS 142. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could
be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be
estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or
valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of
cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value of the asset
could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation
techniques.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company determines that the carrying value of other intangible
assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the
above indicators of impairment, any impairment is measured using an estimate of
the asset&#146;s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result
from that asset, including eventual disposition.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and that goodwill associated with its acquired businesses is
impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact
on the Company&#146;s financial position and results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract
intangibles on at least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and
circumstances, including its retention rate for acquired contracts. If such
facts and circumstances indicate the current estimated life is no longer
reasonable, the Company adjusts the estimated useful life on a prospective
basis. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company revised the estimated life of
the contract intangibles, acquired in its 1999 acquisition of EMSA, from 20
years to 10&nbsp;years. The revised life impacted contract intangibles with a gross
value of $11.2&nbsp;million and, beginning October&nbsp;1, 2002, resulted in an increase
to annual amortization expense of $867,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes. </I>Under the
asset and liability method of SFAS No.&nbsp;109, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future

statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability
taking into consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future
taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary
differences. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the Company to record a valuation
allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; It further states &#147;forming a
conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is
negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.&#148; At December&nbsp;31,
2003 and December&nbsp;31, 2002, a 100% valuation allowance has been recorded equal
to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets that can be
realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s assessment of the valuation allowance could change in the
future based upon its levels of pre-tax income. Removal of the valuation
allowance in whole or in part would result in a non-cash reduction in income
tax expense during the period of removal. In addition, because a portion of the
valuation allowance as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 was established to reserve certain
deferred tax assets resulting from the exercise of employee stock options, in
accordance with SFAS 109, removal of the valuation allowance related to these
assets would result in a credit to additional paid in capital. If the
valuation allowance of $9.4&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 were to be removed
in its entirety, the credit to paid in capital would amount to approximately
$3.3&nbsp;million. To the extent no valuation allowance is established for the
Company&#146;s deferred tax assets in future periods, future financial statements
would reflect a provision for income taxes at the applicable federal and state
tax rates on income before taxes.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
noted under &#147;Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements&#148;
below, the Company is applying the discontinued operations provisions
of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, <i>Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets</i> (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;), to
all correctional healthcare service contracts that expire subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2002.
SFAS No.&nbsp;144 requires the Company to follow the income statement
presentation format described in SFAS No.&nbsp;144. The results of
operations of contracts that expire, less applicable income taxes,
are classified on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of
operations
separately from continuing operations. The presentation prescribed for
discontinued operations requires the collapsing of healthcare
revenues and expenses, as well as other specifically identifiable
costs, into the income or loss from discontinued operations. Items
such as indirect selling, general and administrative expenses or
interest expense cannot be allocated to expired contracts. The
application of the SFAS No.&nbsp;144 accounting presentation to expired
contracts has no impact on net income, earnings per share, total cash
flows or stockholders&#146; equity. As a result of the application of
SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;healthcare revenues&#148; and &#147;healthcare
expenses&#148; on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of
operations
for any period presented will only include revenues and expenses from
continuing contracts.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2002</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare revenues. </I>Healthcare revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2003 increased $115.5&nbsp;million, or 26.6%, from $433.8&nbsp;million in 2002 to $549.3
million in 2003. Healthcare revenues in 2003 included $21.5&nbsp;million of revenue
growth resulting from contracts added in 2002 through marketing activities.
The Company also added five new correctional contracts in 2003. These new
contracts in 2003 provided revenues in 2003 of $28.4&nbsp;million. Contracts in
place at December&nbsp;31, 2002 and in continuing operations at December&nbsp;31, 2003,
produced an increase in revenue of $53.5&nbsp;million during 2003 as the result of
contract renegotiations and automatic price adjustments. Correctional
contracts in place throughout the entire year during both 2003 and 2002,
including any contracts that terminated on December&nbsp;31, 2003 which are
classified as discontinued operations, experienced healthcare revenue growth of
13.0%. In addition to these increases, SPP pharmaceutical distribution revenue
increased $12.1&nbsp;million as a result of new contracts added during 2003 and
2002. As discussed in the discontinued operations section below, all
correctional healthcare service contracts that expired during 2002 and 2003
have been classified as discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare expenses. </I>Healthcare expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2003 increased $103.2&nbsp;million, or 25.3%, from $407.3&nbsp;million in 2002 to $510.5
million in 2003. Expenses related to new contracts from marketing activities
accounted for $42.2&nbsp;million of the increase. Healthcare expenses as a
percentage of revenues decreased by 0.9% in 2003 as compared to 2002. This
decrease results primarily from a reduction in staffing costs as a percentage
of revenue and revenue increases from the Company&#146;s ongoing efforts to
negotiate risk-sharing arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions and aggregate
limits for off-site or pharmaceutical costs, when renewing or negotiating
contracts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Reduction in loss contract reserve</I>. In June&nbsp;2002, the Company and the
City of Philadelphia reached a mutual agreement that the contract between PHS
and the City of Philadelphia would expire effective June&nbsp;30, 2002. As a result
of the earlier than anticipated expiration of this loss contract, the Company
performed a reassessment of its loss contract reserve requirements. This
reassessment included a review of management&#146;s projected future losses under
the then remaining three loss contracts as well as a comprehensive review of
the Company&#146;s portfolio of contracts at June&nbsp;30, 2002 for the purpose of
identifying any additional loss contracts. No new loss contracts were
identified as a result of this review. Based upon the reassessment, the
Company recorded a gain of $3.3&nbsp;million, in the second quarter of 2002, to
reduce its reserve for loss contracts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selling, general and administrative expenses. </I>Selling, general and
administrative expenses for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2003 increased
$468,000 from $14.4&nbsp;million, or 3.4% of revenues, in 2002 to $14.9&nbsp;million, or
2.7% of revenues, in 2003. The percentage of revenue decrease in selling,
general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of the increase in
healthcare revenues from continuing operations.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Depreciation and amortization. </I>Depreciation and amortization expense
decreased from $4.7&nbsp;million in 2002 to $4.2&nbsp;million in 2003 primarily as a
result of contract intangibles that became fully amortized during 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest, net. </I>Net interest expense decreased to $3.7&nbsp;million or 0.7% of
revenue in 2003 from $5.8&nbsp;million or 1.3% of revenue in 2002 primarily as a
result of a reduction in borrowings outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Charge for early retirement of debt</I>. On October&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company
entered into a new $60&nbsp;million revolving credit and term loan agreement. An
initial advance pursuant to the new agreement was used to retire all
indebtedness outstanding under the Company&#146;s previous secured credit facility.
The Company incurred a one-time charge of $726,000 in the fourth quarter of
2002 for early debt retirement. The charge represents the write-off of the
remaining unamortized loan arrangement fees related to the Company&#146;s previous
secured credit facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income tax provision. </I>The provision for income taxes for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2003 was $881,000 or 0.1% of revenue, as compared with $331,000
or 0.1% of revenue in 2002. These amounts represent state income taxes paid
and are significantly lower than the Company&#146;s statutory tax rate due to the
valuation allowance that has been applied to the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income from continuing operations. </I>Income from continuing operations for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 was $15.1&nbsp;million, or 2.8% of revenue, as
compared with $3.7&nbsp;million, or 0.8% of revenue in 2002. The increase is due to
the factors discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of taxes</I>. The loss from
discontinued operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 was $3.2&nbsp;million,
or 0.6% of revenue, as compared with income from discontinued operations of
$8.2&nbsp;million, or 1.9% of revenue in 2002. Income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued
operations represents the operating results of the Company&#146;s contracts that
expired during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002. The classification
of these expired contracts is the result of the Company&#146;s adoption of SFAS No.
144 effective January&nbsp;1, 2002. See Notes 2 and 5 of the Company&#146;s consolidated
financial statements for further discussion of SFAS No.&nbsp;144.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately $3.7&nbsp;million and $2.4&nbsp;million in negative operating margin
related to the Company&#146;s loss contracts classified as discontinued operations
was charged against the loss contract reserve during the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter of 2003, the Company utilized its loss contract
reserve at a rate greater than previously anticipated primarily as the result
of an unexpected increase in healthcare expenses associated with the Company&#146;s
contract to provide services to the Kansas DOC. The primary causes for the
increase in healthcare expenses in this contract were hospitalization and
outpatient costs. As result of the utilization increase, the Company
increased its reserve for loss contracts by $4.5&nbsp;million, as of June&nbsp;30, 2003,
to cover estimated future losses under the Kansas DOC contract which was to
expire in June&nbsp;2005. This increase in the reserve for loss
contracts has been
included in income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company entered into an assignment and novation
agreement with the Kansas DOC to assign the Kansas DOC contract to HCS
effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. The Company also entered into a general assignment,
novation and assumption agreement with HCS to transfer the Kansas DOC contract
to HCS, effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. Beginning October&nbsp;1, 2003, HCS became
solely responsible for the performance of the Kansas DOC contract, and the
Company has no obligation to the Kansas DOC or to HCS related to HCS&#146;
performance of the contract. As a result of the financial terms of the
Company&#146;s agreement with HCS, the Company reclassified $6.5&nbsp;million of its
reserve for loss contracts to accounts payable and recorded a gain of $1.7
million, in the third quarter of 2003, to reduce its reserve for loss
contracts. This decrease in the reserve for loss contracts has been included
in income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Net income attributable to common shares. </I>Net income attributable to
common shares for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 was $11.9&nbsp;million or 2.2% of
revenue, as compared with net income attributable to common shares of $11.9
million, or 2.7% of revenue, in 2002.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2001</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare revenues. </I>Healthcare revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2002 increased $17.7&nbsp;million, or 4.3%, from $416.1&nbsp;million in 2001 to $433.8
million in 2002. Healthcare revenues in 2002 included $27.8&nbsp;million of revenue
growth resulting from new contracts added in 2002 and 2001. Contracts in place
at December&nbsp;31, 2001 and in continuing operations at December&nbsp;31, 2003,
produced an increase in revenue of $39.9&nbsp;million during 2002 as the result of
contract renegotiations and automatic price adjustments. Correctional
contracts in place throughout the entire year during both 2002 and 2001,
including any contracts that terminated on December&nbsp;31, 2002 or during 2003
which are classified as discontinued operations, experienced healthcare revenue
growth of 11.7%. These revenue increases were offset by a $15.1&nbsp;million
reduction in SPP pharmaceutical distribution revenue. The decrease in SPP
pharmaceutical distribution revenue was the result of the loss of two
pharmaceutical distribution customers in the third quarter of 2001. The
Company&#146;s 2002 revenues were also negatively impacted by the loss of 21
correctional contracts that expired during 2001. The loss of these contracts
resulted in a decrease in revenues of approximately $34.9&nbsp;million from 2001 to
2002. As discussed in the discontinued operations section below, all contracts
that expired during 2002 have been classified as discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare expenses. </I>Healthcare expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2002 increased $7.2&nbsp;million, or 1.8%, from $400.1&nbsp;million in 2001 to $407.3
million in 2002. Expenses related to new contracts from marketing activities
accounted for $23.3&nbsp;million of the increase. This increase was partially
offset by the elimination of healthcare expenses related to contracts that
expired during 2001. Healthcare expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased
by 2.3% in 2002 as compared to 2001. During 2001, the Company recorded a
charge of $6.0&nbsp;million to increase its reserve for medical claims. This charge
was primarily the result of updated second quarter of 2001 information showing
actual utilization rates and cost data for inpatient and outpatient services
were higher than the historical levels on which the Company&#146;s reserve had been
based. Approximately $2.7&nbsp;million of this amount is included in discontinued
operations for 2001 as it relates to contracts that expired during 2002 and
2003. The remaining $3.3&nbsp;million of the charge has been included in healthcare
expenses for 2001. Exclusive of this amount, healthcare expenses for 2001 were
95.4% of revenues compared to 93.9% of revenues for 2002. This 1.5% decrease
results primarily from a decrease in pharmacy related expenses and
approximately $2.4&nbsp;million in negative operating margin related to the
Company&#146;s loss contracts that was charged against the loss contract reserve
during 2002. The Company&#146;s ongoing efforts when renewing or negotiating
contracts to negotiate risk-sharing arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions
and aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical costs, also contributed to
the reduction of healthcare expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Reduction in loss contract reserve</I>. In June&nbsp;2002, the Company and the
City of Philadelphia reached a mutual agreement that the contract between PHS
and the City of Philadelphia would expire effective June&nbsp;30, 2002. As a
result of the earlier than anticipated expiration of this loss contract, the
Company performed a reassessment of its loss contract reserve requirements.
This reassessment included a review of management&#146;s projected future losses
under the then remaining three loss contracts as well as a comprehensive
review of the Company&#146;s portfolio of contracts at June&nbsp;30, 2002 for the
purpose of identifying any additional loss contracts. No new loss contracts
were identified as a result of this review. Based upon the reassessment, the
Company recorded a gain of $3.3&nbsp;million, in the second quarter of 2002, to
reduce its reserve for loss contracts. From July&nbsp;1, 2002 to September&nbsp;30,
2002, the Company provided services to the City of Philadelphia under a
transition arrangement. Subsequent to September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company is
continuing to provide healthcare services to the City of Philadelphia under
modified contract terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Charge for loss contracts. </I>In December&nbsp;2001, the Company recorded a
charge of $18.3&nbsp;million to establish a reserve for future losses under certain
non-cancelable contracts. During 2001, the Company completed a comprehensive
review of its portfolio of contracts for the purpose of identifying loss
contracts and developing a contract loss reserve for succeeding years. As a
result of this review, the Company identified five non-cancelable contracts
with combined 2001 annual revenues of $59.7&nbsp;million and negative gross margin
of $4.7&nbsp;million. Based upon management&#146;s projections, these contracts were
expected to continue to incur negative gross margin over their remaining terms.
The five contracts covered by the charge had expiration dates ranging from
June&nbsp;30, 2002 through June&nbsp;30, 2005. Ninety percent of the charge related to
the Kansas DOC contract, which was to expire June&nbsp;30, 2005, and the City of
Philadelphia contract, which was renewable annually, at the client&#146;s option,
through June&nbsp;30, 2004. The remaining ten percent of the charge related to the
State of Maine contract, which was due to expire June&nbsp;30, 2002, a county
contract that renewed on more favorable terms on August&nbsp;15, 2002 and a county
contract that expires on June&nbsp;30, 2005. The Kansas DOC contract and the State
of Maine contracts were both terminated during 2003, and as a result $8.8
million of the original $18.3&nbsp;million charge for loss contracts is now
classified as discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selling, general and administrative expenses. </I>Selling, general and
administrative expenses for year ending December&nbsp;31, 2002 decreased $4.7
million from $19.1&nbsp;million, or 4.6% of revenues, in 2001 to $14.4&nbsp;million, or
3.3% of revenues, in 2002. Included in selling, general and administrative
expenses for 2001 were charges to increase the Company&#146;s legal reserves by $1.9
million. These charges were primarily required to reflect the Company&#146;s
increased exposure to certain outstanding cases previously covered by an
insurance carrier that is now in liquidation. The percentage of revenue
decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses excluding these
charges is primarily the result of overhead reductions implemented by the
Company in the second half of 2001 and

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">approximately $1.0&nbsp;million in overhead costs associated with the Company&#146;s
five loss contracts that was charged against the loss contract reserve.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Depreciation and amortization. </I>Depreciation and amortization expense
decreased from $7.1&nbsp;million in 2001 to $4.7&nbsp;million in 2002. This overall
decrease is primarily the result of an increase in amortization of $434,000 in
the second half of 2002, due to an adjustment of the estimated life for a
portion of the Company&#146;s contract intangibles from 20&nbsp;years to 10&nbsp;years, offset
by the cessation of amortization of goodwill as a result of the Company&#146;s
adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;142, <I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>, effective
January&nbsp;1, 2002. Under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is
required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Amortization expense
related to goodwill totaled approximately $2.8&nbsp;million for 2001.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Strategic initiative and severance expenses. </I>During 2001, the Company
incurred certain strategic initiative expenses associated with an initiative
that was discontinued in the third quarter of 2001. Additionally, during the
third quarter of 2001, the Company incurred severance expenses related to
staffing reductions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest, net. </I>Net interest expense increased to $5.8&nbsp;million or 1.3% of
revenue in 2002 from $5.7&nbsp;million or 1.4% of revenue in 2001.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Charge for early retirement of debt</I>. On October&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company
entered into a new $60&nbsp;million revolving credit and term loan agreement. An
initial advance pursuant to the new agreement was used to retire all
indebtedness outstanding under the Company&#146;s previous secured credit facility.
The Company incurred a one-time charge of $726,000 in the fourth quarter of
2002 for early debt retirement. The charge represents the write-off of the
remaining unamortized loan arrangement fees related to the Company&#146;s previous
secured credit facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income tax provision (benefit). </I>The provision for income taxes for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 was $331,000 or 0.1% of revenue, as compared with
a benefit of $1.9&nbsp;million or 0.4% of revenue in 2001. These amounts represent
state income taxes paid and are significantly lower than the Company&#146;s
statutory tax rate due to the valuation allowance that has been applied to the
Company&#146;s deferred tax assets.

revenue, as compared with a loss from continuing operations of $26.1&nbsp;million,
or 6.3% of revenue in 2001. The increase is due to the factors
discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of taxes</I>. Income from
discontinued operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 was $8.2&nbsp;million,

$18.7&nbsp;million, or 4.5% of revenue in 2001. Income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued
operations represents the operating results of the Company&#146;s contracts that
expired during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002. The classification
of these expired contracts is the result of the Company&#146;s adoption of SFAS No.
144 effective January&nbsp;1, 2002. See Notes 2 and 5 of the Company&#146;s consolidated
financial statements for further discussion of SFAS No.&nbsp;144.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately $2.4&nbsp;million in negative operating margin related to the
Company&#146;s loss contracts classified as discontinued operations was charged
against the loss contract reserve during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002. The
loss from discontinued operations for 2001 includes a charge for loss contracts
of $8.8&nbsp;million related to the Kansas DOC contract and the State of Maine
contracts both of which were terminated during 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss from discontinued operations for 2001 also includes a non-cash
impairment charge of $13.2&nbsp;million to reduce goodwill. During the second

to provide healthcare services for the Eastern Region of the Pennsylvania
Department of Corrections upon the expiration of the Company&#146;s contract on
December&nbsp;31, 2002. The Company also determined that it would cease operations
under the contract with the Yonkers Region of the New York Department of
Correctional Services upon the expiration of the Company&#146;s contract on May&nbsp;31,
2002 as the healthcare services were to be assumed by the client. Each of
these contracts was acquired in the Company&#146;s acquisition of certain assets of
CPS in 2000. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a non-cash
impairment charge of $13.2&nbsp;million representing the amount by which goodwill
related to these contracts exceeded the contracts&#146; fair value.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Liquidity and Capital Resources</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company generated net income attributable to common shares of $11.9
million for each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002. The Company
had stockholders&#146; equity of $39.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003 as compared to
$14.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2002. The Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalents
decreased to $1.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003 from $3.8&nbsp;million at December
31, 2002, a decrease of $2.6&nbsp;million. The decrease in cash was primarily the
result of payments made to reduce borrowings outstanding under the Company&#146;s
credit facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows from operating activities represents the net income plus
depreciation and amortization, changes in various components of working capital
and adjustments for various non-cash charges, such as increases or reductions
in the reserve for loss contracts. Cash flows from operating activities
increased to $22.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 from $9.3
million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002. The increase in cash flows from
operating activities of $13.1&nbsp;million was due to increased gross margins and a
reduction in interest expense, resulting from reductions in debt outstanding
and the refinancing of the Company&#146;s revolving credit facility in October&nbsp;2002.
Additionally, in 2003 the Company recorded a net increase to its reserve for
loss contracts of $2.8&nbsp;million as compared to a reduction of the reserve for
loss contracts of $3.3&nbsp;million in 2002. During 2003 the Company reduced
accounts receivable by $11.2&nbsp;million as compared to an increase of $8.0&nbsp;million
during 2002. The reduction in accounts receivable was the combined result of
improved payments terms on new contracts and a reduction in days sales
outstanding due to collection efforts. During the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2003, the Company also reduced other current assets by $1.0&nbsp;million as compared
to an increase of $4.0&nbsp;million during 2002. The reduction in other current
assets was primarily the result of the cancelation of a $2.0&nbsp;million appeal
bond related to the litigation discussed above in Item&nbsp;3. <I>Legal Proceedings</I>.
These favorable changes in working capital were partially offset by a decrease
of $12.8&nbsp;million in accounts payable during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 as
compared to a $9.7&nbsp;million increase in accounts payable during 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2003 were $23.4&nbsp;million and include net payments totaling $42.4&nbsp;million to
reduce the amount of debt outstanding from $46.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2002
to $3.6&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003. Also included in cash flows used in
financing activities during 2003 were cash receipts of $11.6&nbsp;million resulting
from stock option exercises and the issuance of common stock under an employee
stock purchase plan, $6.3&nbsp;million resulting from the elimination of restricted
cash balances and $1.3&nbsp;million in proceeds from stockholders&#146; notes receivable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Credit Facility</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating
activities and borrowings under its credit facility. On October&nbsp;31, 2002, the
Company entered into a new credit facility with CapitalSource Finance LLC (the
&#147;CapitalSource Credit Facility&#148;). The CapitalSource Credit Facility matures on
October&nbsp;31, 2005 and includes both a $55.0&nbsp;million revolving credit facility
(the &#147;Revolver&#148;) and a $5.0&nbsp;million term loan (the &#147;Term Loan&#148;). Proceeds from
the CapitalSource Credit Facility were used to repay the borrowings outstanding
pursuant to the Company&#146;s previously existing revolving credit facility (the
&#147;Prior Credit Facility&#148;) at which time the Company wrote-off $726,000 of
deferred loan costs related to the Prior Credit Facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets
of the Company and its operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the
Company had borrowings outstanding under the Revolver totaling $365,000 and
$32.6&nbsp;million available for additional borrowing, based on the Company&#146;s
collateral base and outstanding standby letters of credit on that
date. The balance outstanding on the Company&#146;s Revolver is
subject to intra-month fluctuations based on the timing of receivables
collections and the payments of current liabilities. On average
during 2003, the difference between the lowest and highest daily
outstanding Revolver balances within each month was
approximately $14 million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2003, the Company and CapitalSource Finance LLC entered into an
amendment to the CapitalSource Credit Facility. Under the terms of the
amendment, the Company may have standby letters of credit issued under the loan
agreement in amounts up to $10.0&nbsp;million. The amount available to the Company
for borrowings under the CapitalSource Credit Facility is reduced by the amount
of each outstanding standby letter of credit. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the
Company had outstanding standby letters of credit totaling $4.0&nbsp;million, which
were used to collateralize performance bonds. Prior to this amendment, the
performance bonds were collateralized by restricted cash. As a result of this
amendment, the Company is no longer required to maintain the restricted cash
balances that were previously used as collateral for the performance bonds.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Revolver are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of
eligible receivables (as defined) or (2) $55.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;Revolver
Capacity&#148;). Interest under the Revolver is payable monthly at the greater of
5.75% or the Citibank N.A. prime rate plus 1.0%. The Company is also required
to pay a monthly collateral management fee, equal to an annual rate of 1.38%,
on average borrowings outstanding under the Revolver. Additionally, the
Company is required to pay a monthly letter of credit fee equal to an annual
rate of 3.5% on the outstanding balance of letters of credit issued pursuant to
the Revolver.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the CapitalSource Credit Facility, the Company is
required to pay a monthly unused line fee equal to an annual rate of 0.6% on
the Revolver Capacity less the actual average borrowings outstanding under the
Revolver for the month, and the balance of any outstanding letters of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All amounts outstanding under the Revolver will be due and payable on
October&nbsp;31, 2005. If the Revolver is extinguished prior to July&nbsp;1, 2005, the
Company will be required to pay an early termination fee equal to 1.0% of the
Revolver Capacity. In connection with the Revolver, the CapitalSource Credit
Facility requires a lockbox agreement, which provides for all cash receipts to
be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. This agreement, combined with
the existence of a Material Adverse Effect (&#147;MAE&#148;) clause in the CapitalSource
Credit Facility, requires the Revolver to be classified as a current liability,
in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue (&#147;EITF&#148;) No.&nbsp;95-22, <I>Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings
Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements that Include Both a Subjective
Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement</I>. The MAE clause, which is a
typical requirement in commercial credit agreements, allows the lender to
require the loan to become due if the lender determines there has been a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations, business, properties,
assets, liabilities, condition or prospects. The classification of the Revolver
as a current liability is a result only of the combination of the two
aforementioned factors: the lockbox agreements and the MAE clause. The
Revolver does not expire or have a maturity date within one year. As discussed
above, the Revolver has a final expiration date of October&nbsp;31, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2003, $3.2&nbsp;million was outstanding under the Term Loan.
The Term Loan requires monthly principal payments of $138,889 through its
maturity on October&nbsp;31, 2005. Interest under the Term Loan is payable monthly
at the greater of 8.5% or the Citibank, N.A. prime rate plus 3.5%. Upon
expiration of the Term Loan, the Company will be required to pay a fee of
$100,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility requires the Company to achieve a
minimum level of EBITDA of $3.0&nbsp;million on a rolling three-month measurement
period. The CapitalSource Credit Facility defines EBITDA as net income plus
interest expense, income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, any
other non-cash non-recurring expense and loss from asset sales outside of the
normal course of business, minus gains on asset sales outside the normal course
of business, non-recurring gains, and charges against the Company&#146;s loss
contract reserve.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain a
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 on a rolling three-month basis. The
CapitalSource Credit Facility defines the fixed charge coverage ratio as
EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal payments on
outstanding debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital
expenditures, cash income taxes paid or accrued, and cash dividends paid or
accrued or declared. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a
minimum fixed charge ratio of 1.75 calculated using the most recent
twelve-month period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility also contains restrictions on the
Company with respect to certain types of transactions, including acquisition of
the Company&#146;s own stock, payment of dividends, indebtedness and sales or
transfers of assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is dependent on the availability of borrowings pursuant to the
CapitalSource Credit Facility to meet its working capital needs, capital
expenditure requirements and other cash flow requirements during 2004.
Management believes that the Company can comply with the terms of the
CapitalSource Credit Facility and meet its expected obligations throughout
2004. However, should the Company fail to meet its projected results, it may
be forced to seek additional or alternative sources of financing in order to
fund its working capital needs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other Financing Transactions</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;5, 2001, the Company completed the conversion of 125,000
shares of Series&nbsp;A Convertible Preferred Stock, having an aggregate liquidation
preference of $12.5&nbsp;million, into 1,322,751 shares of common stock. The
Company registered the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the
preferred stock and warrants to purchase an additional 135,000 shares of common
stock. In July&nbsp;2002, the warrant holder exercised 67,500 of these warrants
using a net exercise provision contained in the warrant agreement. The warrant
holder exercised the remaining warrants in May&nbsp;2003 using a net exercise
provision contained in the warrant agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;21, 2002, the Company completed a private placement of 480,000
shares of newly issued common stock at $9.50 per share, realizing proceeds of
approximately $4.0&nbsp;million, net of issuance costs. The net proceeds were used
to repay borrowings

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amounts included in the table above do not include future cash
payments for interest. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company was contingently
liable for $27.9&nbsp;million of performance bonds. The performance bonds are
collateralized by the standby letters of credit.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Off
Balance Sheet Transactions</I>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December 31, 2003, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet
financing transactions or arrangements.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Inflation</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Company&#146;s contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed
base fee based upon changes in the regional medical care component of the
Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts that extend beyond one year, the
Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of its cost of
services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. If the
rate of inflation exceeds the levels projected, the excess costs will be
absorbed by the Company. Conversely, the Company will benefit should the actual
rate of inflation fall below the estimate used in the bidding and negotiation
process.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;1998, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;133, <I>Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities</I>, as amended in June&nbsp;2000 by SFAS No.&nbsp;138,
<I>Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities</I>,
which requires the Company to recognize all derivatives as assets or
liabilities measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized
through either earnings or other comprehensive income dependent upon the
effectiveness of the hedge instrument. Upon adoption of the provisions of SFAS
No.&nbsp;133, as amended, effective January&nbsp;1, 2001, the Company maintained three
interest collar agreements for a notional amount of $24.0&nbsp;million. Two of the
collars expired during 2002. The third collar was terminated during 2002 at a
cost of approximately $165,000. Consistent with the transition
provisions of
SFAS No.&nbsp;133, the Company recognized in other comprehensive income a cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle equal to the estimated fair value of
the derivative instruments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;142, <I>Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, </I>which addresses the accounting for
goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS No.
142 requires that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized, and
that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be
amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. The Company
adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;142 effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, at which time the amortization
of the Company&#146;s existing goodwill ceased. Other than the effect on net income
of not amortizing goodwill, the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;142 had no effect on the
Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position. Amortization expense
related to goodwill for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2001 was approximately $2.9
million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
August&nbsp;2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. </I>SFAS No.&nbsp;144 expanded the scope
of financial accounting and reporting of discontinued operations previously
addressed in APB No.&nbsp;30 to require that all components of an entity that have
either been disposed of (by sale, by abandonment, or in a distribution to
owners) or are held for sale and whose operations and cash flows can be clearly
distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest
of the entity, should be presented as discontinued operations. The provisions
for presenting the components of an entity as discontinued operations are
effective only for disposal activities after the effective date of SFAS No.
144. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 effective January&nbsp;1,
2002. Pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;144, each of the Company&#146;s contracts is a component
of an entity, whose operations can be distinguished from the rest of the
Company. Therefore, when a contract terminates, by expiration or otherwise,
the contract&#146;s operations generally will be eliminated from the ongoing
operations of the Company and classified as discontinued operations.
Accordingly, the operations of such contracts, that expired during 2002 and
2003, net of applicable income taxes, have been presented as discontinued
operations and prior period Consolidated Statements of Operations have been
reclassified. See Note 5 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements
for further discussion of discontinued operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November&nbsp;2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;45,
<I>Guarantor&#146;s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others </I>(&#147;FIN 45&#148;). This interpretation
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and
annual financial statements concerning its obligations under certain guarantees
that it has issued. It also clarifies (for guarantees issued after January&nbsp;1,
2003) that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The Company adopted FIN 45 effective January&nbsp;1, 2003.
For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company did not have any guarantees
that required recognition as a liability.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, <I>Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities </I>(&#147;FIN 46&#148;), which requires the consolidation of
certain variable interest entities, as defined by FIN 46. FIN 46 requires an
assessment of contractual arrangements to determine if they represent interests
in variable interest entities. Unless they meet the definition of a special
purpose entity, variable interest entities will be subject to the consolidation
provisions of FIN 46 beginning in fiscal periods ending after March&nbsp;15, 2004.
Additionally, disclosures are required currently if the Company expects to
consolidate any variable interest entities in the future. The Company is
currently evaluating the consolidation requirements of FIN 46. At this time,
the Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will impact
the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position or results of operation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
May&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;150, <I>Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity</I> (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;150&#148;).
SFAS No.&nbsp;150 requires that an issuer classify certain financial instruments
within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Effective
July&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;150. The adoption of this standard
did not impact the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated
financial statements of the Company due to adverse changes in financial market
prices and rates. The Company&#146;s exposure to market risk is primarily related
to changes in the variable interest rate under the CapitalSource Credit
Facility. The CapitalSource Credit Facility carries an interest rate based on
the Citibank N.A. prime rate, subject to a minimum stated interest rate;
therefore the Company&#146;s cash flow may be affected by changes in the prime rate.
For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, a hypothetical 10% change in the
underlying interest rate would have had no effect on interest expense paid
under the Credit Facility, as the resulting interest rate would have remained
below the minimum stated interest rate. Interest expense represents 0.7% and
1.3% of the Company&#146;s revenues, respectively, for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2003 and 2002. Debt of $3.6&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003 represents 9.2% of
the Company&#146;s total liabilities and stockholders&#146; equity.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure controls and procedures are the Company&#146;s controls and other
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company evaluated under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule
13a-14 and Rule&nbsp;13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material
information that is required to be included in the Company&#146;s periodic SEC
filings. There have been no changes in the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting during the period covered by this annual report that
materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company&#146;s
internal control over financial reporting.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Board of Directors and Stockholders<BR>
America Service Group Inc.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America
Service Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders&#146; equity
(deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
referenced at Item&nbsp;15(a). These financial statements and schedule are
the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of America
Service Group Inc. and subsidiaries at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects the information set forth therein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January&nbsp;1, 2002, America Service Group Inc. changed its method of accounting
for goodwill. In addition, as described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, America Service Group Inc.
changed its method of accounting for certain dispositions of assets and
terminations and expirations of contracts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January&nbsp;1, 2001, America Service Group Inc. changed its method of accounting
for derivative financial instruments.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2003</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>1. Description of Business</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America Service Group Inc. (&#147;ASG&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) and its consolidated
subsidiaries provide managed healthcare services to correctional facilities
under contracts with state and local governments, certain private entities and
a medical facility operated by the Veterans Administration. The health status
of inmates impacts the results of operations under such contractual
arrangements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Principles of Consolidation</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Prison Health Services, Inc. (&#147;PHS&#148;), EMSA
Limited Partnership, Correctional Health Services, LLC (&#147;CHS&#148;) and Secure
Pharmacy Plus, LLC (&#147;SPP&#148;). All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Use of Estimates</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Some of the more significant areas
requiring estimates in the financial statements include the recording of the
accruals of unbilled medical services calculated based upon a claims payment
lag methodology, loss contract reserves, legal contingencies and employee
health, workers&#146; compensation and professional and general liability claims
for which the Company is substantially self-insured. Estimates change as new
events occur, more experience is acquired, or additional information is
obtained. A change in an estimate is accounted for in the period of change
(see section entitled <I>Contracts and Other Intangibles </I>of this Note and Note
5).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying amounts of the Company&#146;s financial instruments reported in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisting of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and long-term debt,
approximate their fair values.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company engages principally in fixed price contracts with
correctional institutions adjusted for census fluctuations. Such contracts
typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options
and generally may be terminated by the correctional institution at will and
without cause upon proper notice. Revenues earned under contracts with
correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are
rendered. Cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred
revenue and recognized as income when the service is performed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall
into one of three general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost
plus a margin. For fixed fee contracts, revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly
amounts established in the service contract. Revenue for population based
contracts is calculated either as a fixed fee adjusted using a per diem rate
for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or
by a per diem rate times the average inmate population for the period of
service. For cost plus contracts, revenues are calculated based on actual
expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual margin. For contracts which
include provisions limiting the Company&#146;s exposure to off-site medical
services utilization or pharmacy utilization, the Company recognizes the
additional revenue that would be due from clients based on contract to date
utilization compared to the corresponding pro rata

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">contractual limit for such costs. Under
all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual
allowances for potential adjustments resulting from performance or staffing
related criteria. If necessary, the Company revises its
estimates for such adjustments in future periods when the actual amount of the
adjustment is determined.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are
recognized upon delivery of the related products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and
other healthcare professionals, including any related benefits, and all other
direct costs of providing the managed care including the costs of
professional and general liability insurance and other self-funded
insurance reserves discussed more fully below. The cost of healthcare services
provided or contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are
provided based in part on estimates, including an accrual for unbilled medical
services rendered through the balance sheet dates based upon a claims payment
lag methodology. The claims payment lag methodology utilized for recording
amounts for unbilled medical claims is based upon historical payment patterns
using actual utilization data, including hospitalization, one day surgeries,
physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and their
corresponding costs. The Company has historically evaluated, and continues to
evaluate, the runoff of prior year claims in order to determine the accuracy
of its estimation process and appropriately adjust the assumptions inherent in
the estimation process for changes to its operating environment and contract
portfolio. Differences between the estimated claims liability and the actual
claims incurred are recorded, in healthcare expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations, in the period in which such differences become
known. Whenever such adjustments are required, the Company also adjusts the
estimates used in its calculation to take into account the positive or
negative trend. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded increases of
approximately $888,000, $617,000 and $6.0&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior
year claims liabilities as a result of differences between actual and
estimated claims experience. See Note 5 for discussion of the adjustment
recorded in 2001. In addition to its internal process for estimating such
liabilities, for contracts which have sufficient claims payment
history, the Company obtains an independent actuarial estimation of such
liabilities on a monthly basis to evaluate the adequacy of the
accrual. The actuarial analysis takes into account historical claims
experience (including the average historical costs and billing lag
time for such services) and other actuarial data.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, reserves have been recorded for the Company&#146;s
self-insurance retention for certain reported and unreported professional and
general liability claims associated with the delivery of medical services and
included in accrued expenses and noncurrent portion of accrued expenses on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is
probable that a loss has been incurred (i.e., expected future healthcare costs
and maintenance costs will exceed anticipated future revenue and stop-loss
insurance recoveries, if material) and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. The Company performs this loss accrual analysis on a
specific contract basis (see Note 3).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, money
market funds and investments with original maturities of three months or less
when purchased. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances
primarily with one high credit quality financial institution. The Company
manages its credit exposure by placing its investments in high quality
securities and by periodically evaluating the relative credit standing of the
financial institution.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Restricted Cash</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restricted cash represents cash used to collateralize outstanding letters
of credit, which collateralize certain performance bonds.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Accounts Receivable</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable represent amounts due from state and local
governments and certain private entities for healthcare services provided by
the Company and pharmaceutical sales of the Company. Accounts receivable are
stated at estimated net realizable value.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Inventories</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmacy and medical supplies inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out method) or market.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Property and Equipment</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred,
whereas expenditures for improvements and replacements are capitalized. The
cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are
removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Goodwill</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;)
No.&nbsp;142, <I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets </I>on January&nbsp;1, 2002, at which
time it ceased amortization of goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142,
goodwill acquired is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, at December
31 of each year, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Important factors taken into
consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review, other than the
required annual review, include the following:

</TABLE>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be
impaired based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of
impairment or as a result of its annual impairment review, any impairment is
measured using a fair-value-based goodwill impairment test as required under
the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;142. Fair value is the amount at which the asset
could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and
may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices
or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of
cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures. The
fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and
assumptions in these valuation techniques.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of its annual review at December&nbsp;31, 2003,
management has determined that goodwill is not impaired. Future events
could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that
goodwill is impaired. Any resulting
impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s
financial condition and results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, goodwill amortization expense of approximately $2.9&nbsp;million,
was computed using the straight-line method over 20&nbsp;years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Contracts and Other Intangibles</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its contract and
other intangibles when events and circumstances warrant, generally in
conjunction with the annual business planning cycle. If the carrying value of
the evaluated asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value. Fair market
value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a
rate commensurate with the risk involved.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company amortizes its contract intangibles on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful life. Contract amortization expense totaled
approximately $1.6&nbsp;million, $1.9&nbsp;million and $1.7&nbsp;million for 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The estimated useful life of the Company&#146;s contract
intangibles is determined by an independent appraisal at the time of the
acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company evaluates the
estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles on at least a
quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and circumstances related to
its retention rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and circumstances
indicate the current estimated life is no longer reasonable, the Company
adjusts the estimated useful life on a prospective basis. For periods prior
to July&nbsp;1, 2002, the estimated useful life of the Company&#146;s contract
intangibles was 20&nbsp;years. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company revised
the estimated life of the contract intangibles, acquired in its 1999
acquisition of EMSA Government Services, Inc., from 20&nbsp;years to 10&nbsp;years. The
revised life impacted contract intangibles with a gross value of $11.2&nbsp;million
and resulted in an increase to amortization of approximately $434,000, or
$0.08 per fully diluted share, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 as
compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2001.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other intangibles are comprised primarily of non-compete agreements.
Amortization of non-compete agreements is calculated over the term of the
related agreements (2 to 10&nbsp;years) and approximates $200,000, $200,000 and
$242,000 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Other Assets</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002 include cash deposits totaling
$15.8&nbsp;million and $8.0&nbsp;million, respectively, which are held by the Company&#146;s
professional liability insurer. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s
professional liability insurance policies for 2003 and 2002, this cash will be
used by the insurer to pay any professional liability claims made against the
Company during those years. Each policy includes a retro premium adjustment
under the terms of which any cash deposits in excess of the ultimate losses
incurred under these policies after a 42&nbsp;month period will be refunded to the
Company. As discussed further in the Professional and General Liability
Insurance section of this Note and Note 19, management monitors the Company&#146;s
estimated exposure related to claims made under the 2003 and 2002 policies
using external and internal evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims, analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves assigned by the
Company&#146;s third-party administrator. Based on this information, management
estimates the amount of cash deposits that will be utilized by the insurer to
pay losses and the amount that will ultimately be refunded to the Company at
the end of the 42&nbsp;month settlement period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002 are deferred
financing costs associated with the Company&#146;s credit facility executed in
October&nbsp;2002 (see Note 11). Such costs are being amortized over the life of
the credit facility and are included in interest expense on the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization expense associated with
deferred financing costs was approximately $566,000, $1.0&nbsp;million and $952,000
for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
amortization expense in 2002 and 2001 also included amortization of deferred
finance costs associated with a prior credit facility. As discussed further
in Note 11, the remaining balance of these costs associated with the prior
credit facility was written-off in the fourth quarter of 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Long-Lived Assets</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets</I>, requires the Company to consider whether indicators of impairment of
long-lived assets held for use (including the Company&#146;s property and
equipment, contracts and other intangibles) are present. If such indicators
are present, the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows attributable to such assets is less than their
carrying amount, and if so, recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess
of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value. Accordingly,
management periodically evaluates the ongoing value of property and equipment
and intangible assets and considers events, circumstances and operating
results, including consideration of contract performance at the fixed price
contract level, to determine if impairment exists. If long-lived assets are
deemed impaired, management adjusts the asset value to fair value (see Note
4).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No.&nbsp;109, <I>Accounting for
Income Taxes</I>. Under the asset and liability method of SFAS 109, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS No.&nbsp;109, the
effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The
Company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets on a quarterly
basis and provides a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets if
it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. At December
31, 2003 and 2002, the Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance equal
to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets that can be
realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Professional and General
Liability Self-insurance Retention</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company maintains its primary professional liability insurance
program principally on a
claims made basis. However, the Company assumes certain self-insurance risks
resulting from the use of large deductibles in 2000 and 2001 and the use of
adjustable premium policies in 2002 and 2003. For 2002 and 2003, the Company
is covered by separate policies, each of which contains a 42-month
retro-premium with adjustment based on actual losses after 42&nbsp;months. The
Company&#146;s ultimate premium for its 2002 policy and its 2003 policy will depend
on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">estimated losses are provided for
on an undiscounted basis using internal and external evaluations of the
merits of the individual claims, analysis of claim history and the estimated
reserves assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator. Any adjustments
resulting from the review are reflected in current earnings.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a
reserve for incurred but not reported claims. The reserve for incurred but
not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis. The Company&#146;s
estimates of this reserve are supported by an independent actuarial analysis
which is obtained on a quarterly basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Other Self-funded Insurance Reserves</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company has approximately $6.8&nbsp;million in accrued
liabilities for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. The Company
is significantly self-insured for employee health and workers&#146; compensation
claims subject to certain individual case stop loss levels. As such, its
insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and the ability to
control the ultimate cost of claims. The Company accrues the estimated
liability for employee health insurance based on its history of claims
experience and time lag between the incident date and the date of actual claim
payment. The Company accrues the estimated liability for workers&#146;
compensation based on internal and external evaluations of the merits of the
individual claims, analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves
assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator. These estimates could
change in the future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Comprehensive Income</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive income encompasses all changes in stockholders&#146; equity
(except those arising from transactions with owners) and includes net income,
unrealized gains or losses on derivatives that qualify as hedges, net
unrealized capital gains or losses on available for sale securities and
foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company&#146;s comprehensive income
(loss)&nbsp;is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Changes in
Stockholders&#146; Equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Strategic Initiative and Severance Expenses</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, the Company incurred certain strategic initiative expenses.
This initiative was discontinued in the third quarter of 2001. Additionally,
during the third quarter of 2001, the Company incurred severance expenses
related to staffing reductions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Stock Options</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
(&#147;APB&#148;) No.&nbsp;25, <I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees</I>, and related
Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB No.
25, compensation expense is recognized as the difference between the exercise
price of the Company&#146;s employee stock options and the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No.&nbsp;123, <I>Accounting for Stock Based Compensation</I>, which also
requires that the information be determined as if the Company has accounted for
its employee stock options granted subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 1994 under the
fair value method of that Statement. The fair value of these options was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting pro forma disclosures may not be representative of that to
be expected in future years. The weighted average fair value of options
granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001, as determined under the fair value
provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123, is $10.32, $6.07 and $3.74, respectively. The
above pro forma adjustments consider option vesting terms but do not include any offsetting tax benefits due to
the Company&#146;s deferred tax valuation allowance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Credit and Other Concentration Risks</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s credit risks relate primarily to cash and cash equivalents,
restricted cash, accounts receivable and deposits on professional liability
and other insurance programs. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
are primarily held in bank accounts and overnight investments. The Company&#146;s
accounts receivable represent amounts due primarily from governmental
agencies. Deposits on professional liability and other insurance programs
represent amounts paid by the Company that are subject to future refund from
the insurance company which provides the coverage. The Company&#146;s financial
instruments are subject to the possibility of loss in carrying value as a
result of either the failure of other parties to perform according to their
contractual obligations or changes in market prices that make the instruments
less valuable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantially
all of the Company&#146;s revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 relates to amounts earned under contracts with state and local
governments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately
18% of the Company&#146;s workforce is represented by labor
unions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;1998, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;133, <I>Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities</I>, as amended in June&nbsp;2000 by SFAS No.&nbsp;138,
<I>Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities</I>,
which requires the Company to recognize all derivatives as assets or
liabilities measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized
through either earnings or other comprehensive income dependent upon the
effectiveness of the hedge instrument. Upon adoption of the provisions of SFAS
No.&nbsp;133, as amended, effective January&nbsp;1, 2001, the Company maintained three
interest collar agreements for a notional amount of $24.0&nbsp;million. Two of the
collars expired during 2002. The third collar was terminated during 2002 at a
cost of approximately $165,000. Consistent with the transition
provisions of
SFAS No.&nbsp;133, the Company recognized in other comprehensive income a cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle equal to the estimated fair value of
the derivative instruments.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;142 which addresses the accounting
for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS
No.&nbsp;142 requires that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized,
and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be
amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. The
Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;142 effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, at which time the
amortization of the Company&#146;s existing goodwill ceased. Other than the effect
on net income of not amortizing goodwill, the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;142 had no
effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.
Amortization expense related to goodwill for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2001
was approximately $2.9&nbsp;million.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro forma adjustment for 2001 does not include any offsetting tax
expense due to the Company&#146;s deferred tax valuation allowance in that
year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;144,
<I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets</i> (&#147;SFAS
No.&nbsp;144&#148;). SFAS No.&nbsp;144 expanded the scope
of financial accounting and reporting of discontinued operations previously
addressed in APB No.&nbsp;30 to require that all components of an entity that have
either been disposed of (by sale, by abandonment, or in a distribution to
owners) or are held for sale and whose operations and cash flows can be
clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes from
the rest of the entity, should be presented as discontinued operations. The
provisions for presenting the components of an entity as discontinued
operations are effective only for disposal activities after the effective date
of SFAS No.&nbsp;144. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 effective
January&nbsp;1, 2002. Pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;144, each of the
Company&#146;s correctional healthcare service contracts is
a component of an entity, whose operations can be distinguished from the rest
of the Company. Therefore, when a contract terminates, by expiration or
otherwise, the contract&#146;s operations generally will be eliminated from the
ongoing operations of the Company and classified as discontinued operations.
Accordingly, the operations of such contracts, that expired during 2002 and
2003, net of applicable income taxes, have been presented as discontinued
operations and prior period Consolidated Statements of Operations have been
reclassified. See Note 4 for a further discussion of discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;45,
<i>Guarantor&#146;s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others</i> (&#147;FIN 45&#148;). This interpretation
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and
annual financial statements concerning its obligations under certain guarantees
that it has issued. It also clarifies (for guarantees issued after January&nbsp;1,
2003) that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The Company adopted FIN 45 effective January&nbsp;1, 2003.
For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company did not have any guarantees
that required recognition as a liability.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, <I>Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities </I>(&#147;FIN 46&#148;), which requires the consolidation of
certain variable interest entities, as defined by FIN 46. FIN 46 requires an
assessment of contractual arrangements to determine if they represent interests
in variable interest entities. Unless they meet the definition of a

consolidation provisions of FIN 46 beginning in fiscal periods ending after
March&nbsp;15, 2004. Additionally, disclosures are required currently if the
Company expects to consolidate any variable interest entities in the future.
The Company is currently evaluating the consolidation requirements of FIN 46.
At this time, the Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this
standard will impact the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position or results
of operation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No.&nbsp;150, <i>Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity</i> (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;150&#148;).
SFAS No.&nbsp;150 requires that an issuer classify certain financial instruments
within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Effective
July&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;150. The adoption of this standard
did not impact the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>3. Charge for Loss Contracts and Reduction in Loss Contract Reserve</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of
contracts for the purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a
contract loss reserve for succeeding periods. As a result of its fourth
quarter 2001 review, the Company identified five non-cancelable contracts that,
based upon management&#146;s projections, were expected to continue to incur
negative gross margins over their remaining terms. In December&nbsp;2001, the
Company recorded a charge of $18.3&nbsp;million to establish a reserve for future
losses under these non-cancelable contracts. Subsequent to 2001, $8.8&nbsp;million
of this charge has been reclassified to income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued
operations due to the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 effective January&nbsp;1, 2001. The
five contracts covered by the charge had expiration dates ranging from June&nbsp;30,
2002 through June&nbsp;30, 2005. Ninety percent of the charge related to the State
of Kansas Department of Corrections (the &#147;Kansas DOC&#148;) contract, which was to
expire on June&nbsp;30, 2005, and the City of Philadelphia contract, which was
renewable annually, at the client&#146;s option, through June&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2002, the Company and the City of Philadelphia reached a mutual
agreement that the contract between PHS and the City of Philadelphia would
expire effective June&nbsp;30, 2002. As a result of the earlier than anticipated
expiration of this loss contract, the Company recorded a gain of $3.3&nbsp;million,
in the second quarter of 2002, to reduce its reserve for loss contracts. From
July&nbsp;1, 2002 to September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company provided services to the City

of Philadelphia under a transition arrangement. Subsequent to September&nbsp;30,
2002, the Company is continuing to provide healthcare services to the City of
Philadelphia under modified contract terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, the Company utilized its loss
contract reserve at a rate greater than previously anticipated due to an
unexpected increase in healthcare expenses associated with the Company&#146;s
contract to provide services to the Kansas DOC. The primary causes for the
increase in healthcare expenses in this contract were hospitalization and
outpatient costs. The Company increased its reserve for loss contracts by $4.5
million, as of June&nbsp;30, 2003, to cover estimated future losses under the Kansas
DOC contract, which was to expire in June&nbsp;2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second and third quarters of 2003, the Company participated in
active discussions with the Kansas DOC related to a proposal from the Company
that would significantly reduce the remaining length of the current contract.
In response to the proposal, the Kansas DOC solicited and received proposals
from several other vendors to provide healthcare services to the Kansas DOC.
After the Kansas DOC&#146;s evaluation of the proposals from the other vendors, in
August&nbsp;2003, the Company began discussions with Health Cost Solutions, Inc.
(&#147;HCS&#148;) and the Kansas DOC related to a proposal pursuant to which HCS would
assume the Company&#146;s performance obligation under the Kansas DOC contract.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company entered into an assignment and novation
agreement with the Kansas DOC to assign the Kansas DOC contract to HCS
effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. The Company also entered into a general assignment,
novation and assumption agreement with HCS to transfer the Kansas DOC contract
to HCS, effective October&nbsp;1, 2003. Beginning October&nbsp;1, 2003, HCS became
solely responsible for the performance of the Kansas DOC contract, and the
Company has no obligation to the Kansas DOC or to HCS related to HCS&#146;
performance of the contract. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s agreement with
HCS, the Company will pay HCS net consideration of $5.6&nbsp;million in 21&nbsp;monthly
installments, commencing October&nbsp;31, 2003 and continuing through June&nbsp;30, 2005.
The net consideration of $5.6&nbsp;million is comprised of payments of $6.5&nbsp;million
to assume

related to fixed assets and inventory purchased from the Company by HCS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the financial terms of the Company&#146;s agreement with HCS, in
the third quarter of 2003, the Company reclassified $6.5&nbsp;million of its reserve
for loss contracts to accounts payable and recorded a gain of $1.7&nbsp;million, to
reduce its reserve for loss contracts. This reduction in the reserve, as well
as the second quarter increase in the reserve of $4.5&nbsp;million, are reflected as
components of income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the
Company&#146;s payable to HCS totals $5.0&nbsp;million, with $3.3&nbsp;million classified as
accounts payable and $1.7&nbsp;million classified as non-current accounts payable on
the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had a loss contract reserve totaling
$0.7&nbsp;million, which relates to a county contract that expires on June&nbsp;30, 2005.
Negative gross margin and overhead costs charged against the loss contract
reserve related to loss contracts, including contracts classified as
discontinued operations, totaled $4.6&nbsp;million and $6.0&nbsp;million for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The amounts charged against
the loss contract reserve during 2002 represented losses associated with all
five of the contracts that were identified during 2001. The amounts charged
against the loss contract reserve during 2003 relate only to the Kansas DOC
contract discussed above and the remaining loss contract, a county contract,
which expires on June&nbsp;30, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company
might identify additional contracts which have become loss contracts due to a
change in circumstances. Circumstances that might change and result in the
identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period include
unanticipated adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure or the
utilization of outside medical services in a contract where such changes are
not offset by increased revenue. Should a contract be identified as a loss
contract in a future period, the Company would record, in the period in which
such identification is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that
would be incurred under the contract. Such a reserve could have a material
adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which it
is recorded.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 and as previously described in
Note 2, the Company has classified correctional healthcare service contracts that have expired subsequent to
January&nbsp;1, 2002 as discontinued operations. Contracts which expired in
periods prior to 2002 are classified as continuing operations. The components
of the income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations are as follows (in

December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, the Company was notified that another vendor had been
selected to negotiate a contract to provide healthcare services for the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>5. Changes in Accounting Estimates</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a change in
accounting estimate charge totaling $6.0&nbsp;million to increase medical claims
reserves due to adverse development of prior year medical claims. The portion
of this charge that relates to contracts that are in continuing operations for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 totals $3.3&nbsp;million and has been included in
healthcare expenses on the accompanying 2001 Consolidated Statement of
Operations. The portion of this charge that relates to contracts that expired
during 2002 and 2003 totals $2.7&nbsp;million and has been included in income
(loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of taxes, on the accompanying 2001
Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company operates in an environment
that requires the estimation of healthcare claims that are inherently
difficult to estimate and are subject to imprecision. The Company estimates
its accrual for unbilled medical services using a claims payment lag
methodology based upon historical payment patterns using actual utilization
data including hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and
emergency room and ambulance visits and their corresponding costs. The
estimates used under the Company&#146;s methodology relate primarily to the cost of
unbilled medical service events and the volume of such events for which the
Company will be responsible. The Company estimates the cost of unbilled
medical service events by tracking the actual historical event cost rates and
using these rates as an indicator of the cost of unbilled events. The volume
and rates of experience of historical reported events are used to estimate the
volume of unbilled events for which the Company will be responsible. These
estimates are subject to change as new events occur, more experience is
acquired, or additional information is obtained.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter of 2001, the Company experienced a significant
increase in its actual versus expected healthcare claim payments experience
related to claims for events prior to December&nbsp;31, 2000. As a result of this
trend, the Company engaged an independent actuary to assist in the estimation
of its accrual for unbilled medical services as of June&nbsp;30, 2001. The Company
also performed its own analysis to enhance its own estimation process of the
unbilled medical services liability. The Company then considered the results
of its internal analysis and the actuarial analyses as compared to the accrual
balance reported at December&nbsp;31, 2000. As a result of these analyses, the
Company determined that its accrual for unbilled medical services occurring
prior to December&nbsp;31, 2000 was underestimated by $6.0&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company analyzed the $6.0&nbsp;million difference between its original
estimate at December&nbsp;31, 2000 and its revised December&nbsp;31, 2000 estimate as of
June&nbsp;30, 2001 and determined that the difference was due to actual medical
costs being higher than estimates of such costs as of December&nbsp;31, 2000 and
actual volume of events to be paid by the Company exceeding the estimates of
such volume as of December&nbsp;31, 2000. At December&nbsp;31, 2000, the Company had
derived its estimates related to the cost and volume of events using actual
historical cost and volume data, including the most recent data at the end of
2000; however, due to the addition of new contracts in 2000, for which the
actual cost and volume experience became available only after December&nbsp;31,
2000, the actual liabilities incurred exceeded the estimates that had been
derived using historical data.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, the Company also recorded changes in accounting estimate
charges of $1.9&nbsp;million for certain legal costs and approximatley $400,000 for
various other charges. The legal costs have been included in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying 2001 Consolidated Statement of
Operations. The other charges have been included in healthcare expenses in
the accompanying 2001 Consolidated Statement of Operations. The charge for
legal costs was primarily related to the bankruptcy of insurance carriers that
provided malpractice insurance to the Company.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>11. Banking Arrangements</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company entered into a new credit facility with
CapitalSource Finance LLC (the &#147;CapitalSource Credit Facility&#148;). The
CapitalSource Credit Facility matures on October&nbsp;31, 2005 and includes both a
$55.0&nbsp;million revolving credit facility (the &#147;Revolver&#148;) and a $5.0&nbsp;million
term loan (the &#147;Term Loan&#148;). Proceeds from the CapitalSource Credit Facility
were used to repay the borrowings outstanding pursuant to the Company&#146;s
previously existing revolving credit facility (the &#147;Prior Credit Facility&#148;), at
which time the Company wrote off approximately $726,000 of deferred loan costs
related to the Prior Credit Facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CapitalSource Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets
of the Company and its operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the
Company had borrowings outstanding under the Revolver totaling $365,000 and
$32.6&nbsp;million available for additional borrowing, based on the Company&#146;s
collateral base on that date and outstanding standby letters of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2003, the Company and CapitalSource Finance LLC entered into an
amendment to the CapitalSource Credit Facility. Under the terms of the
amendment, the Company may have standby letters of credit issued under the loan
agreement in amounts up to $10.0&nbsp;million. The amount available to the Company
for borrowings under the CapitalSource Credit Facility is reduced by the amount
of each outstanding standby letter of credit. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the
Company had outstanding standby letters of credit totaling $4.0&nbsp;million, which
were used to collateralize performance bonds. Prior to this amendment, the
performance bonds were collateralized by restricted cash. As a result of this
amendment, the Company is no longer required to maintain the restricted cash
balances that were previously used as collateral for the performance bonds.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Revolver are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of
eligible receivables (as defined) or (2) $55.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;Revolver
Capacity&#148;). Interest under the Revolver is payable monthly at the greater of
5.75% or the Citibank N.A. prime rate plus 1.0%. The Company is also required
to pay a monthly collateral management fee, equal to an annual rate of 1.38%,
on average borrowings outstanding under the Revolver. Additionally, the
Company is required to pay a monthly letter of credit fee equal to an annual
rate of 3.5% on the outstanding balance of letters of credit issued pursuant to
the Revolver.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the CapitalSource Credit Facility, the Company is
required to pay a monthly unused line fee equal to an annual rate of 0.6% on
the Revolver Capacity less the actual average borrowings outstanding under the
Revolver for the month and the balance of any outstanding letters of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All amounts outstanding under the Revolver will be due and payable on
October&nbsp;31, 2005. If the Revolver is extinguished prior to July&nbsp;1, 2005, the
Company will be required to pay an early termination fee equal to 1.0% of the
Revolver Capacity. In connection with the Revolver, the CapitalSource Credit
Facility requires a lockbox agreement, which provides for all cash receipts to
be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. This agreement, combined with
the existence of a Material Adverse Effect (&#147;MAE&#148;) clause in the CapitalSource
Credit Facility, requires the Revolver to be classified as a current liability,
in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;95-22, <I>Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings
Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements that Include Both a Subjective
Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement</I>. The MAE clause, which is a
typical requirement in commercial credit agreements, allows the lender to
require the loan to become due if the lender determines there has been a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations, business, properties,
assets, liabilities, condition or prospects. The classification of the Revolver
as a current liability is a result only of the combination of the two
aforementioned factors: the lockbox agreements and the MAE clause. The

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Revolver does not expire or have a maturity date within one year. As discussed
above, the Revolver has a final expiration date of October&nbsp;31, 2005.<BR><BR>
At December&nbsp;31, 2003, $3.2&nbsp;million was outstanding under the Term Loan. The
Term Loan requires monthly principal payments of $138,889, through its
maturity on October&nbsp;31, 2005. Interest under the Term Loan is payable monthly
at the greater of 8.5% or the Citibank, N.A. prime rate plus 3.5%. Upon
expiration of the Term Loan, the Company will be required to pay a fee of
$100,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The CapitalSource Credit Facility requires the Company to meet certain
financial covenants related to minimum levels of earnings. At December&nbsp;31,
2003, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. The CapitalSource
Credit Facility also contains restrictions on the Company with respect to
certain types of transactions including acquisition of the Company&#146;s own
stock, payment of dividends, indebtedness and sales or transfers of assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company is dependent on the availability of borrowings pursuant to the
CapitalSource Credit Facility to meet its working capital needs, capital
expenditure requirements and other cash flow requirements during 2004.
Management believes that the Company can comply with the terms of the
CapitalSource Credit Facility and meet its expected obligations throughout
2004. However, should the Company fail to meet its projected results, it may
be forced to seek additional sources of financing in order to fund its working
capital needs.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the Company to record a valuation allowance when it
is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.&#148; It further states that &#147;forming a conclusion that a
valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence
such as cumulative losses in recent years.&#148; At December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002 a
100% valuation allowance has been recorded equal to the deferred tax assets
after considering deferred tax assets that can be realized through offsets to
existing taxable temporary differences. Assuming the Company achieves
sufficient profitability in future years to realize the deferred income tax
assets, the valuation allowance will be reduced in future years through a
credit to income tax expense and additional paid in capital for amounts
related to the exercise of employee stock options.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company has federal and state net operating
loss carryforwards of $21.0&nbsp;million and $48.5&nbsp;million, respectively, which
expire at various dates from 2016 through 2022.

rate, related to income (loss)&nbsp;from continuing operations, is as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>13. Issuance of Common Stock</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;21, 2002, the Company completed a private placement of 480,000
shares of newly issued common stock at $9.50 per share, realizing proceeds of
approximately $4.0&nbsp;million, net of issuance costs. The net proceeds were used
to repay borrowings under the Company&#146;s Prior Credit Facility. The Company
registered the resale of all of the shares on a Form S-3
registration statement (No.&nbsp;333-98355), filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on August&nbsp;19, 2002 and declared effective on October&nbsp;18,
2002.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>14. Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock (the &#147;Preferred Stock&#148;) consisted of
125,000 shares issued during 1999. Each share of the Preferred Stock was
convertible into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock as determined by dividing $100.00 by the conversion price ($9.45) at the
option of the holder and, upon the occurrence of certain events, at the option
of the Company. On January&nbsp;4, 2001, the market price of the Company&#146;s common
stock exceeded 225% of the initial conversion price ($9.45 per share) for 45
consecutive trading days triggering the Company&#146;s ability to force conversion
of the Preferred Stock. As a result, the holders of the Preferred Stock
converted all 125,000 shares of Preferred Stock into 1,323,000 shares of the
Company&#146;s Common Stock on February&nbsp;5, 2001.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2002, the former holders of the Preferred Stock exercised warrants
to purchase 67,500 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at an exercise price
of $0.01 per share using a net exercise provision included in the warrant
agreement. During 2003, the former holders of the Preferred Stock exercised
warrants to purchase 67,500 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at an
exercise price of $9.45 per share using a net exercise provision included in
the warrant agreement. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company has no warrants
outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>15. Stock Option Plans</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has an Incentive Stock Plan (the &#147;Incentive Plan&#148;) which
provides for the granting of options, stock awards and stock appreciation
rights to officers, key employees and non-employee directors for up to
1,483,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. Awards and vesting periods
under the plan are discretionary and are administered by a committee of the
Board of Directors. The exercise price of the options cannot be less than the
fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant. Options
and other benefits expire at such times as the committee determines at the
time of grant, but no later than ten years from the grant date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;30, 1999, stockholders of the Company approved the America
Service Group Inc. 1999 Incentive Stock Plan (the &#147;1999 Plan&#148;) to allow for
the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and
for the purchase of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock and the extension of
recourse loans to certain of the Company&#146;s key employees and outside directors
to permit them to purchase such shares of common stock. There are 786,000
shares of the Company&#146;s common stock available under the 1999 Plan. The
exercise price of the options cannot be less than the fair market value of the
Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant. Options and other benefits expire
at such times as the committee determines at the time of grant, but no later
than ten years from the grant date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Incentive Plan and the 1999 Plan, the Company has also
granted options to certain members of executive management to purchase 235,000
shares of the Company&#146;s common stock (the &#147;Executive Plans&#148;). The exercise
price of these options equaled the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common
stock at the date of grant. The options expire ten years from the date of
grant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following summary presents combined stock option activity under the
Incentive Plan, 1999 Plan and Executive Plans for each of the three years in
the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2001, the effect of
the Company&#146;s potentially dilutive securities (primarily stock options and
warrants) on diluted loss per share during this period was anti-dilutive. For
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, there were
approximately 360,000 and 1,332,000 options, respectively, to purchase common stock with weighted
average exercise prices of $17.79 and $14.09, respectively, excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the options&#146; exercise price
was greater than the average market price for the period of the common shares
and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under SFAS No.&nbsp;128, when one or more quarters has a loss available to
common stockholders, the treasury stock method of computing earnings per share
may yield diluted earnings per share amounts for annual periods that do not
equal the sum of the individual quarter&#146;s diluted earnings per share amounts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>18. Other Employee Benefit Plans</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) covering
substantially all employees who have completed one year and 1,000 hours of
service. The Plan permits eligible employees to defer and contribute to the
Plan a portion of their compensation. The Company may, at the Board&#146;s
discretion, match such employee contributions to the Plan ranging from 1% to
3% of eligible compensation, depending on the employee&#146;s years of
participation. The Company made no matching contributions in 2003, 2002 or
2001.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company instituted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 1996. The
Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to elect to purchase
shares of common stock through voluntary automatic payroll deductions of up to
10% of the employee&#146;s annual salary. Purchases of stock under the plan are
made at the end of two six month offering periods each year, one beginning on
January 1 and one beginning on July 1. At the end of each six-month period,
the employee&#146;s contributions during that six-month period are used to purchase
shares of common stock from the Company at 85% of the fair market value of the
common stock on the first or last day of that six-month period whichever is
lower. The employee may elect to discontinue participation in the plan at any
time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>19. Professional and General Liability Self-insurance Retention</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records a liability for reported and unreported professional
and general liability claims. Amounts accrued were $18.3&nbsp;million and $13.5
million at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are included in
accrued expenses and non-current portion of accrued expenses on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from
the continuous review process and differences between estimates and loss
payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or
payments are made. Reserves for professional and general liability exposures
are subject to fluctuations in frequency and severity. Given the inherent
degree of variability in any such estimates, the reserves reported at December
31, 2003 represent management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts necessary to
discharge the Company&#146;s obligations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 5, during 2001, the Company increased its legal
reserves for professional and general liability claims $1.9&nbsp;million primarily
as a result of liquidity issues of certain insurance carriers who provided
coverage to the Company from 1992 through 1997.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Catastrophic Limits</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require the Company&#146;s customers to
reimburse the Company for all treatment costs or, in some cases, only
out-of-pocket treatment costs related to certain catastrophic events, and/or
for AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses. Certain contracts do not contain such
limits. The Company attempts to compensate for the increased financial risk
when pricing contracts that do not contain individual, catastrophic or
specific disease diagnosis-related limits. However, the occurrence of severe
individual cases, AIDS-related illnesses or a catastrophic event in a facility
governed by a contract without such limitations could render the contract
unprofitable and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
operations. For contracts that do not contain catastrophic protection, the
Company maintains insurance from an unaffiliated insurer for annual
hospitalization amounts in excess of $500,000 per inmate up to an annual per
inmate cap of $2.0&nbsp;million. The Company believes this insurance significantly
mitigates its exposure to unanticipated expenses of catastrophic
hospitalization. Catastrophic insurance premiums and recoveries, neither of
which is significant, are included in healthcare expenses. Receivables for
insurance recoveries, which are not significant, are included in accounts
receivable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Litigation and Claims</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Polk County matter. </I>During 2003, the Company was successful on its appeal
of a previous summary judgment granted against it in January&nbsp;2002 on an
indemnification claim by the insurer of a client. The case has now been
remanded to the lower court in accordance with the appelate court&#146;s opinion as
discussed below. In December&nbsp;1995, the Florida Association of Counties Trust
(&#147;FACT&#148;), as the insurer for the Polk County Sheriff&#146;s Office, and the Sheriff
of Polk County, Florida, brought an action against PHS in the Circuit Court,
10th Judicial Circuit, Polk County, Florida seeking indemnification for $1.0
million paid on behalf of the plaintiffs for settlement of a lawsuit brought
against the Sheriff&#146;s Office. The recovery is sought for amounts paid in
settlement of a wrongful death claim brought by the estate of an inmate who
died as a result of injuries sustained from a beating from several corrections
officers employed by the Sheriff&#146;s Office. In addition, the Sheriff&#146;s Office
released the Company from liability for this claim subsequent to filing the
lawsuit. The plaintiffs contend that an indemnification provision in the
contract between PHS and the Sheriff&#146;s Office obligates the Company to
indemnify the Sheriff&#146;s Office against losses caused by its own wrongful acts.
The Company was represented by counsel provided by Reliance Insurance Company
(&#147;Reliance&#148;), the Company&#146;s insurer. In April&nbsp;2001, FACT&#146;s motion for summary
judgment on the question of liability for indemnity was denied, but on
rehearing in July&nbsp;2001 the prior denial was reversed and summary judgment was
granted. In October&nbsp;2001, Reliance filed for receivership. In January&nbsp;2002,
the court entered final judgment in favor of FACT for approximately $1.7
million at a hearing at which the Company was not represented, as counsel
provided by Reliance had simultaneously filed a motion to withdraw. The
Company retained new counsel in February&nbsp;2002 and obtained a reversal of the
summary judgment motion on October&nbsp;31, 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003,
the Company&#146;s appeal bond in the amount of $2.0&nbsp;million was released. At
December&nbsp;31, 2002, the amount paid for the appeal bond was classified as a
deposit and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The case has been remanded to the trial
court to determine if the actions of the officers, for which some of them were
indicted and convicted, were intentional and whether the claims for which
indemnity was sought arose out of the provision of medical services and not the
actions of the officers. The Company believes it will be successful at the
trial court level. However, in the event that the Company is not successful at
the trial court level, an adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect
on the Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of
operations. The Company has entered into possible settlement negotiations with
the plaintiffs. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company has reserved
approximately $500,000 related to probable costs associated with this
proceeding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Florida Attorney General investigation. </I>Two of the Company&#146;s operating
subsidiaries, EMSA and PHS, have been involved in a sporadic investigation by
the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office related to Medicaid reimbursement issues
from December&nbsp;1, 1998 to the present. The Company acquired EMSA in early 1999.
Although neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have ever billed Medicaid
for reimbursement, the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office has been investigating
allegations, first raised related to EMSA in 1997, that correctional healthcare
providers may have played an indirect role in the submission by independent
healthcare providers of unallowable Medicaid claims for the treatment of
inmates. The Company and its subsidiaries are cooperating fully with the
investigation. Based upon recent discussions with the Florida Attorney
General&#146;s office, the Company believes that the Florida Attorney General&#146;s
office intends to pursue a claim against the Company as part of the State&#146;s
industry-wide investigation of billing practices for inmate healthcare in
Florida.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of these ongoing discussions, the Company requested the medical claims
data from the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office that formed the basis for such
allegations. This data identifies approximately $3.25&nbsp;million of Medicaid
payments to independent providers from December&nbsp;1998 through 2003. The Company
is currently in the process of reviewing the data and comparing it with its own
and other publicly-available records to determine the best course of action to
resolve this matter. Subject to further analysis of the data by the Company
and the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office, the total value of the Medicaid
payments in question to independent providers may be more or less than $3.25
million. Should a settlement of this matter become necessary, the Company is
not able to predict whether the amount of a settlement would be more or less
than $3.25&nbsp;million. In addition to restitution of amounts ultimately
identified as the responsibility of the Company, some portion or all of such
Medicaid payments may be subject to additional fines and penalties. The
Company will continue to cooperate with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office
to seek a prompt, appropriate resolution. It is possible that this matter
could result in a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial results as a
result of ongoing legal fees related to the matter, potential litigation by the
Florida Attorney General&#146;s office or a potential negotiated settlement. At
this time, the Company cannot quantify or predict the actual impact of this
matter on the Company&#146;s financial results. Given the uncertain financial
resolution of this matter, no contingent liability has been accrued at this
time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other matters. </I>In addition to the matter discussed above, the Company is
a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its business. Certain
claims, suits and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business have
been filed or are pending against the Company. An estimate of the amounts
payable on existing claims for which the liability of the Company is probable
is included in accrued expenses at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002. The Company is
not aware of any material unasserted claims and, based on its past experience,
would not anticipate that potential future claims would have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s previous contracts
with the State of Pennsylvania expired during 2002 and, as a result, have been
classified as discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>23. Segment Data</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has two reportable segments: correctional healthcare services
and pharmaceutical distribution services. The correctional healthcare services
segment contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies to provide
healthcare services to inmates of prisons and jails. The pharmaceutical
distribution services segment contracts with federal, state and local
governments and certain private entities to distribute pharmaceuticals and
certain medical supplies to inmates of correctional facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 2. The Company evaluates segment performance based on each segment&#146;s
gross margin without allocation of corporate selling, general and
administrative expenses, interest expense or income tax provision (benefit).
