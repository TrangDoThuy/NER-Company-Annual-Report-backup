Services, Inc. (&#147;PHS&#148;) and Correctional Health Services, LLC (&#147;CHS&#148;), contracts to provide and/or
administer managed healthcare services to over 160 correctional facilities throughout the United
States. Prior to May&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company, through its subsidiary Secure Pharmacy Plus, LLC
(&#147;SPP&#148;), was also a distributor of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. The Company is a leading
non-governmental provider and/or administrator of correctional healthcare services in the United
States.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;12, 2007, SPP and PHS, as guarantor, entered into an asset purchase agreement with
Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corporation (&#147;Maxor&#148;) whereby SPP agreed to sell certain of its
assets at net book value (the &#147;Transaction&#148;). The closing of the Transaction occurred on May&nbsp;3,
2007, with an effective date as of April&nbsp;30, 2007. The net book value of the assets included in
the Transaction was approximately $3.8&nbsp;million as of April&nbsp;30, 2007, which consisted of
approximately $1.9&nbsp;million in inventory and approximately $2.0&nbsp;million in fixed assets, offset by
approximately $0.1&nbsp;million of liabilities for accrued vacation assumed by Maxor. Additionally, as
a condition to the closing of the Transaction, Maxor and PHS entered into a long-term pharmacy
services agreement (the &#147;Services Agreement&#148;) pursuant to which Maxor became the provider of
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to PHS. The Services Agreement commenced effective May&nbsp;1,
2007 and will remain in effect until October&nbsp;31, 2014 (unless terminated earlier in accordance with
the terms of the Services Agreement). During the term of the Services Agreement, PHS will utilize
Maxor on an exclusive basis to provide pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical supplies to PHS,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;24, 2005, the Company announced that the Audit Committee had initiated an internal
investigation into certain matters related to SPP. As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company
announced that the Audit Committee had concluded its investigation and reached certain conclusions
with respect to findings of the investigation that resulted in an accrual of $3.7&nbsp;million of
aggregate refunds due to customers, including PHS, that were not charged by SPP in accordance with
the terms of the respective contracts. In circumstances where SPP&#146;s incorrect billings resulted in
PHS billing its clients incorrectly, PHS passed the applicable amount through to its clients. This
amount plus associated interest represented management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to
affected customers, based on the results of the Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. As of December
31, 2009, the Company has paid all of these refunds plus associated interest to customers except
for $0.4&nbsp;million which has been tendered for payment to the appropriate customers. The ultimate
amounts paid could differ from the Company&#146;s estimates; however, actual amounts to date have not
differed materially from the estimated amounts. There can be no assurance that the Company, a
customer or a third-party, including a governmental entity, will not assert that additional
amounts, which may include penalties and/or associated interest, are owed to these customers.
During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company recognized additional expense totaling $8.4
million relative to this matter  due to the Company recording a reserve related to the settlement in principle reached on February 19, 2010, regarding the shareholder
litigation filed against the Company and certain individual defendants on April 6, 2006;
an insurance settlement for $8.0 million entered into by the Company and its primary directors and officers liability (&#147;D&#038;O&#148;)
insurance carrier; and legal expenses.
The settlement regarding the shareholder litigation, which is subject to final documentation
as well as approval by the Court, provides for payment by the Company of $10.5&nbsp;million and issuance
by the Company of 300,000 shares of common stock and would lead to a dismissal with prejudice of
all claims against all defendants in the litigation (see Note 21 to the Company&#146;s consolidated
financial statements and Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Correctional Healthcare Services</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, through PHS and CHS, contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies
to provide and/or administer healthcare services to inmates of prisons and jails. The Company&#146;s
revenues from correctional healthcare services are generated primarily by payments from
governmental entities, none of which are dependent on third party payment sources although they are
dependent on appropriate governmental funding. The Company provides and/or administers a wide
range of on-site healthcare programs, and arranges for and oversees off-site hospitalization and
specialty outpatient care. The hospitalization and specialty outpatient care is performed by third
parties through arrangements with independent doctors and local hospitals. For the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, revenues from correctional healthcare services accounted for
100%, 100% and 99.4%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s healthcare revenues from continuing operations
and discontinued operations combined. Required financial information related to this business
segment is set forth in Note 23 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s target correctional market consists of state prison systems and county and local
jails. A prison is a facility in which an inmate is incarcerated for an extended period of time
(typically one year or longer). A jail is a facility in which the inmate is held for a shorter
period of time, often while awaiting trial or sentencing. The expected higher inmate turnover in
jails typically requires that healthcare be provided to a much larger number of individual inmates
over time and includes the costs associated with stabilizing and treating whatever health
conditions or injuries are present at the time of initial incarceration. As a result of the higher
number of individual inmate patient encounters and the greater likelihood of previously undiagnosed
acute healthcare needs associated with healthcare in jail settings, the severity and therefore
related costs of treating such patients, particularly with respect to professional liability costs,
are typically greater in jails as opposed to prison systems. Conversely, the costs of chronic
healthcare requirements are generally greater with respect to state prison contracts. State prison
contracts often cover a larger number of facilities and often have longer terms than jail
contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Services Provided and/or Administered. </I>Although the precise type of services to be provided
and/or administered by the Company vary depending on the specific terms of a contract, generally,
the Company&#146;s obligation to provide and/or administer medical services to a particular inmate
begins upon the inmate&#146;s booking into the correctional facility and ends upon the inmate&#146;s release.
In order to reduce costs and provide better care, emphasis is placed upon early identification of
serious injuries or illnesses so that prompt and clinically-effective treatment is commenced.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided and/or administered on-site may include physical and mental health
screening upon intake. Screening includes the compilation of the inmate&#146;s health history and the
identification of any current, chronic or acute healthcare needs. After initial screening,
services provided and/or administered may include regular physical and dental screening and care,
psychiatric care, OB-GYN screening and care and diagnostic testing. Hospitalization is provided
off-site at acute-care hospitals. Sick call is regularly conducted and physicians, nurse
practitioners, physicians&#146; assistants and others are also involved in the delivery of care on a
regular basis. Necessary medications are administered by clinical staff.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided and/or administered off-site may include specialty outpatient
diagnostic testing and care, emergency room care, surgery and hospitalization. This care is

at regional offices and at the Company&#146;s headquarters. Administrative support services may include
program management, maintenance of on-site medical records and employee recruitment, scheduling,
continuing education and quality assurance, medical audits, credentialing, and clinical program
development activities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Company&#146;s correctional contracts require it to staff the facilities it serves with
nurses 24 hours a day. Doctors at the facilities have regular hours and are generally available on
call. In addition, dentists, psychiatrists and other specialists are available on a routine basis
at facilities where correctional contracts cover such services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (&#147;NCCHC&#148;) and the American Correctional
Association (&#147;ACA&#148;) set standards for and offer accreditation to facilities that meet their
respective standards. These standards provide specific guidance related to a service provider&#146;s
operations including administration, personnel, support services such as hospital care, regular
services such as sick call, records management and medical and legal issues. Accreditation with
NCCHC and ACA standards is voluntary and includes many other aspects of the operation of the
correctional facility other than the healthcare component. As such, not all of the Company&#146;s
clients seek this accreditation. For those clients that do request the Company to seek such
accreditation, the Company believes it has a 100% success rate of obtaining and maintaining
accreditation with these organizations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCCHC, an independent not-for-profit organization initially formed by the American Medical
Association, was established to improve the quality of health care in jails, prisons, and juvenile
confinement facilities. NCCHC offers a voluntary health services accreditation program through
external peer review to determine whether correctional institutions meet certain standards in their
provision of health services. NCCHC renders a professional judgment and assists in the improvement
of services provided and/or administered. The ACA, an independent not-for-profit organization, was
established to develop uniformity and industry standards for the operation of correctional
facilities and the provision of inmate healthcare. Accreditation involves an extensive audit and
compliance procedure, and is generally granted for a three-year period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contract Provisions. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions typically fall
into one of three general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee. For fixed
fee contracts, the Company&#146;s revenues are based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service
contract irrespective of inmate population. The Company&#146;s revenues for population-based contracts
are based either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for variances
in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or on a per diem rate multiplied by
the average or actual inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee contracts,
the Company&#146;s revenues are based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a
contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed fee or per diem based upon the
regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts that extend
beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of the Company&#146;s
costs of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. The Company often
bears the risk of increased or unexpected costs, which could result in reduced profits or cause it
to sustain losses when costs are higher than projected. Conversely, the Company will derive
increased profits when costs are lower than projected. Certain contracts also contain financial
penalties when performance and/or staffing criteria are not achieved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Company&#146;s contracts will also include additional provisions that mitigate a
portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in
the majority of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses,
stop-loss provisions, cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of
certain or all off-site service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of
the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically, under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue
under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site
expenses or pharmaceutical costs. While such provisions serve to mitigate the Company&#146;s exposure
to losses resulting from cost fluctuations in the specified cost categories, the Company will still
experience variances in its gross margin percentage on these contracts as the additional revenue
under these contract provisions is typically equal to the additional costs incurred by the Company.
Many contracts contain termination provisions which allow either party to terminate the contract
under agreed-upon notice periods. The ability to terminate a contract serves to mitigate the
Company&#146;s risk related to increasing costs of services being provided.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December 31, 2009, contracts accounting for approximately 7.8% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services
revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 contain no limits on the
Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to off-site expenses, catastrophic illnesses or
injuries to inmates. However, none of these contracts has longer than one year remaining without a
termination provision.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when preparing bid proposals, the Company estimates the extent of its exposure to
cost increases, severe individual cases and catastrophic events and attempts to compensate for its
exposure in the pricing of its bids. The Company&#146;s management has experience in evaluating these
risks for bidding purposes and maintains an extensive database of historical experience.
Nonetheless, increased or unexpected costs against which the Company is not protected could render

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">effort to manage risk under contracts that contain no limits on the Company&#146;s exposure for
treatment costs related to off-site expenses, catastrophic illnesses or injuries to inmates, the
Company typically maintains stop loss insurance from an unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among
other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in
excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual  cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate.
Amounts reimbursable per claim under the policy are further limited to the lesser of 60% of billed
charges, the amount paid or the contracted amounts in situations where the Company has negotiated
rates with the applicable providers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average length of a contract for services is generally one to three years, with subsequent
renewal options. In general, contracts may be terminated by the governmental agency, and often by
the Company as well, without cause at any time upon proper notice. The required notice period for
such contracts ranges from one day to six months, but is typically between 60 and 120&nbsp;days.
Governmental agencies may be subject to political or financial influences that could lead to
termination of a contract through no fault of the Company. As with other governmental contracts,
the Company&#146;s contracts are subject to adequate budgeting and appropriation of funds by the
governing legislature or administrative body.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Administrative Systems. </I>The Company has centralized administrative systems in order to
enhance economies of scale and to provide management with accurate, up-to-date field data for
forecasting purposes. These systems also enable the Company to refine its bids and help the
Company reduce the costs associated with the delivery of consistent healthcare.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a utilization review system to monitor the extent and duration of most
healthcare services required by inmates on an inpatient and outpatient basis. The current
automated utilization review program is an integral part of the services provided and/or
administered at each facility. The system is designed to ensure that the medical care rendered is
medically necessary and is provided safely in a clinically appropriate setting while maintaining
traditional standards of quality of care. The system provides for determinations of medical
necessity by medical professionals through a process of pre-authorization and concurrent review of
the appropriateness of any hospital stay. The system seeks to identify the maximum capability of
on-site healthcare units to allow for a more timely discharge from the hospital back to the
correctional facility. The utilization review staff consists of doctors and nurses who are
supported by medical directors at the regional and corporate levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed a variety of customized databases to facilitate and improve
operational review including (i)&nbsp;a claims management tracking system that monitors current
outpatient charges and inpatient stays, (ii)&nbsp;a comprehensive cost review system that analyzes the
Company&#146;s average costs per inmate at each facility, which includes pharmaceutical utilization and
trend analysis available from Maxor, and (iii)&nbsp;a daily operating report to manage off-site
utilization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bid Process. </I>Contracts with governmental agencies are obtained primarily through a
competitive bidding process, which is governed by applicable state and local statutes and
ordinances. Although practices vary, typically a formal request for proposal (&#147;RFP&#148;), or similar
request or invitation, is issued by the governmental agency, stating the scope of work to be
performed, length of contract, performance bonding requirements, minimum qualifications of bidders,
selection criteria and the format to be followed in the bid or proposal. Usually, a committee
appointed by the governmental agency reviews bids and makes an award determination. The committee
may award the contract to a particular bidder or decide not to award the contract. Typically, the
committee considers a number of factors, including the technical quality of the proposal, the bid
price and the reputation of the bidder for providing quality care. The award of a contract may be
subject to formal or informal protest by unsuccessful bidders through a governmental appeals
process. If the committee does not award a contract, the correctional agency may, among various
options, continue to provide healthcare services to its inmates with its own personnel or the
existing provider.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contractual and Regulatory Compliance. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with governmental agencies
often require it to comply with numerous additional requirements regarding record-keeping and
accounting, non-discrimination in the hiring of personnel, safety, safeguarding confidential
information, management qualifications, professional licensing requirements, emergency healthcare
needs of corrections employees and other matters. If a violation of the terms of an applicable
contractual or statutory provision occurs, a contractor may be debarred or suspended from obtaining
future contracts for specified periods of time in the applicable location. The Company has never
been debarred or suspended from seeking procurements in any jurisdiction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Marketing. </I>The Company gathers, monitors and analyzes relevant information on potential jail
and prison systems which meet predefined new business criteria. These criteria include facility
size, location, revenue and margin potential and exposure to risk. The Company then devotes the
necessary resources in securing new business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes it is one of the largest private providers of healthcare services to
county/municipal jails and detention centers in the United States. The Company will continue to
focus its business development efforts on those facilities where stabilization and treatment of the
population is the primary mission. The Company will also continue to pursue certain opportunities
at state prison systems, where in many cases, services are provided to a larger system with a more
permanent population. Due to the more permanent population at the state prison facilities, the
primary healthcare mission shifts to disease management and treatment.

medical supplies to inmates of correctional facilities. However, as discussed above in Item&nbsp;1.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services provided and/or administered by the Company require an experienced staff of
healthcare professionals and facilities administrators. In particular, a nursing staff with
experience in correctional healthcare and specialized skills in all necessary areas contributes
significantly to the Company&#146;s ability to provide efficient service. In addition to nurses, the
Company&#146;s staff of employees and independent contractors includes physicians, dentists,
psychologists and other healthcare professionals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had approximately 3,840 employees, including
approximately 373 doctors and 1,899 nurses. The Company also utilizes approximately 1,063
independent contractors, including physicians, dentists, psychiatrists, psychologists and other
healthcare professionals. Of the Company&#146;s employees, approximately 655 are represented by labor
unions. The Company believes that its employee relations are good.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental entities is highly
fragmented and competitive with few barriers to entry. The Company is in direct competition with
local, regional and national correctional healthcare providers including certain state medical
schools and other state or municipal organizations. The Company estimates that it currently has
approximately 7% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on its estimates of
national aggregate annual expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its primary
competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates currently has
approximately 7% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, and Wexford Health Sources,
Inc., which the Company estimates currently has approximately 2% of such market. The market share
estimates shown above for the Company reflect its contracts currently in place. The market share
estimates shown above for Correctional Medical Services and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., reflect
the Company&#146;s estimate of contracts currently held by these competitors. As the private market for
providing correctional healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s competitors may gain additional experience
in bidding and administering correctional healthcare contracts. In addition, new competitors, some
of whom may have extensive experience in related fields or greater financial resources than the
Company, may enter the market.

subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations and/or orders of judicial authorities,
including healthcare, pharmaceutical and safety regulations and judicial orders, decrees and

reporting requirements as well as, supervision and on-site monitoring by representatives of the
contracting governmental agencies or courts. In addition, the Company&#146;s doctors, nurses and other
healthcare professionals who provide services on its behalf are in most cases required to obtain
and maintain professional licenses and are subject to state regulation regarding professional
standards of conduct. The Company&#146;s services are also subject to operational and financial audits

Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (&#147;HIPAA&#148;) require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare
claims and payment transactions (&#147;standard transactions&#148;) submitted or received electronically.
These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry.  Beginning
January 28, 2010, the Company began conducting certain standard transactions electronically.  As a result,
the Company became a HIPAA covered entity and is subject to applicable HIPAA regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIPAA includes
extensive privacy and security regulations governing the use and disclosure of protected health information
by health care providers, health care plans and health care clearinghouses (&#147;covered entities&#148;)
and requires covered entities to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the
security of such information.  The American Recovery and Investment Act of 2009 (&#147;ARRA&#148;) expanded
the scope of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations.  ARRA increases civil penalties for violations of
HIPAA and broadens the applicability of criminal penalties to employees of covered entities.  ARRA also
strengthens enforcement of HIPAA by requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to conduct
periodic audits and authorizes state attorney generals to bring civil actions seeking injunctions or damages
in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state
residents.   In addition to HIPAA, most states have enacted laws governing the use and disclosure of patient
health information  These state laws supersede HIPAA to the extent they are more restrictive than the privacy
and security standards in HIPAA.  The Company has in place a HIPAA compliance plan which is enforced and
monitored for compliance by our privacy and security officers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting</I>. Many of the states in which the Company
operates have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations,
from employing physicians or laws that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments or
fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities.
Possible sanctions for violations of these laws include loss of a physician&#146;s license, civil and
criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements that may violate these restrictions.
These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and seldom have been interpreted by the
courts or regulatory agencies. The Company reviews, on an ongoing basis, the applicable laws in
each state in which the Company operates and reviews its arrangements with its healthcare providers
to ensure that these arrangements comply with all applicable laws. The Company can provide no
assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that the
Company, or transactions in which it is involved, are in violation of such laws, or that such laws
ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with the Company&#146;s
interpretations.

a mediator&#146;s proposal to settle all of the claims in this lawsuit. The settlement, which is
subject to final documentation as well as approval by the Court, provides for payment by the
Company of $10.5&nbsp;million and issuance by the Company of 300,000 shares of common stock and would
lead to a dismissal with prejudice of all claims against all defendants in the litigation. The
preliminary total value of the settlement, based upon the Company&#146;s closing share price for its
common stock of $15.42 per share on February&nbsp;19, 2010, is approximately $15.1&nbsp;million. As such,
the Company has recorded a reserve of $15.1&nbsp;million, which has been included in accrued expenses in
the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
The final value of the settlement will be determined based upon the Company&#146;s closing share price at the time of final approval of the settlement by the Court. The settlement
provides for price protection to the plaintiffs in the event the closing share price is below $14.65 per share at the time of final approval of the settlement by the Court.
In such event, the Company would pay in cash the difference between the share value at the time of final approval and $14.65 per share.
The parties are formalizing the
terms of the settlement through a written agreement which will be executed by the parties and
presented to the Court for final approval. Upon final approval of the Court and payment of the
settlement amount, the Company will consider this matter closed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its primary D&#038;O carrier, the Company also maintains D&#038;O insurance with an

in excess of $10.0&nbsp;million. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10K, the excess D&#038;O
carrier has denied coverage of this matter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a risk that the excess D&#038;O carrier will continue to deny coverage of this matter, or
that, even if covered, the Company&#146;s ultimate liability will exceed its recorded reserve and the
available limits of insurance. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a
material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of
operations and/or stock price.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company&#146;s revenue depends on client contracts that are generally terminable without cause
and termination of contracts accounting for a significant portion of its revenue could adversely
affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. </I>The Company&#146;s operating
revenue is derived almost exclusively from contracts with state, county and local governmental
agencies. Generally, contracts may be terminated by the governmental agency without cause upon
proper notice (typically between 60 and 120&nbsp;days). Governmental agencies may be subject to
political or financial influences, including governmental budgetary concerns, that could lead to
termination of a contract or failure to renew or extend a contract through no fault of the Company.
Although the Company generally attempts to renew or renegotiate contracts at or prior to their
termination, contracts that are put out for bid are subject to intense competition. As a result,
the Company&#146;s portfolio of contracts is subject to change. The changes in the Company&#146;s portfolio
of contracts are largely unpredictable, which creates uncertainties about the amount of its total
revenues from period to period. The Company must engage in competitive bidding for new business to
replace contracts that expire or are terminated. The Company, therefore, can provide no assurance
that it will be able to replace contracts that expire or are terminated or are not renewed on
favorable terms or otherwise. The non-renewal or termination, or renewal on unfavorable terms, of
any of the Company&#146;s contracts with governmental agencies could have a material adverse affect on
its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company relies on a small number of client contracts for a significant
portion of its revenues. The combined revenues of the Company&#146;s Rikers Island, New York,
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections and State of Michigan contracts accounted
for approximately 48.7% of the total healthcare revenues from continuing and discontinued
operations combined for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The loss of any of these contracts could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. For more information on the Company&#146;s significant contracts, see Item&nbsp;1. &#147;Business &#151; Major
Contracts.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company&#146;s cash flow depends on timely payment and any delay or failure of its clients to
make payments could adversely affect its results of operations or cash flows. </I>The Company&#146;s cash
flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of, and timely payment by, the governmental
entities with which it contracts. Economic circumstances at the national, state or local level
could affect governmental entity budgets, which could result in insufficient funding, increased
pricing pressure or termination of contracts. In addition, federal, state and local governments
are constantly under pressure to control additional spending or reduce current levels of spending.
Accordingly, if a governmental entity does not receive sufficient or timely funding to cover its
obligations under a healthcare services contract, the contract may be terminated and payment for
the Company&#146;s services could be delayed or not occur. The termination of contracts, a significant
delay in payment or non-payment could adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company&#146;s future growth depends, in part, on further privatization of correctional
healthcare services and it can provide no assurances that such further privatization will occur.</I>
The Company&#146;s future revenue growth depends, in part, on continued privatization by state, county
and local governmental agencies of healthcare services for correctional facilities. The Company
believes, based on marketplace information and internal estimates
that no significant annualized correctional
healthcare contract revenues were newly privatized in 2009 by governmental agencies either for the
first time or as a result of the expansion of existing contracted services to encompass additional
or expanded services. There can be no assurance that this market will continue to grow, or that existing contracts will continue to be made available to the
private sector. Revenue growth could also be adversely affected by material decreases in the
inmate population of correctional facilities. Any of these results could cause the Company&#146;s
revenue to decline and harm its business and operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Negative publicity concerning the Company or its business could adversely affect the Company&#146;s
business, results of operations and ability to obtain future business. </I>Negative publicity
regarding the provision of correctional healthcare services by for-profit companies, including the
Company, or specific alleged actions or inactions of the Company could adversely affect the
Company&#146;s results of operations or business. Privatization of healthcare services for correctional
facilities may encounter resistance from groups or constituencies that believe that healthcare
services to correctional facilities should only be provided by governmental agencies.

its ability to renew or maintain existing contracts or to obtain new contracts, which could have a
material adverse effect on its business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company is subject to extensive government regulations and its failure to comply with such
regulations could adversely affect its business or results of operations. </I>Failure to comply with
governmental regulations and/or orders of judicial authorities could result in material penalties
or non-renewal or termination of the Company&#146;s contracts to manage correctional and detention
facilities. The industry in which the Company operates is subject to extensive federal, state and
local regulations, including educational, healthcare, pharmacy and safety regulations and judicial
orders, decrees and judgments. Some of the regulations are unique to the Company&#146;s industry, and
the combination of regulations it faces is unique. Generally, providers of healthcare services to
correctional facilities must be able to comply with a variety of applicable state and local
regulations and court orders. The Company&#146;s contracts typically include reporting requirements,
supervision and on-site monitoring by representatives of the contracting governmental agencies or
courts. The Company may not always successfully comply with these regulations or court orders, and
failure to comply can result in material penalties, sanctions or non-renewal or termination of
contracts, which could have a materially adverse affect on the Company&#146;s business and results of
operation. For a discussion of certain specific governmental regulations, see Item&nbsp;1. &#147;Business &#151;
Government Regulations.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company is subject to audits and investigations of governmental agencies, which could
result in reduced reimbursements from its clients, refunds to its clients or civil or criminal
penalties. </I>Certain of the governmental agencies with which the Company contracts have the
authority to audit and investigate its contracts with them. As part of that process, governmental
agencies may review the Company&#146;s performance of the contract, its pricing practices, its cost
structure and its compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. For contracts that
actually or effectively provide for certain reimbursement of expenses, if an agency determines that
the Company has improperly allocated costs to a specific contract, it may not be reimbursed for
those costs, and it could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been
reimbursed. If a government audit asserts improper or illegal activities by the Company, it may be
subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of
contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or disqualification
from doing business with certain governmental entities. Any adverse determination could adversely
impact the Company&#146;s ability to bid in response to RFPs in one or more jurisdictions and could have
a materially adverse affect on the Company&#146;s business and results of operation. Additionally, as a
result of any governmental agency investigations and/or audits, the Company&#146;s collections of
balances due from its customers could be substantially delayed. See risk factors below for more
information on the Company&#146;s risk of accounts receivable collection.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company&#146;s business is highly competitive and increased competition could harm its business
and operating results. </I>The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental
agencies is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. The Company is in direct competition
with local, regional and national correctional healthcare providers, including certain state
medical schools and other state or municipal organizations. The Company estimates that it
currently has approximately 7% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on its
estimates of national aggregate annual expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its
primary competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates currently has
approximately 7% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, and Wexford Health Sources,
Inc., which the Company estimates currently has approximately 2% of such market. The market share
estimates shown above for the Company reflect its contracts currently in place. The market share
estimates shown above for Correctional Medical Services and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., reflect
the Company&#146;s estimate of contracts currently held by these competitors. As the private market for
providing correctional healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s competitors may gain additional experience
in bidding and administering correctional healthcare contracts. In addition, new competitors, some
of whom may have extensive experience in related fields or greater financial resources than the
Company, may enter the market. Increased competition could result in a loss of contracts and
market share, or less favorable contract terms, and could seriously harm the Company&#146;s business and
operating results.

acquisitions. The inability to identify, fund and successfully integrate future acquisitions may
seriously reduce the Company&#146;s potential growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts expose it to costs related to catastrophic events, and
therefore any such event could adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition or results of
operations. </I>At December 31, 2009, contracts accounting for approximately 7.8% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare
services revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 contain no limits
on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to catastrophic illnesses or injuries to
inmates. Although the Company attempts to compensate for the increased financial risk when pricing
contracts that do not contain catastrophic limits, there can be no assurance
that the Company will not experience a catastrophic illness or injury of a patient that exceeds its
coverage in the future. The occurrence of severe individual cases outside of the catastrophic
limits contained in the Company&#146;s insurance coverage could render contracts unprofitable and could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company depends on key personnel, the loss of whom could adversely affect its business and
operating results. </I>The success of the Company depends in large part on the ability and experience
of its senior management. The loss of services of one or more key employees could adversely affect
the Company&#146;s business and operating results. The Company has employment contracts with Richard
Hallworth, President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael W. Taylor, Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer and Jonathan B. Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Development
Officer, as well as certain other key personnel. The Company does not maintain key man life
insurance on any member of its senior management.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company faces significant competition for qualified healthcare professionals and its
failure to attract such professionals could adversely affect its operating results. </I>The Company
faces stiff competition for staffing, which may increase its labor, professional liability and
other costs (including contractually mandated penalties) and reduce profitability. The Company
competes with other healthcare and service providers in recruiting qualified management and staff
personnel for the day-to-day operations of its business, including nurses and other healthcare
professionals. In some markets, the scarcity of physicians, nurses and other medical support
personnel is a significant operating issue to healthcare businesses. This scarcity may require the
Company to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified nurses and other healthcare
professionals. Because a significant percentage of the Company&#146;s existing contracts are structured
as fixed fee and/or population based contracts, the Company&#146;s ability to pass along increased labor
costs is limited. If the Company is not successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number
of qualified healthcare personnel in the future, it may not be able to perform under its contracts,
which could lead to the loss of existing contracts or its ability to obtain new contracts.
Moreover, lack of success in this area could further result in the provision of negligent
healthcare services or in the provision of untimely healthcare services, or in the allegation of
such negligent or untimely services (whether valid or invalid), any or all of which could increase
the Company&#146;s exposure to professional, medical, pharmaceutical or other liability expenses.
Additionally, approximately 48% of the Company&#146;s contracts contain financial penalties that apply
when performance or staffing criteria are not achieved. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, the
Company incurred revenue deductions related to these criteria totaling approximately $0.2&nbsp;million,
or less than 1% of the Company&#146;s total healthcare revenues from continuing operations and
discontinued operations combined. Failure to attract qualified management and staff personnel for
the day-to-day operations of the Company&#146;s business could materially adversely affect the Company&#146;s
business and operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>As a result of its business, the Company is exposed to professional liability claims and can
provide no assurances that adequate levels of liability insurance will continue to be available or
that it will not be exposed to claims in excess of its insurance coverage. </I>The Company&#146;s business
ordinarily results in the Company becoming involved in actions for medical malpractice and other
claims related to the provision of healthcare services with the attendant risk of substantial
damage awards, or court endorsed non-monetary relief such as changes in operating practices or
procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in the Company&#146;s operating
expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits
brought by inmates (or their successors) alleging negligent healthcare services or the lack of
timely adequate healthcare services. The Company may also be liable, as employer, for the
negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or healthcare professionals or entities with whom
it contracts. All but one of the Company&#146;s contracts generally provides for the Company to
indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the Company
and its agents. The Company maintains professional and general liability insurance; however, due
to the use of adjustable premium policies in 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2009, with respect
to a majority of its patients, the Company is effectively self-insured for professional liability
claims incurred under its primary program. For 2007, the Company is insured through a claims made
policy subject to per event and aggregate coverage limits. Any amounts ultimately incurred above
the coverage limits contained in the Company&#146;s professional and general liability insurance
policies would be the responsibility of the Company. In addition to its primary program, the
Company also has traditional risk transfer insurance policies that relate to certain specific
healthcare services contracts. Many of the Company&#146;s independent contractors maintain professional
liability insurance in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon the Company&#146;s claims
history and the nature and risks of its business. The Company indemnifies and pays for such
coverage for some of its independent contractors. Management establishes reserves for the
estimated losses that will be incurred under these insurance policies

result of these conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be
adversely affected in the United States. Concern about the stability of the markets, generally,
and the strength of numerous financial institutions, specifically, has led many lenders to reduce,
and in some cases, cease, to provide funding to borrowers. If these market and economic conditions
continue, they may limit the Company&#146;s ability to borrow money from CapitalSource Bank or other
lenders. If the Company is unable to borrow sufficient amounts of money to fund its capital

covenant requirements due to the accrual of expense associated with
settlement of the shareholder  litigation.
For further information regarding the shareholder litigation, see Item 3. &#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148;
The Company has obtained a
waiver of the debt covenant violation and an amendment to the
calculation of the covenant to exclude a portion of the expense
associated with the  shareholder litigation. Should the Company fail to meet its projected results, fail to remain
in compliance with the terms of the credit facility or fail to obtain a waiver, amendment or other
curative document, in the event of default, it may be forced to seek alternative sources of
financing. No assurances can be made that the Company can obtain alternative financing
arrangements on terms acceptable to it, or at all.

operating results. </I>The Company may be exposed to risks related to the overall macro-economic
environment, including deflationary pressures on pricing and governmental budgetary shortfalls that
could result in inadequate payments under its healthcare services contracts. Unfavorable economic
conditions also could increase the Company&#146;s funding and working capital costs, limit its access to
the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to the Company, any of
which would adversely affect the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, operating results or cash

Company&#146;s contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed base fee based upon changes in the
regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts that extend
beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of its cost of
services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. If inflation exceeds
projected levels, depending on the contract structure, the Company&#146;s profitability could be
adversely affected.

such bonds its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. </I>The
Company is required under certain contracts to provide a performance
bond and may also be required to post performance bonds for other
business reasons. At December&nbsp;31, 2009,
the Company had outstanding performance bonds totaling $16.0&nbsp;million. The performance bonds are
renewed on an annual basis. The Company has letters of credit in the amount of $1.6&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2009 that collateralize these performance bonds, reduce availability under the
Company&#146;s credit facility and limit funds available for  working capital. The
Company is also dependant on the financial health of the surety companies that it relies on to
issue its performance bonds. An inability to obtain new or renew existing performance bonds could
result in limitations on the Company&#146;s ability to bid for new or renew existing contracts which
could have a negative effect on the Company&#146;s ability to retain existing contracts or be awarded
new contracts.

accounts receivable, could adversely affect its results of operations. </I>The Company&#146;s accounts

doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past
due, significant one-time events, contractual rights, client funding and/or political pressures,
discussions with clients and historical experience. If circumstances change, estimates of the
recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted and such adjustments could have a material
adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which they are recorded.
Additionally, the timing of the collection of accounts receivable, if delayed, could have a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s cash flows from operations, days sales outstanding in
accounts receivable, cash balances and debt levels outstanding.

can be no assurance that the repurchases will be made or will be made at the best possible price.
The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause the Company&#146;s stock price to be higher
than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity
for its stock. Additionally, the Company is permitted to and could discontinue its stock repurchase
program at any time and any such discontinuation could cause the market price of its stock to
decline.

the Company losing insurance coverage or access to loss funding which has been prepaid to the
insurance carrier. </I>The Company contracts with third party insurance carriers to provide insurance
related to worker&#146;s compensation and professional liability claims for years 2002 to 2006 and 2008
through 2009. The Company&#146;s insurance coverage under these policies is essentially self-insurance
in the form of retro-premium adjustments based on actual claims experience. Under the terms of its
insurance coverage for these policy periods, the Company was required to prepay insurance premiums
to its third party insurance carrier, which are held by the third party insurance carrier to pay
valid claims made under the policies in the same or subsequent years. For the 2007 professional
liability claims policy, the Company has maintained an insurance policy that provides for per event
and aggregate coverage limits on a claims made basis based on a fixed paid premium. If the
financial position and/or liquidity of one of these third party insurance carriers were to become
impaired such that the third party insurer was unable to pay claims or meet its contractual
obligations to the Company, the Company could lose all or a portion of its prepaid premiums to such
carrier and/or lose the benefit of the coverage it has paid for, the occurrence of which could have
a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its results of operations.

a variety of factors deemed relevant by the Company&#146;s directors, including, among other things, the

goodwill resulting in a material non-cash charge to earnings. </I>At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company
had approximately $41.0&nbsp;million of goodwill recorded on its books. The Company expects to recover
the carrying value of this goodwill through its future cash flows. On an ongoing basis, the
Company evaluates, based on the fair value of its business, whether the carrying value of its
goodwill is impaired. If the carrying value of the Company&#146;s goodwill is impaired, it may incur a
material non-cash charge to earnings. The current turmoil in the financial markets and weakness in
macroeconomic conditions globally continue to be challenging and the Company cannot be certain of
the duration of these conditions and their potential impact on its stock price performance. If a
material decline in the Company&#146;s market capitalization and other factors resulted in the decline
in its fair value, it is reasonably likely that a goodwill impairment assessment prior to the next
annual review, at December&nbsp;31, 2010, would be necessary. If such an assessment is required, an
impairment of goodwill may be recognized. A non-cash goodwill impairment charge would have the
effect of decreasing the Company&#146;s earnings or increasing its losses in the period the impairment
is recognized. The amount of such effect on earnings and losses is dependent on the size of the
impairment charge.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Lysager Professional Liability Suit. </I>On November&nbsp;22, 2008, PHS received an adverse jury
verdict in the Sixth Judicial District in and for the County of Bannock, Idaho relating to a
complaint filed on December&nbsp;30, 2004 by Jamie Justice Amos Lysager and Taylor Lysager regarding
medical care provided to the plaintiff while plaintiff was incarcerated at the Pocatello Women&#146;s
Correctional Center in Bannock County, Idaho in February&nbsp;2004. The complaint alleged negligence,
deliberate indifference and intentional infliction of emotional distress by PHS in providing
medical care to plaintiff, then almost 33&nbsp;weeks pregnant, associated with the premature delivery of
plaintiff&#146;s son and sought general and special damages and reimbursement for costs and attorneys
fees incurred by plaintiff in connection with the litigation. The complaint also sought punitive
damages alleging that the actions of PHS&#146; named defendant employees met the minimum statutory
standard for jury consideration of the imposition of punitive damages against PHS, their employer.
A jury trial commenced October&nbsp;28, 2008 and ended, November&nbsp;21, 2008. The verdict was received on
November&nbsp;22, 2008 and consisted of compensatory damages of $0.1&nbsp;million and punitive damages of
$0.2&nbsp;million awarded to plaintiff, and compensatory damages of $1.3&nbsp;million and punitive damages of
$2.0&nbsp;million awarded to plaintiff&#146;s son, resulting in an aggregate award of $3.6&nbsp;million.
Post-trial motions were heard on January&nbsp;29, 2009, whereby PHS challenged the appropriateness and
amounts of the verdict awarded to the plaintiffs and vigorously opposed plaintiff&#146;s request for
attorney fees on grounds of lack of entitlement and method of calculation. However, on March&nbsp;10,
2009, by Memorandum Decision and Order, the plaintiff was granted an award for court costs and
attorney fees totaling $0.2&nbsp;million and the plaintiff&#146;s son was granted an award for court costs
and attorney fees totaling $1.6&nbsp;million, resulting in an aggregate award of $1.8&nbsp;million for court
costs and attorney fees. PHS filed an appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court seeking a reversal of the
adverse verdict and judgment described above, as it believed there were several reversible errors
made by the trial court. In relation to this appeal, the Company posted an appeal bond totaling
$7.4&nbsp;million. On January&nbsp;29, 2010, through a formal mediation session, the parties agreed to
settle all of the claims arising out of and related to this lawsuit for $3.5&nbsp;million. As a result
of this settlement, in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company reduced its recorded reserves for
this matter from $5.4&nbsp;million, which represented the initial jury verdict award plus the award for
court costs and attorney fees discussed above, to the $3.5&nbsp;million settlement amount. The parties
are in the process of formalizing the terms of their settlement through a written settlement
agreement and mutual release (the &#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;). Upon execution of the Settlement

Health Services, Inc. and City of Philadelphia. </I>On or about August&nbsp;2, 2006, plaintiff, an
individual physician independent contractor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a putative class
action suit against PHS and the City of Philadelphia (the &#147;City&#148;) in the Court of Common Pleas of
Philadelphia County, Trial Division, seeking unspecified damages for the class, but damages in the
amount of approximately $10,000 individually. Plaintiff alleges that he provided services to
inmates in the Philadelphia Prison System at the request of the defendants and that the defendants
breached the alleged contractual duties owed to him by paying an amount alleged to be less than the
full amount plaintiff billed for his medical services. On September&nbsp;22, 2006, the City filed a New
Matter Crossclaim against PHS alleging breach of contract, negligence and seeking indemnification.
On September&nbsp;29, 2006, PHS filed its Answer to plaintiff&#146;s complaint, which Answer included a
crossclaim against the City for contribution and indemnification. The plaintiff filed his motion
for class certification on October&nbsp;1, 2007; and PHS and the City responded to this motion. On
January&nbsp;16, 2009, the court denied the plaintiff&#146;s motion for class certification. The plaintiff
has appealed the trial court&#146;s ruling. While PHS believes that the trial court&#146;s ruling denying
class certification is sound and will be upheld on appeal, in the event the appellate court
overturns the trial court&#146;s ruling and PHS is not successful at trial, an adverse judgment could
have a material adverse affect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its results of operations.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company has no reserves associated with this proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Saint Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center v. Correctional Health Services, et al. </I>On or about
February&nbsp;8, 2007, the Company&#146;s subsidiary, CHS, was served with a lawsuit by plaintiff, Saint
Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center (&#147;St. Joseph&#146;s&#148;). Plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court of
New Jersey, Law Division: Passaic County, against CHS, Barnert Hospital, County of Bergen, Bergen
County Jail, County of Essex, Essex County Jail, County of Hudson, Hudson County Jail, County of
Passaic and Passaic County Jail, &#147;John Does #1-30&#148;, &#147;ABC Corporations #1-30&#148;, &#147;XYZ Jails, Prisons
and/or Detention Centers&#148; seeking damages from CHS totaling approximately $2.5&nbsp;million. Plaintiff
claims that CHS failed to administer various contracts with respect to medical claims for the
treatment of certain patients and the payment of such claims between each of the respective
counties and jails named in the complaint and Barnert Hospital, to which St. Joseph&#146;s claims it was
an intended third-party beneficiary. On August&nbsp;15, 2007, Barnert Hospital filed for Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy protection. As a result, the court has stayed the proceedings in the lawsuit pending
resolution of the bankruptcy. CHS intends to defend itself vigorously, and maintains that it is
not responsible for any payments that may be due and owing to the plaintiff. However, a judgment
adverse to CHS could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its
results of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company has no reserves associated with this
proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Matters involving PHS and Baltimore County, Maryland. </I>PHS is currently involved in a
lawsuit with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;) in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of outstanding receivable balances, damages for
breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment as well as prejudgment interest (the
&#147;Collection Matter&#148;). The outstanding receivable balances total approximately $1.7&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and are primarily related to services performed by PHS between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and
September&nbsp;14, 2006 while PHS and the County were jointly seeking a judicial interpretation of a
contract dispute regarding whether the County had timely exercised its renewal options under its
contract with PHS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHS contended that the original term of its contract with the County expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005,
without the County exercising the first of three, two-year renewal options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, PHS
sent a letter to the County stating its position that PHS&#146; contract to provide services expired on
June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s failure to provide such extension notice. The County disputed
PHS&#146; contention asserting that it properly exercised the first renewal option and that the term of
the contract therefore was through June&nbsp;30, 2007, with extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In
July&nbsp;2005, the County and PHS agreed to have a judicial authority interpret the contract through
formal judicial proceedings (the &#147;Contract Matter&#148;). At the written request of the County, PHS
continued to provide healthcare services to the County from July&nbsp;1, 2005 to September&nbsp;14, 2006,
under the terms and conditions of the contested contract, pending the judicial resolution of the
Contract Matter, while reserving all of its rights. Finally, during September&nbsp;2006, amid
reciprocal claims of default, both PHS and the County took individual steps to terminate the
relationship between the parties. PHS contends that it terminated the relationship effective
September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to various breaches by the County, including failure to remit payment of
approximately $1.7&nbsp;million primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and
September&nbsp;14, 2006. On October&nbsp;27, 2006 PHS initiated the Collection Matter lawsuit against the
County.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Collection Matter, although filed, was initially dormant, pending the resolution of the
Contract Matter. As discussed in more detail below, the Contract Matter was resolved in favor of
PHS on August&nbsp;26, 2008, when the Maryland Court of Appeals (the State&#146;s highest appellate court)
denied the County&#146;s request for a review of a Maryland Court of Special Appeals decision in favor
of PHS. After the resolution of the Contract Matter, the parties, during 2009, commenced the
discovery process on the Collection Matter. PHS believes, in the case of the Collection Matter,
that it has a valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the
outstanding receivables, which represent services performed under the relationship between the
parties, are probable of collection. However, although PHS believes it has valid contractual and
legal arguments, an adverse result in the Collection Matter could have a negative impact on PHS&#146;
ability to collect the outstanding receivable amount and result in losses in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, the Contract Matter, mentioned above, was resolved in the following manner. In
November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the County, with
respect to the Contract Matter, ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two-year
renewal option by sending a faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed
this ruling. On December&nbsp;6, 2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this
judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of
July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the case to the Circuit Court to determine whether the County
properly exercised the option by its conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally
decided by the Circuit Court. On May&nbsp;15, 2007, the Circuit Court, upon remand, held a hearing on
the parties&#146; pending cross motions for summary judgment. The Court issued an oral opinion at the
end of the hearing indicating its intention to rule in favor of the County&#146;s motion for summary
judgment and against PHS&#146; motion for summary judgment. On June&nbsp;6, 2007, the Court filed its order
memorializing the aforementioned ruling. In its order, the Court ruled that, by its actions, the
County properly and timely exercised the first two-year renewal option. The Company filed a Notice
of Appeal and on May&nbsp;14, 2008, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals issued its ruling that the
actions the County claimed constituted an exercise of renewal were ineffective. Accordingly, the
Court of Special Appeals reversed the Circuit Court&#146;s ruling and directed it to grant the Company&#146;s
motion for summary judgment in the lawsuit. On June&nbsp;27, 2008, the County petitioned the Maryland
Court of Appeals (the State&#146;s highest appellate court) to review the May&nbsp;14, 2008 Court of Special
Appeals decision. By order dated August&nbsp;26, 2008, the Court of Appeals denied the County&#146;s request
to review the decision, resulting in the ruling of the Court of Special Appeals in favor of the
Company becoming final, thereby bringing closure to the Contract Matter.

December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company announced that its Audit Committee had concluded
its investigation and reached certain conclusions with respect to findings of the investigation
that resulted in the recording of amounts due to SPP&#146;s customers that were not charged in
accordance with the terms of their respective contracts.

contacted the SEC to inform it of the existence of the internal investigation conducted by the
Audit Committee and the issues being investigated. Since that time, the Company has cooperated with
the SEC in the informal inquiry that it conducted. In November&nbsp;2009, the SEC confirmed that its
informal inquiry has been formally closed without any enforcement action. The SEC further
confirmed it never issued a formal order of investigation or a Wells Notice relating to this
matter. As a result of receiving this confirmation from the SEC, the Company considers this matter
closed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has also cooperated with the Office of the U. S. Attorney for the Middle District
of Tennessee (the &#147;U.S. Attorney&#148;) in an informal inquiry
it conducted. The Company has recently been informed that the U.S.
Attorney has no active investigation against the Company.
As a result of receiving this confirmation from the U.S. Attorney,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholder Litigation. </I>On April&nbsp;6, 2006, plaintiffs filed the first of four similar
securities class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee against the Company and the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, at that time, and Chief
Financial Officer. Plaintiffs&#146; allegations in these class action lawsuits are substantially
identical and generally allege on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased the
Company&#146;s common stock between September&nbsp;24, 2003 and March&nbsp;16, 2006 that, prior to the Company&#146;s
announcement of the Audit Committee investigation, the Company and/or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive
Officer, at that time, and Chief Financial Officer violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 by making false and misleading statements,
or concealing information about the Company&#146;s business, forecasts and financial performance. The
complaints seek certification as a class action, unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys&#146; fees
and costs, and other relief. By order dated August&nbsp;3, 2006, the district court consolidated the
lawsuits into one consolidated action and on October&nbsp;31, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended complaint
adding SPP, Enoch E. Hartman III and Grant J. Bryson as defendants. Enoch E. Hartman III is a
former employee of the Company and SPP and Grant J. Bryson is a former employee of SPP. The
amended complaint also generally alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements
concerning the Company&#146;s business which caused the Company&#146;s securities to trade at inflated prices
during the class period. Plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of damages in the form of (i)
restitution; (ii)&nbsp;compensatory damages, including interest; and (iii)&nbsp;reasonable costs and
expenses. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on January&nbsp;19, 2007, and the parties
completed the briefs on the motion in May&nbsp;2007. On March&nbsp;31, 2009, the Court ruled on the
defendants&#146; motion to dismiss, granting it in part and denying it in part. While the Court&#146;s
ruling dismissed significant portions of plaintiffs&#146; amended complaint and, as a result, narrowed
the scope of plaintiffs&#146; claims, none of the defendants were dismissed from the case and several of
plaintiffs&#146; claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and
SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 remain. The parties were not in agreement as to the scope of the Court&#146;s order and
defendants filed a motion to confirm which claims the Court dismissed in its March&nbsp;31, 2009 ruling.
The Court granted defendants&#146; motion to confirm the scope of the dismissal order on July&nbsp;20, 2009,
ruling that certain of Plaintiff&#146;s claims had been in fact dismissed. The Court also confirmed,
however, that certain other claims remained viable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;22, 2009, the Court administratively closed the shareholder litigation case, while the
parties pursued mediation of this matter. On February&nbsp;19, 2010, the parties agreed to the terms of
a mediator&#146;s proposal to settle all of the claims in this lawsuit. The settlement, which is
subject to final documentation as well as approval by the Court, provides for payment by the
Company of $10.5&nbsp;million and issuance by the Company of 300,000 shares of common stock and would
lead to a dismissal with prejudice of all claims against all defendants in the litigation. The
preliminary total value of the settlement, based upon the Company&#146;s closing share price for its
common stock of $15.42 per share on February&nbsp;19, 2010, is approximately $15.1&nbsp;million. As such,
the Company has recorded a reserve of $15.1&nbsp;million, which has been included in accrued expenses in
the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
The final value of the settlement will be determined based upon the Company&#146;s closing share price at the time of final approval of the settlement by the Court. The settlement
provides for price protection to the plaintiffs in the event the closing share price is below $14.65 per share at the time of final approval of the settlement by the Court.
In such event, the Company would pay in cash the difference between the share  value at the time of final approval and $14.65 per share.
The parties are formalizing the
terms of the settlement through a written agreement which will be executed by the parties and
presented to the Court for final approval. Upon final approval of the Court and payment of the
settlement amount, the Company will consider this matter closed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009, the Company and its primary directors and officers liability (&#147;D&#038;O&#148;)
carrier reached an agreement under which the Company and the primary D&#038;O carrier mutually released
each other from future claims related to this matter and the primary D&#038;O carrier remitted insurance
proceeds to the Company totaling $8.0&nbsp;million, less approximately $0.4&nbsp;million in legal fees paid
by the primary D&#038;O carrier as of the settlement date. The Company has paid and/or accrued
additional legal fees incurred through December&nbsp;31, 2009, of $0.8&nbsp;million related to this matter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its primary D&#038;O carrier, the Company also maintains D&#038;O insurance with an
excess D&#038;O carrier that provides for additional insurance coverage of up to $5.0&nbsp;million for losses
in excess of $10.0&nbsp;million. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10K, the excess D&#038;O
carrier has denied coverage of this matter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Delaware Department of Justice Inquiry</I>. On April&nbsp;4, 2006, the Company received a letter
notifying it that the Office of the Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice is conducting
an inquiry into the indirect payment of claims by the Delaware Department of Correction to SPP
beginning in July&nbsp;2002 and ending in the spring of 2005 for pharmaceutical services. There can be
no assurance that the Delaware Department of Justice inquiry will not result in the Company
incurring additional investigation and related expenses; being required to make additional refunds;
incurring criminal, or civil penalties, including the imposition of fines; or being debarred from
pursuing future business in certain jurisdictions. Management of the Company is unable to predict
the effect that any such actions may have on its business, financial condition, results of
operations or stock price. The Company has cooperated and intends to continue to cooperate with
the Delaware Department of Justice during its inquiry.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2010, the Company entered into a $4.3&nbsp;million settlement for a matter in which a
law firm representing a former inmate, for whom the Company provided healthcare services, had sent
notice asserting that the Company was responsible for permanent injuries to the inmate. As a
result of this settlement agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded additional
expense totaling $0.7&nbsp;million to increase its reserves related to this matter to $4.3&nbsp;million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Company now considers this matter closed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s business ordinarily results in labor and employment related claims and matters,
actions for professional liability and related allegations of deliberate indifference in the
provision of healthcare and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services.
Therefore, in addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is a party to a multitude of
filed or pending legal and other proceedings incidental to its business. An estimate of the amounts
payable on existing claims for which the liability of the Company is probable and estimable is
included in accrued expenses. The Company is not aware of any unasserted claims that would have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company did not pay cash dividends on its common stock during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2009. The Company paid a $0.05 per
share on the Company&#146;s common stock for each of the quarters ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and December
31, 2009.
On
March 1, 2010, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.06 per share on the Company&#146;s common stock for the quarter
ended March&nbsp;31, 2010. The dividend will be
paid on April&nbsp;13, 2010 to stockholders of record on
March&nbsp;23, 2010.</div>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors&#146; recent
adoption of a dividend program reflects the Company&#146;s intent to return capital to stockholders.
The Company expects that any future quarterly cash dividends will be paid from cash generated by
the Company&#146;s business in excess of its operating needs, interest and principal payments on
indebtedness, dividends on any future senior classes of the Company&#146;s capital stock, if any,
capital expenditures, taxes and future reserves, if any. Any future dividends will be authorized
by the Board of Directors and declared by the Company based upon a variety of factors deemed
relevant by directors of the Company. In addition, financial covenants in the Credit Agreement may
restrict the Company&#146;s ability to pay future quarterly dividends. The Board of Directors will
continue to evaluate the Company&#146;s dividend program each quarter and will make adjustments as
necessary, based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the Company&#146;s financial
condition, liquidity, earnings projections and business prospects, and no assurance can be given
that this dividend program will not change in the future.

Operations&#148; and Note 6 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report for a description of the reclassification from continuing operations to discontinued
operations of expired contracts. During 2006, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge
for goodwill of $3.0&nbsp;million related to the Company&#146;s pharmaceutical distribution services segment.
During 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded increases of approximately $3.2
million, $6.3&nbsp;million, $10.5&nbsp;million, $4.2&nbsp;million and $4.3&nbsp;million, respectively, to healthcare
expenses as a result of adverse development related to professional liability claims. During 2009,
2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company incurred Audit Committee investigation and related expenses
totaling $8.4&nbsp;million, $0.2&nbsp;million, $0.1&nbsp;million, $5.3&nbsp;million and $3.7&nbsp;million, respectively,
related to an internal investigation into matters at SPP and costs
related to shareholder litigation.
The Audit Committee investigation and related expenses incurred in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 are primarily due to the
Company recording a reserve related to the settlement in principle reached on February 19, 2010, regarding the shareholder litigation; an insurance settlement for $8.0 million entered into by the Company and its primary D&#038;O
insurance carrier; and legal expenses.
For further information regarding the shareholder litigation, see Item 3. &#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148;
During 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
Company recognized share-based compensation expenses of $1.8&nbsp;million, $2.1&nbsp;million, $3.2&nbsp;million and
$4.2&nbsp;million, respectively, as a result of accounting for share-based compensation in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;). See Item&nbsp;1A. &#147;Risk
Factors&#148; for a discussion of material risks that could affect the Company&#146;s results of operations
in the future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working capital amounts as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 include $7.5&nbsp;million, $10.0
million and $12.5&nbsp;million, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the Company&#146;s revolving
credit facilities in place on those dates which were classified as current liabilities based on the
maturity date of the credit facility or in accordance with the U.S. GAAP as discussed below.
Borrowings outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2007 were current due to the fact that the credit facility
was scheduled to mature within a year from the balance sheet date. Borrowings outstanding at
December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005 were scheduled to mature at a date in excess of a year from the
respective balance sheet dates; however, due to the presence of a typical material adverse effect
clause in the loan agreement combined with the existence of a mandatory lock-box agreement,
borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facilities have been classified as current
liabilities in accordance with the U.S. GAAP. For further discussion, see &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; or
Note 14 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by its more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts to provide healthcare services to correctional institutions are
principally fixed price contracts with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing
arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions and aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical
costs. Such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options
and generally may be terminated by either party without cause upon proper notice. Revenues earned
under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are
rendered. Cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and
recognized as income when the service is performed.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fixed fee contracts, revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in
the service contract irrespective of inmate population. Revenues for population-based contracts
are calculated either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for
variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate
multiplied by the average inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee
contracts, revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus
a contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Company&#146;s contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a
portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in
the majority of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses,
stop-loss provisions, cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of
certain or all off-site service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of
the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically, under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue
under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site
expenses or pharmaceutical costs. For contracts that include such provisions, the Company
recognizes the additional revenues due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract
to date costs incurred as compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs.
Because such provisions typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and
require all such additional revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the
additional revenues are initially recorded as unbilled receivables until the time period for
billing has been met and actual costs are known. Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates
of incurred costs and the actual costs are recorded in the period in which such differences become
known along with the corresponding adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related
criteria. If necessary, the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods
when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table below illustrates these revenue categories as a percentage of total revenues from
continuing operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts under the population based and fixed fee categories generally have similar
margins which are higher than margins for contracts under the cost plus a fee category. Cost plus
a fee contracts generally have lower margins but with much less potential for variability due to
the limited risk involved. The Company&#146;s profitability under each of the three general contract
categories discussed above varies based on the level of risk assumed under the contract terms with
the most potential for variability being in contracts under the population based or fixed fee
categories which do not contain the risk mitigating provisions related to off-site utilization
described above. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, contracts accounting for approximately 7.8%
of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing operations do not
contain such risk mitigating provisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and other healthcare
professionals and related benefits and all other direct costs of providing and/or administering
the managed care, including the costs associated with services provided and/or administered by
off-site medical providers, the costs of professional and general liability insurance and other
self-funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below. Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require
the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for all treatment costs or, in some cases, only
treatment costs related to certain catastrophic events, and/or for specific disease diagnoses
illnesses. Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts do not contain such limits. The Company attempts to
compensate for the increased financial risk when pricing contracts that do not contain individual,
catastrophic or specific disease diagnosis-related limits. However, the occurrence of severe
individual cases, specific disease diagnoses illnesses or a catastrophic event in a facility
governed by a contract without such limitations could render the contract unprofitable and could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations. For certain of its contracts that do
not contain catastrophic protection, the Company maintains stop loss insurance from an
unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital
expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual
cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate. Amounts reimbursable per

paid or the contracted amounts in situations where the Company has negotiated rates with the
applicable providers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of healthcare services provided, administered or contracted for are recognized in the
period in which they are provided and/or administered based in part on estimates, including an
accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date. The
Company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization data including
hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and
their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the average historical cost of such services.
Additionally, the Company&#146;s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient
hospital stays in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the historical
average rates. Once identified, reserves for such stays are determined which take into
consideration the specific facts of the stay. An actuarial analysis is also prepared at least
quarterly as an additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the
Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims payment history. The
analysis takes into account historical claims experience (including the average historical costs
and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial data.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant fluctuations occur in the healthcare
cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of claims resulting
from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are
recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made. In 2009,
2008 and 2007, the Company recorded decreases of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million, $0.7&nbsp;million and $6.1
million, respectively, to its prior year claims liabilities as a result of revisions to its
estimated claims expense. The impact to net income of these reductions to the Company&#146;s claims
reserves and associated expense is dependent upon whether any of the associated customer contracts
contained provisions limiting risk of off-site costs. For 2007, the overall decrease in claims
liabilities is net of an increase to the claims liabilities associated with two former full risk
contracts resulting in a negative impact to the Company&#146;s net income of $0.7&nbsp;million. The
reductions to claims reserves in 2008 and 2009 did not result in a significant impact to the
Company&#146;s net income as the changes occurred primarily in connection with contracts which contained
provisions limiting risk of off-site costs and, as a result, these changes were off-set by
corresponding reductions to revenue.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. The Company recognizes
allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors, including the length of time
receivables are past due, significant one-time events, contractual rights, client funding and/or
political pressures, discussions with clients and historical experience. If circumstances change,
estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted and such adjustments could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which they
are recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbilled accounts receivable generally represent additional revenue earned under shared-risk
contracting models that remain unbilled at each balance sheet date, due to provisions within the
contracts governing the timing for billing such amounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its clients will, from time to time, have disputes over amounts billed under
the Company&#146;s contracts. The Company records a reserve for
contractual allowances in
circumstances where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed more fully
in Part&nbsp;I &#150; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; PHS
is currently involved in a
 lawsuit with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;)
involving the County&#146;s lack of payment for services rendered. PHS has approximately $1.7
million of receivables due from the County, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1,
2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006, the date the Company&#146;s relationship with the County was terminated.
The County has refused to pay PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS filed
suit against the County in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of
the outstanding receivables balance, damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust
enrichment as well as prejudgment interest. As discussed more fully
in Part I &#151; Item 3. &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; PHS believes, in the case of this lawsuit, that it has
a valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the outstanding
receivables, which represent services performed under the contractual relationship between the
parties, are probable of collection. Although PHS believes it has valid contractual and legal
arguments, an adverse result in this lawsuit could have a negative impact on the results of this
matter and/or PHS&#146; ability to collect the outstanding receivables amount. These receivables are
classified as other noncurrent assets in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, the Company believes the recorded amount represents valid receivables which
are contractually due from the County and expects full
collection. However, due to the factors discussed above and more fully in Part&nbsp;I &#150; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal
Proceedings,&#148; there is a heightened risk of uncollectibility of these receivables which may result
in future losses. Nevertheless, the Company intends to take all
necessary and available measures in order to collect these receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in circumstances related to the matter discussed above involving the County, or any
other receivables, could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate
of contractual adjustments in future periods. Such change, if it were to occur, could have a
material adverse affect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position in the period

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying potential loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for
succeeding periods if any loss contracts are identified. The Company accrues losses under its
fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. The Company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific
contract basis taking into consideration such factors as the Company&#146;s ability to terminate the
contract, future contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs, projected
future stop-loss insurance recoveries and the contract&#146;s specific terms related to future revenue
increases as compared to increased healthcare costs. The projected future healthcare and
maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost
increases. These estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims
experience as previously noted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might identify
contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances. Circumstances that
might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period
include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions, unanticipated
adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the utilization of outside
medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues.
Should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future period, the Company would record,
in the period in which such identification is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that
would be incurred under the contract. The identification of a loss contract in the future could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which the
reserve is recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no loss contracts identified as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-Insurance Retention</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company&#146;s business occasionally results in actions for
negligence and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the
attendant risk of substantial damage awards, or court ordered non-monetary relief such as, changes
in operating practices or procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in
the Company&#146;s operating expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard
is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services, deliberate
indifference to their medical needs or the lack of timely or adequate healthcare services. The
Company may also be liable, as employer, for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs
or healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The Company&#146;s contracts generally provide for
the Company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided
by the Company and its agents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains a primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. For 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2009
with respect to the majority of its patients, the Company purchased commercial insurance coverage,
but is effectively self-insured due to the terms of the coverage which include adjustable premiums.
For 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2009, the Company is covered by separate policies, each of
which contains a premium that is retroactively adjusted, with adjustment based on actual losses.
The Company&#146;s ultimate premium for its 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2009 policies will depend
on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods. For 2007, the
Company is insured through claims made policies subject to per event and aggregate coverage limits.
Any amounts ultimately incurred above these coverage limits would be the responsibility of the
Company. Management establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will be incurred under
these insurance policies after taking into consideration the Company&#146;s professional liability
claims department and external counsel evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis
of claim history, actuarial analysis and coverage limits where applicable. Any adjustments
resulting from the review are reflected in current earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence, in addition to
its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported
claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">undiscounted basis. The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by various
analyses, including an actuarial analysis, which is performed on a quarterly basis.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company&#146;s reserves for both known and incurred but not reported
claims totaled $25.2&nbsp;million. Reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number
of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next.
Reserves for medical malpractice claims can also fluctuate as a result of court decisions or as new
facts become available. Furthermore, payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities
frequently differ from the estimated liability. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from such
fluctuations and differences between management&#146;s established reserves and actual loss payments are
recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which
the estimates are changed or payments are made. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded
increases of approximately $3.2&nbsp;million, $6.3&nbsp;million and $10.5&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior
year claims reserves as a result of adverse development on individual claims or matters. The
reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the third-party insurance
carriers used by the Company. If a third party insurance carrier fails to meet its contractual
obligations under the agreement with the Company, the Company would then be responsible for such
obligations. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position
and its results of operations in the period in which the changes occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Self-Funded Insurance Reserves</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company has approximately $8.6&nbsp;million in accrued liabilities for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. Approximately $7.1&nbsp;million of this amount is
related to workers&#146; compensation claims, of which approximately $4.5&nbsp;million is included within the
noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is not expected to be paid within a year. The Company
is essentially self-insured for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain
individual case stop loss levels. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims
experience and the ability to control claims. The Company accrues the estimated liability for
employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between
the incident date and the date of actual claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated
liability for workers&#146; compensation claims based on evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims and analysis of claims history. These estimated liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted
basis. An actuarial analysis is prepared at least annually as an additional tool to be considered
by management in evaluating the adequacy of the Company&#146;s reserve for workers&#146; compensation claims.
These estimates of self-funded insurance reserves could change in the future based on changes in
the factors discussed above. Any adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are
reflected in current earnings. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded a decrease of
approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, a decrease of approximately $0.9&nbsp;million, and an increase of
approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, respectively, related to its prior year other self-insurance reserves
as a result of revisions to its estimated claims experience.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Legal Contingencies</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to professional and general liability claims, the Company is also subject to other
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such proceedings generally relate to labor,
employment or contract matters. When estimable, the Company accrues an estimate of the probable
costs for the resolution of these claims. Such estimates are developed in consultation with outside
counsel handling the Company&#146;s defense in these matters and are based upon an estimated range of
potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. The Company
does not believe any of these current proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position. However, it is possible that future results of operations for
any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions,
new developments or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with
such litigation. See discussion of certain outstanding legal matters in Part&nbsp;I &#150; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal
Proceedings.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to professional and general liability claims and other legal proceedings in the
ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in other legal matters related to an Audit
Committee investigation, which was announced by the Company on October&nbsp;24, 2005. See Part&nbsp;1 &#150; Item

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more
frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill be tested at the reporting unit level, defined as an
operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component), with the
fair value of the reporting unit being compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not
considered to be impaired. The Company has determined that it has one operating, as well as one
reportable, segment. The Company&#146;s policy is to perform its annual goodwill impairment test as of
the last day of each fiscal year, i.e. December&nbsp;31.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
performing its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company uses a two-step process. The
first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the
impairment, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company determined the fair value
of its reporting unit to equal the market capitalization of its common stock as of the testing
date. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the indicated fair value of the Company&#146;s reporting unit exceeded
the carrying value of its reporting unit by 338%, and, as such, the Company concluded that there
was no indication of goodwill impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that
the Company&#146;s goodwill is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse
impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.

existence of one or more of the above or other indicators of impairment or as a result of its
annual impairment review, the impairment will be measured using a fair-value-based goodwill
impairment test. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current
transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including
quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of
cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value of the asset could be different
using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer contracts acquired in
acquisitions are amortized on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The
Company also assesses the potential impairment of its other identifiable intangibles whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company determines that the carrying value of other intangible assets may not be
recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, such
impairment will be measured using an estimate of the asset&#146;s fair value based on the projected net
cash flows expected to result from that asset, including eventual disposition.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company amortizes its contract intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life. The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles
on at least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and circumstances, including its
retention rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and circumstances indicate the current
estimated useful life is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the estimated useful life on a
prospective basis.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of U.S. GAAP related to income
taxes. Under the asset and liability method of U.S. GAAP related to income taxes, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. U.S. GAAP requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance
of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million represents management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss
carryforwards which will expire unused.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for tax contingency accruals under the provisions of U.S. GAAP related to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards
based on estimated fair values at the date of grant. Determining the fair value of share-based
awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of
variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility
over the term of the awards and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, the Company
also uses judgment in estimating the number of share-based awards that are expected to be
forfeited.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 6 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, the Company is
applying the discontinued operations provisions of U.S. GAAP to all correctional healthcare service
contracts upon expiration of the contracts. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the results of
operations of contracts that expire, less applicable income taxes, are classified on the Company&#146;s
consolidated statements of operations separately from continuing operations. The presentation
prescribed for discontinued operations requires the collapsing of healthcare revenues and expenses,
as well as other specifically identifiable costs, into the income or loss from discontinued
operations, net of taxes. Items such as indirect selling, general and administrative expenses or
interest expense cannot be allocated to expired contracts. The U.S. GAAP accounting presentation
as it relates to discontinued operations and the Company&#146;s expired contracts has no impact on net
income, earnings per share, total cash flows or stockholders&#146; equity. As a result of the
application of U.S. GAAP related to discontinued operations, &#147;healthcare revenues&#148; and &#147;healthcare
expenses&#148; on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations for any period presented will only
include revenues and expenses from continuing contracts.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare revenues. </I>Healthcare revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 increased
$121.2&nbsp;million, or 25.0%, from $485.0&nbsp;million in 2008 to $606.2&nbsp;million in 2009. Healthcare
revenues in 2009 included $88.3&nbsp;million of revenue growth resulting from new correctional
healthcare services contracts added subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2008 through marketing activities.
The primary correctional healthcare services contract added during this time period was the
Company&#146;s new contract to provide healthcare services to the State of Michigan Department of
Corrections, which commenced on April&nbsp;1, 2009. Correctional healthcare services contracts in place
at January&nbsp;1, 2008 and continuing beyond December&nbsp;31, 2009, experienced revenue growth of 6.8%
consisting of an increase in revenue of $32.9&nbsp;million during 2009 as the result of contract
renegotiations and automatic price adjustments. As discussed in the discontinued operations
section below, all healthcare services contracts that have expired or otherwise been terminated
have been classified as discontinued operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare expenses. </I>Healthcare expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 increased
$113.0&nbsp;million, or 25.4%, from $445.2&nbsp;million, or 91.8% of revenues, in 2008 to $558.2&nbsp;million, or
92.1% of revenues, in 2009. Included in healthcare expenses for each of the years ended December
31, 2009 and 2008 is approximately $0.1&nbsp;million related to share-based compensation expense.
Expenses related to new correctional healthcare services contracts added subsequent to January&nbsp;1,
2008 through marketing activities accounted for $87.4&nbsp;million of the increase. The primary
correctional healthcare services contract added during this time period was the Company&#146;s contract
to provide healthcare services to the State of Michigan Department of Corrections, which commenced
on April&nbsp;1, 2009. Correctional healthcare services contracts in place at January&nbsp;1, 2008
and continuing beyond December&nbsp;31, 2009, accounted for $25.1&nbsp;million of the increase as a result of
increases in the levels of staff and staff compensation, increases in the off-site medical services
and pharmacy costs associated with providing healthcare to inmates at existing contracts. Included
in this increase for continuing contracts is insurance expense of approximately $3.2&nbsp;million and
$6.3&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a result of adverse
development related to professional liability claims. Also included in healthcare expenses for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 is approximately $0.9&nbsp;million and $0.4&nbsp;million of accrued
bonus expenses related to the Company&#146;s 2009 incentive compensation plan and 2008 incentive
compensation plan, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selling, general and administrative expenses. </I>Selling, general and administrative expenses
were $30.0&nbsp;million, or 4.9% of revenues, and $27.0&nbsp;million, or 5.6% of revenues, for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in the selling, general and
administrative expenses for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 is approximately $1.8
million and $2.0&nbsp;million, respectively, related to share-based compensation expense. Also included
in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 is
approximately $2.7&nbsp;million of accrued bonus expense related to the Company&#146;s 2009 incentive
compensation plan. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 is approximately $1.6&nbsp;million of accrued bonus expense related to the Company&#146;s
2008 incentive compensation plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Corporate restructuring expenses. </I>Corporate restructuring expenses were $2.3&nbsp;million for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, which related to the Company
entering into a seperation agreement and general release with its
former Chief Executive Officer on September 15, 2008. There were no corporate restructuring expenses incurred for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

expenses were $8.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 as compared to $0.2&nbsp;million for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The Audit Committee investigation and related expenses incurred in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 are primarily due to the Company recording
a reserve related to the settlement in principle reached on February 19, 2010, regarding the shareholder
litigation filed against the Company and certain individual defendants on April 6, 2006; an insurance
settlement for $8.0 million entered into by the Company and its primary D&#038;O
insurance carrier; and legal expenses.
The settlement regarding the shareholder litigation, which is subject to final documentation as well as
approval by the Court, provides for payment by the Company of $10.5&nbsp;million and issuance by the
Company of 300,000 shares of common stock and would lead to a dismissal with prejudice of all
claims against all defendants in the litigation. The Audit Committee investigation and related
expenses incurred in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, primarily related to the legal costs of
inquiry responses and lawsuit defenses as a result of an internal investigation conducted by the
Audit Committee. See Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; for further discussion of the Audit committee
investigation and related legal matters.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Depreciation and amortization. </I>Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.8&nbsp;million and
$3.8&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The reduction in
depreciation and amortization expense is due to a reduction in contract amortization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest expense, net. </I>Net interest expense decreased to $0.1&nbsp;million in 2009, from $0.7
million in 2008. This decrease is the result of a decrease in the average borrowings outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income tax provision. </I>The income tax provision for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $3.1
million as compared to $2.6&nbsp;million in 2008. See Note 15 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial
statements for more information on the Company&#146;s income tax provision.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company had negative working capital of $2.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to
working capital of $8.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, days sales outstanding
in accounts receivable were 25, accounts payable days outstanding were 19 and medical claims
liability days outstanding were 46. Each of these metrics have been favorably impacted by the
Company&#146;s new contract with the State of Michigan Department of Corrections, which commenced on
April&nbsp;1, 2009. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 31,
accounts payable days outstanding were 41 and medical claims liability days outstanding were 81.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company had net income of $3.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to
$3.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The Company had stockholders&#146; equity of $42.0
million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 as compared to $44.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The Company&#146;s cash
and cash equivalents increased to $37.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 from $24.9&nbsp;million at December
31, 2008. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due
to cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures,
stock repurchases and dividend payments. The Company had no outstanding balance on its credit facility at December&nbsp;31, 2009 or
2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows from operating activities represent net income plus depreciation and amortization,
changes in various components of working capital and adjustments for various non-cash charges, such
as share-based compensation expense and deferred income taxes. Cash flows provided by operating
activities were $24.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 as compared with $28.8&nbsp;million
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a combined net increase of
$16.1&nbsp;million in accounts receivable, deferred taxes, prepaid expenses and
other current assets and other assets in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 as compared with a
combined reduction of $26.0&nbsp;million in these operating assets in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.
 This was partially offset by a combined net increase of
$32.6&nbsp;million in accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued medical claims liability and deferred
revenue in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 as compared with a combined reduction of $7.8&nbsp;million
in these operating liabilities in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in investing activities were $4.5&nbsp;million and $3.4&nbsp;million, respectively, for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 which represented purchases of property and equipment
and management systems under development, which were financed through cash flows from operating
activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 were $7.2
million which represented share repurchases of $8.3&nbsp;million, restricted stock repurchased from
employees for employees&#146; tax liability of $0.2&nbsp;million and dividends on common stock of $0.9
million, partially offset by the issuance of common stock under the Company&#146;s employee stock
purchase plan of $0.3&nbsp;million, excess tax benefits from share-based compensation arrangements of
$0.1&nbsp;million and cash receipts resulting from option exercises of $1.7&nbsp;million. Cash flows used in
financing activities during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
were $9.6&nbsp;million which were primarily due to
share repurchases of $2.4&nbsp;million and $7.5&nbsp;million in net
payments on the line of credit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Share Repurchases</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;27, 2008, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to
repurchase up to $15&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s common stock through the end of 2009. On July&nbsp;28,
2009, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the extension of this program by two years
through the end of 2011, while maintaining the total $15&nbsp;million limit. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009,
the Company has repurchased and retired a total of 858,350 shares of common stock under the stock
repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately $10.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock repurchase program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to
time in either the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with SEC
requirements. The Company may elect to terminate or modify the program at any time. Under the
stock repurchase program, no shares will be purchased directly from officers or directors of the
Company. The timing, prices and sizes of purchases will depend upon prevailing stock prices,
general economic and market conditions and other considerations. Funds for the repurchase of
shares are expected to come primarily from cash provided by operating activities and also from
funds on hand, including amounts available under the Company&#146;s credit facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 18 of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report
for further information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dividends</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company paid a $0.05 cash dividend per share on the Company&#146;s common stock for each of the quarters
ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2009. On March 1, 2010, the Company&#146;s Board of
Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on
the Company&#146;s common stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.The dividend will be paid on April&nbsp;13, 2010 to stockholders of record on
March&nbsp;23, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors&#146; recent adoption of a dividend program reflects the Company&#146;s intent to
return capital to stockholders. The Company expects that any future quarterly cash dividends will
be paid from cash generated by the Company&#146;s business in excess of its operating needs, interest
and principal payments on indebtedness, dividends on any future senior classes of the Company&#146;s
capital stock, if any, capital expenditures, taxes and future reserves, if any. Any future
dividends will be authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Company based upon a
variety of factors deemed relevant by directors of the Company. In addition, financial covenants
in the Credit Agreement may restrict the Company&#146;s ability to pay future quarterly dividends. The
Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Company&#146;s dividend program each quarter and will
make adjustments as necessary, based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the
Company&#146;s financial condition, liquidity, earnings projections and business prospects, and no
assurance can be given that this dividend program will not change in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Credit Facility</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;28, 2009, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement which was
subsequently amended on March 2, 2010 (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) with CapitalSource Bank
(&#147;CapitalSource&#148;). The Credit Agreement is set to mature on October&nbsp;31, 2011 and includes a $40.0
million revolving credit facility, with a current facility cap of $20.0&nbsp;million, under which the Company has
available standby letters of credit up to $15.0&nbsp;million.
The Company may request an increase in the current facility cap of up
to an additional $20.0&nbsp;million subject to lender approval.
The amount available to the Company for
borrowings under the Credit Agreement is based on the Company&#146;s collateral base, as determined
under the Credit Agreement, and is reduced by the amount of each outstanding standby letter of
credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and its
operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the
Credit Agreement and $16.6&nbsp;million available for borrowing,
based on the current facility cap and the Company&#146;s
collateral base on that date less outstanding standby letters of credit totaling $3.4&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of eligible
receivables or (2) the current facility cap (the &#147;Borrowing Capacity&#148;). Interest under the Credit Agreement
is payable monthly at an annual rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2%, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of
3.14%. The Company is also required to pay a monthly collateral management fee equal to 0.042% on
average borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a monthly unused line
fee equal to 0.0375% on the Borrowing Capacity less the actual average borrowings outstanding under
the Credit Agreement for the month and the balance of any outstanding letters of credit.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will be due and payable on October&nbsp;31,
2011. If the Credit Agreement is extinguished prior to July&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company will be required
to pay an early termination fee equal to between $0.4&nbsp;million and $0.8&nbsp;million of the Borrowing
Capacity depending on the date extinguished.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum level of EBITDA of $8.0
million on a trailing twelve-month basis to be measured at the end of each calendar quarter. The
Credit Agreement defines EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation
expense, amortization expense, any other non-cash non-recurring expense, loss from asset sales
outside of the normal course of business and charges and expenses arising out of the Audit
Committee investigation into matters at SPP including any expenses or charges incurred in the
associated shareholder securities suit provided such amounts do not exceed $4.5&nbsp;million in the
aggregate, minus gains on asset sales outside the normal course of business or other non-recurring
gains. The Company was in compliance with the minimum level of EBITDA covenant requirement at
December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement permits the Company to declare and pay cash dividends, but requires the
Company to maintain both a pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio and a post-distribution
fixed charge coverage ratio both calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis to be measured at the
end of each calendar quarter. The Credit Agreement defines the pre-distribution fixed charge
coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding
debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital expenditures and cash income taxes paid or
accrued. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a minimum pre-distribution fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.75. The Credit Agreement defines the post-distribution fixed charge
coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding
debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, cash income taxes paid or
accrued, and cash dividends paid or accrued or declared. The Credit Agreement requires a minimum
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 if the Company&#146;s average net cash (cash less
outstanding debt) plus the average amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is
greater than or equal to $20.0&nbsp;million for the most recent calendar quarter; or, a minimum
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 if the Company&#146;s average net cash (cash less
outstanding debt) plus the average amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is
less than $20.0&nbsp;million for the most recent calendar quarter. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company
was not in compliance with the pre-distribution fixed charge coverage
ratio, as defined prior to the March&nbsp;2, 2010 amendment, principally due to expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009
related to settlement of the shareholder  litigation and has obtained a
waiver of the debt covenant violation from CapitalSource. For further information regarding the shareholder litigation, see Item 3. &#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently believes that cash flows from operating activities, its available cash,
and its expected available credit under the Amended Credit Agreement will continue to enable it to
meet its contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
The Company may, from time to time, consider acquisitions involving other companies or assets.
Such acquisitions or other opportunities may require the Company to raise additional capital by
expanding its existing credit facility and /or issuing debt or equity, as market conditions permit.
If the Company is unable to obtain such additional capital on a timely basis, on favorable terms
or at all, it could have inadequate capital to operate its business, meet its contractual
obligations and capital expenditure requirements or fund potential acquisitions. Current market
and economic conditions, including turmoil and uncertainty in the financial services industry and
credit markets, have caused credit
markets to tighten and led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases,
cease to provide, funding to borrowers. Should the credit markets not improve, the Company can
make no assurances that it would be able to secure additional financing if needed and, if such
funds were available, whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
portion of the Company&#146;s cash resources will need to be used to
fund the settlement of the shareholder litigation
against the Company and certain executive officers. On
February&nbsp;19, 2010 the Company agreed to the terms of a
mediator&#146;s proposed settlement, subject to final documentation
as well as approval by the Court. As part of the settlement, the
Company will pay $10.5&nbsp;million in cash and issue 300,000 shares
of common stock. If the closing share price is below $14.65 per share
at the time of final approval of the settlement by the Court, the
Company will pay the difference in cash.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Company&#146;s contracts provide for annual increases in the base fixed fee based upon
changes in the regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts
that extend beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of its
cost of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. If the rate of
inflation exceeds the levels projected, the excess costs will be absorbed by the Company with the
financial impact dependent upon contract structure. Conversely, the Company may benefit should the
actual rate of inflation fall below the estimate used in the bidding and negotiation process.

to business combinations. This pronouncement addresses the recognition and accounting for
identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business
combinations. This pronouncement requires more assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair value
and requires expense recognition (rather than capitalization) of certain pre-acquisition costs. It
also requires any adjustments to acquired deferred tax assets and liabilities occurring after the
related allocation period to be made through earnings. Furthermore, this pronouncement requires
this treatment of acquired deferred tax assets and liabilities be applied to acquisitions occurring
prior to the effective date of this pronouncement. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008 and is required to be adopted prospectively. The Company
adopted this pronouncement on January&nbsp;1, 2009 and the adoption had no impact on its financial
position or results of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial statements
of the Company due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. The Company&#146;s
exposure to market risk is primarily related to changes in the variable interest rate under the
Company&#146;s Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains an interest rate based on the one-month
LIBOR rate, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 3.14%; therefore the Company&#146;s cash flow may be
affected by changes in the one-month LIBOR rate. A hypothetical 10% change in the underlying
interest rate would have would have had no material effect on interest expense paid under the
Credit Agreement. Interest expense represents less than 0.1% and 0.1% of the Company&#146;s revenues
for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company has no debt outstanding
at December&nbsp;31, 2009.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure controls and procedures are the Company&#146;s controls and other procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported in a complete, accurate and appropriate manner, within the time
periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company evaluated under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures,
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;13a-15 and Rule&nbsp;15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules&nbsp;13a &#150; 15(f).
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;). Based on management&#146;s assessment
under such framework, management concluded that the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.

Brentwood, Tennessee

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of America Service Group Inc. and
subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 based on criteria established in <I>Internal
Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company&#146;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company&#146;s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America Service Group Inc. (&#147;ASG&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) and its consolidated subsidiaries provide
managed healthcare services to correctional facilities under contracts with state and local
governments and certain private entities. The health status of inmates impacts the results of
operations under such contractual arrangements. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Prison Health Services, Inc. (&#147;PHS&#148;),
Correctional Health Services, LLC (&#147;CHS&#148;) and Secure Pharmacy Plus, LLC (&#147;SPP&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;12, 2007, SPP and PHS, as guarantor, entered into an asset purchase agreement with
Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corporation (&#147;Maxor&#148;) whereby SPP agreed to sell certain of its
assets at net book value (the &#147;Transaction&#148;). The closing of the Transaction occurred on May&nbsp;3,
2007, with an effective date as of April&nbsp;30, 2007. The net book value of the assets included in
the Transaction was approximately $3.8&nbsp;million as of April&nbsp;30, 2007, which consisted of
approximately $1.9&nbsp;million in inventory and approximately $2.0&nbsp;million in fixed assets, offset by
approximately $0.1&nbsp;million of liabilities for accrued vacation assumed by Maxor. Additionally, as
a condition to the closing of the Transaction, Maxor and PHS entered into a long-term pharmacy
services agreement (the &#147;Services Agreement&#148;) pursuant to which Maxor became the provider of
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to PHS. The Services Agreement commenced effective May&nbsp;1,
2007 and will remain in effect until October&nbsp;31, 2014 (unless terminated earlier in accordance with
the terms of the Services Agreement). During the term of the Services Agreement, PHS will utilize
Maxor on an exclusive basis to provide pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical supplies to PHS,
except in certain specified situations, including when a PHS client elects or requires PHS to
utilize another pharmacy services provider.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Principles of Consolidation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Use of Estimates</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;U. S. GAAP&#148;) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the more
significant areas requiring estimates in the consolidated financial statements include the
Company&#146;s accruals for unbilled medical services calculated based upon a claims payment lag
methodology, realization of goodwill, estimated amortizable life of contract intangibles,
reductions in revenue for contractual allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, legal
contingencies and share-based compensation as well as accruals associated with employee health,
workers&#146; compensation and professional and general liability claims, for which the Company is
substantially self-insured. Estimates change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, or
additional information is obtained. A change in an estimate is accounted for in the period of
change.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets consist of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Due to
the short term nature of these instruments and the variable interest rate nature of the cash
equivalents, the carrying amounts approximate fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts to provide healthcare services to correctional institutions are
principally fixed price contracts with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing
arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions and aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical
costs. Such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options
and generally may be terminated by either party without cause upon proper notice. Revenues earned

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">are recognized in the period that services are rendered. Cash received in advance for future
services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the service is performed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fixed fee contracts, revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in
the service contract irrespective of inmate population. Revenues for population-based contracts
are calculated either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for
variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate
multiplied by the average inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee
contracts, revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus
a contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Company&#146;s contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a
portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in
the majority of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses,
stop-loss provisions, cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of
certain or all off-site service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of
the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically, under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue
under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site
expenses or pharmaceutical costs. For contracts that include such provisions, the Company
recognizes the additional revenues due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract
to date costs incurred as compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs.
Because such provisions typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and
require all such additional revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the
additional revenues are initially recorded as unbilled receivables until the time period for
billing has been met and actual costs are known. Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates
of incurred costs and the actual costs are recorded in the period in which such differences become
known along with the corresponding adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related
criteria. If necessary, the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods
when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table below illustrates these revenue categories as a percentage of total revenues from
continuing operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

margins which are higher than margins for contracts under the cost plus a fee category. Cost plus
a fee contracts generally have lower margins but with much less potential for variability due to
the limited risk involved. The Company&#146;s profitability under each of the three general contract
categories discussed above varies based on the level of risk assumed under the contract terms with
the most potential for variability being in contracts under the population based or fixed fee
categories which do not contain the risk mitigating provisions related to off-site utilization
described above.

self-funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below. Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require
the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for all treatment costs or, in some cases, only

or specific disease diagnosis-related limits. However, the occurrence of severe individual cases,
specific disease diagnoses illnesses or a catastrophic event in a facility governed by a contract
without such limitations could render the contract unprofitable and could have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s operations. For certain of its contracts that do not contain catastrophic
protection, the Company maintains stop loss insurance from an unaffiliated insurer with respect
to, among other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital expenses (as defined in the policy) for
amounts in excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate. Amounts
reimbursable per claim under the policy are further limited to the lessor of 60% of billed
charges, the amount paid or the contracted amounts in situations where the Company has negotiated
rates with the applicable providers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of healthcare services provided, administered or contracted for are recognized in the
period in which they are provided and/or administered based in part on estimates, including an
accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date. The
Company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization data including
hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and
their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the average historical cost of such services.
Additionally, the Company&#146;s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient
hospital stays in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the historical
average rates. Once identified, reserves for such stays are determined which take into
consideration the specific facts of the stay. An actuarial analysis is also prepared at least
quarterly as an additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the
Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims payment history. The
analysis takes into account historical claims experience (including the average historical costs
and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial data.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant fluctuations occur in the healthcare
cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of claims resulting
from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are
recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made. In 2009,
2008 and 2007, the Company recorded decreases of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million, $0.7&nbsp;million and $6.1
million, respectively, to its prior year claims liabilities as a result of revisions to its
estimated claims expense. The impact to net income of these reductions to the Company&#146;s claims
reserves and associated expense is dependent upon whether any of the associated customer contracts
contained provisions limiting risk of off-site costs. For 2007, the overall decrease in claims
liabilities is net of an increase to the claims liabilities associated with two former full risk
contracts resulting in a negative impact to the Company&#146;s net income of $0.7&nbsp;million. The
reductions to claims reserves in 2008 and 2009 did not result in a significant impact to the
Company&#146;s net income as the changes occurred primarily in connection with contracts which contained
provisions limiting risk of off-site costs and, as a result, these changes were off-set by
corresponding reductions to revenue.

reached the application development stage. Capitalized costs include external direct costs of
materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use software and payroll and
payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the
internal-use software project. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project
stage is complete and ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Goodwill</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more
frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill be tested at the reporting unit level, defined as an
operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component), with the
fair value of the reporting unit being compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not
considered to be impaired. The Company has determined that it has one operating, as well as one
reportable, segment. The Company&#146;s policy is to perform its annual goodwill impairment test as of
the last day of each fiscal year, i.e. December&nbsp;31.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
performing its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company uses a two-step process. The
first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the
impairment, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company determined the fair value
of its reporting unit to equal the market capitalization of its common stock as of the testing
date. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the indicated fair value of the Company&#146;s reporting unit exceeded
the carrying value of its reporting unit by 338%, and, as such, the Company concluded that there
was no indication of goodwill impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that
the Company&#146;s goodwill is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse
impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.

existence of one or more of the above or other indicators of impairment or as a result of its
annual impairment review, any impairment is measured using a fair-value-based goodwill impairment
test. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current
transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including
quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates
of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value of the asset could be
different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.

impairment will be measured using an estimate of the asset&#146;s fair value based on the projected net
cash flows expected to result from that asset, including eventual disposition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company amortizes its contract intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life. The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles
on at least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and circumstances, including its
retention rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and circumstances indicate the current
estimated useful life is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the estimated useful life on a
prospective basis. Contract amortization expense totaled approximately $0.3&nbsp;million, $1.7&nbsp;million
and $1.6&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other intangibles are comprised primarily of non-compete agreements. Amortization of

million and $3.3&nbsp;million, respectively, which are held by the Company&#146;s professional liability
insurer and workers compensation insurer and are not expected to be utilized within the next year.
In addition to cash deposits recorded within other assets, the Company has recorded cash
deposits for professional liability claims losses totaling $8.5&nbsp;million and $6.1&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, within prepaid expenses and other current assets, which
are expected to be utilized within a year. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s professional
liability insurance policies for 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2009, this cash will be used
by the insurer to pay any professional liability claims made against the Company during those
years. Based on evaluation of outstanding claims, management estimates the amount of cash
deposits that will be utilized by the insurer to pay losses within a year.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 are deferred financing costs
associated with the Company&#146;s credit facility (see Note 14). Such costs are being amortized over
the life of the credit facility and such amortization is included in interest expense on the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense associated with deferred
financing costs was approximately $0.1&nbsp;million, $40,000 and $0.1&nbsp;million for the years ended

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company considers whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets held for use
(including the Company&#146;s property and equipment, contracts and other intangibles) are present. If
such indicators are present, the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows attributable to such assets is less than their carrying amount, and if so,
recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their
fair value. Accordingly, management periodically evaluates the ongoing value of property and
equipment and intangible assets and considers events, circumstances and operating results,
including consideration of contract performance at the fixed price contract level, to determine if
impairment exists. If long-lived assets are deemed impaired, management adjusts the asset value
to fair value.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of U.S. GAAP related to income
taxes. Under the asset and liability method of U.S. GAAP related to income taxes, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into

timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. U.S. GAAP requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-Insurance Retention</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company&#146;s business occasionally results in actions for
negligence and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the
attendant risk of substantial damage awards, or court ordered non-monetary relief such as, changes
in operating practices or procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in
the Company&#146;s operating expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard
is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services, deliberate
indifference to their medical needs or the lack of timely or adequate healthcare services. The
Company may also be liable, as employer, for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs
or healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The Company&#146;s contracts generally provide for
the Company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided
by the Company and its agents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains a primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. For 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2009
with respect to the majority of its patients, the Company purchased commercial insurance coverage,
but is effectively self-insured due to the terms of the coverage which include adjustable premiums.
For 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2009, the Company is covered by separate policies, each of
which contains a premium that is retroactively adjusted, with adjustment based on actual losses.
The Company&#146;s ultimate premium for its 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2009 policies will depend
on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods. For 2007, the
Company is insured through claims made policies subject to per event and aggregate coverage limits.
Any amounts ultimately incurred above these coverage limits would be the responsibility of the
Company. Management establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will be incurred under
these insurance policies after taking into consideration the Company&#146;s professional liability
claims department and external counsel evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis
of claim history, actuarial analysis and coverage limits where applicable. Any adjustments
resulting from the review are reflected in current earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence, in addition to
its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported
claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by various analyses, including an actuarial
analysis, which is performed on a quarterly basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Self-funded Insurance Reserves</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company has approximately $8.6&nbsp;million in accrued liabilities for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. Approximately $7.1&nbsp;million of this amount is
related to workers&#146; compensation claims, of which approximately $4.5&nbsp;million is included within the
noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is not expected to be paid within a year. The Company
is essentially self-insured for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain
individual case stop-loss levels. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims
experience and the ability to control claims. The Company accrues the estimated liability for
employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between
the incident date and the date of actual claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated
liability for workers&#146; compensation claims based on evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims and analysis of claims history. An actuarial analysis is prepared at least annually as an
additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the Company&#146;s reserve
for workers&#146; compensation claims. These estimates of self-funded insurance reserves could change
in the future based on changes in the factors discussed above. Any adjustments resulting from such
changes in estimates are reflected in current earnings. In 2009, 2008 and 2007,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">the Company recorded a decrease of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, a decrease of approximately
$0.9&nbsp;million, and an increase of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, respectively, related to its prior
year other self-insurance reserves as a result of revisions to its estimated claims experience.
After considering the impact of earnings that would have been
allocated to participating securities in calculating net
income per common share (see Note 17), the Company&#146;s net income
available to common shareholders and basic and diluted net income per common share were positively impacted
as a result of revisions to its estimated experience by amounts totaling $0.1&nbsp;million and $0.01 per
common share, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and
$0.5&nbsp;million and $0.05 per common share, for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The Company&#146;s net income (loss)&nbsp;and basic and diluted net income

arising from transactions with owners) and includes net income (loss), unrealized gains or losses

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Share-Based Compensation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards
based on estimated fair values at the date of grant. Determining the fair value of share-based
awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of
variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility
over the term of the awards and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, the Company
also uses judgment in estimating the number of share-based awards that are expected to be
forfeited.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 16 for further information on share-based compensation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company leases office space and equipment under certain noncancelable operating leases.
In accordance with the provisions of lease accounting, rent expense under these operating leases
with scheduled rent increases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term,
beginning on the effective date of the lease agreement. Where operating leases contain rent
holidays and tenant build-out incentives or allowances, the Company applies them in the
determination of straight-line rent expense over the lease term. The amount of the excess of
straight-line rent expense over scheduled payments is recorded as a deferred liability on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Credit and Other Concentration Risks</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s credit risks relate primarily to cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and deposits on professional liability and other insurance programs. Cash and cash equivalents are
primarily held in bank accounts and overnight investments. The Company&#146;s accounts receivable
represent amounts due primarily from governmental agencies. Accounts receivable due from the
Virginia Department of Corrections and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections
each represent approximately 22% of accounts receivable, less allowances, at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
Deposits on professional liability and other insurance programs represent amounts paid by the
Company that are subject to future refund from the insurance company which provides the coverage.
Currently, these balances are carried by American International Group for workers compensation and
various regulated subsidiaries of professional liability. The Company&#146;s financial instruments are
subject to the possibility of loss in carrying value as a result of either the failure of other
parties to perform according to their contractual obligations or changes in market prices that make
the instruments less valuable. Additionally, if the financial position and/or liquidity of one of
these third party insurance carriers were to become impaired such that the third party insurer was
unable to pay claims or meet its contractual obligations to the Company, the Company could lose all
or a portion of its prepaid premiums to such carrier and/or lose the benefit of the coverage the
Company has paid for, the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

and requires expense recognition (rather than capitalization) of certain pre-acquisition costs. It
also requires any adjustments to acquired deferred tax assets and liabilities occurring after the
related allocation period to be made through earnings. Furthermore, this pronouncement requires
this treatment of acquired deferred tax assets and liabilities be applied to acquisitions occurring
prior to the effective date of this pronouncement. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008 and is required to be adopted prospectively. The Company

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;24, 2005, the Company announced that the Audit Committee had initiated an internal
investigation into certain matters related to SPP. As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company
announced that the Audit Committee had concluded its investigation and reached certain conclusions
with respect to findings of the investigation that resulted in an accrual of $3.7&nbsp;million of
aggregate refunds due to customers, including PHS, that were not charged by SPP in accordance with
the terms of the respective contracts. In circumstances where SPP&#146;s incorrect billings resulted in
PHS billing its clients incorrectly, PHS passed the applicable amount through to its clients. This
amount plus associated interest represented management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to
affected customers, based on the results of the Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. As of December
31, 2009, the Company has paid all of these refunds plus associated interest to customers except
for $0.4&nbsp;million which has been tendered for payment to the appropriate customers. The ultimate
amounts paid could differ from the Company&#146;s estimates; however, actual amounts to date have not
differed materially from the estimated amounts. There can be no assurance that the Company, a
customer or a third-party, including a governmental entity, will not assert that additional
amounts, which may include penalties and/or associated interest, are owed to these customers.
During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company recognized additional expenses totaling $8.4
million relative to this matter,  due to the Company recording a reserve related to the settlement in principle reached
on February 19, 2010, regarding the shareholder
litigation filed against the Company and certain individual defendants on April 6, 2006; an insurance
settlement for $8.0 million entered into by the Company and its primary directors and officers liability (&#147;D&#038;O&#148;)
insurance carrier; and legal expenses.
The settlement regarding the shareholder litigation, which is subject to final documentation
as well as approval by the Court, provides for payment by the Company of $10.5&nbsp;million and issuance
by the Company of 300,000 shares of common stock and would lead to a dismissal with prejudice of
all claims against all defendants in the litigation (see Note 21).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;15, 2008, the Company entered into a separation agreement and general release
with Michael Catalano, which was subsequently modified on November&nbsp;7, 2008 (the &#147;Separation
Agreement&#148;). Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Catalano resigned his position as
Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective December&nbsp;30, 2008. The Separation Agreement also
provided for Mr.&nbsp;Catalano&#146;s resignation from the Company and from its Board of Directors effective
January&nbsp;1, 2009, the termination of Mr.&nbsp;Catalano&#146;s previously existing employment agreement and the
release of claims by each of Mr.&nbsp;Catalano and the Company against each other. Additionally, in
connection with the restructuring, the Company elected to its Board of Directors and amended the
employment agreements of Richard Hallworth, its current President and Chief Executive Officer, and
Michael W. Taylor, its current Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
The Company incurred a charge related to the Separation Agreement of approximately $2.3&nbsp;million,
comprised of $1.5&nbsp;million in compensation and benefits, a $0.7&nbsp;million non-cash charge related to
the accelerated vesting of remaining unvested stock options and restricted shares and the
modification of the time period in which to exercise stock options and $0.1&nbsp;million in legal and
consulting fees. The non-cash charge related to the stock based compensation is included in

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying potential loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for
succeeding periods if any loss contracts are identified. The Company accrues losses under its
fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. The Company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific
contract basis taking into consideration such factors as the Company&#146;s ability to terminate the
contracts, future contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs, projected
future stop-loss insurance recoveries and each contract&#146;s specific terms related to future revenue
increases as compared to increased healthcare costs. The projected future healthcare and
maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost
increases. These estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims
experience as previously noted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might identify
contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances. Circumstances that
might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period
include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions, unanticipated
adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the utilization of outside
medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues.
Should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future period, the Company would record,
in the period in which such identification is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that
would be incurred under the contract. The identification of a loss contract in the future could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which the
reserve is recorded.
</DIV>

to U.S. GAAP related to discontinued operations, each of the Company&#146;s correctional
healthcare services contracts is a component of an entity whose operations can be distinguished

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a
fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions
in fair value measurements, the Company utilizes the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy that
distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of
the hierarchy) and the reporting entity&#146;s own assumption about market participant assumptions
(unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbilled accounts receivable generally represent additional revenue earned under shared-risk
contracting models that remain unbilled at each balance sheet date, due to provisions within the
contracts governing the timing for billing such amounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its clients will, from time to time, have disputes over amounts billed under
the Company&#146;s contracts. The Company records a reserve for contractual allowances in
circumstances where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
discussed more fully in Note 21, PHS is currently involved in a lawsuit with its former
client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;) involving the County&#146;s
lack of payment for services rendered. PHS has approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of receivables due from
the County, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006,
the date the Company&#146;s relationship with the County was terminated. The County has refused to pay
PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS filed suit against the County in the
Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of the outstanding receivables
balance, damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment as well as
prejudgment interest. As discussed more fully in Note&nbsp;21, PHS believes, in the case of this lawsuit, that it has a valid and
meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the outstanding receivables, which
represent services performed under the contractual relationship between the parties, are probable
of collection. Although PHS believes it has valid contractual and legal arguments, an adverse
result in this lawsuit could have a negative impact on the results of this matter and/or PHS&#146;
ability to collect the outstanding receivables amount. These receivables are classified as other
noncurrent assets in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet (see Note 11).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, the Company believes the recorded amount represents valid receivables which
are contractually due from the County and expects full
collection. However, due to the factors discussed above and more fully in Note 21, there is a
heightened risk of uncollectibility of these receivables which may result in future losses. Nevertheless, the Company intends to take all necessary and available
measures in order to collect these receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in circumstances related to the matter discussed above, or any other receivables,
could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate of contractual
adjustments in future periods. Such change, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse
affect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position in the period in which the
change occurs.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;28, 2009, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement which was
subsequently amended on March&nbsp;2, 2010 (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) with CapitalSource Bank
(&#147;CapitalSource&#148;). The Credit Agreement is set to mature on October&nbsp;31, 2011 and includes a $40.0
million revolving credit facility, with a current facility cap of $20.0&nbsp;million, under which the Company has
available standby letters of credit up to $15.0&nbsp;million.

The Company may request an increase in the current facility cap of up
to an additional $20.0&nbsp;million subject to lender approval.

The amount available to the Company for
borrowings under the Credit Agreement is based on the Company&#146;s collateral base, as determined
under the Credit Agreement, and is reduced by the amount of each outstanding standby letter of
credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and its
operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the
Credit Agreement and $16.6&nbsp;million available for borrowing, based on the current facility cap  and the Company&#146;s
collateral base on that date less outstanding standby letters of credit totaling $3.4&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of eligible
receivables or (2) the current facility cap  (the &#147;Borrowing Capacity&#148;). Interest under the Credit Agreement
is payable monthly at an annual rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2%, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of
3.14%. The Company is also required to pay a monthly collateral management fee equal to 0.042% on
average borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a monthly unused line
fee equal to 0.0375% on the Borrowing Capacity less the actual average borrowings outstanding under
the Credit Agreement for the month and the balance of any outstanding letters of credit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will be due and payable on October&nbsp;31,
2011. If the Credit Agreement is extinguished prior to July&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company will be required
to pay an early termination fee equal to between $0.4&nbsp;million
and $0.8&nbsp;million depending on the
date extinguished.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum level of EBITDA of $8.0
million on a trailing twelve-month basis to be measured at the end of each calendar quarter. The
Credit Agreement defines EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation
expense, amortization expense, any other non-cash non-recurring expense, loss from asset sales
outside of the normal course of business and charges and expenses arising out of the Audit
Committee investigation into matters at SPP including any expenses or charges incurred in the
associated shareholder securities suit provided such amounts do not exceed $4.5&nbsp;million in the
aggregate, minus gains on asset sales outside the normal course of business or other non-recurring
gains. The Company was in compliance with the minimum level of EBITDA covenant requirement at
December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement permits the Company to declare and pay cash dividends, but requires the
Company to maintain both a pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio and a post-distribution
fixed charge coverage ratio both calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis to be measured at the
end of each calendar quarter. The Credit Agreement defines the pre-distribution fixed charge
coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding
debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital expenditures and cash income taxes paid or
accrued. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a minimum pre-distribution fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.75. The Credit Agreement defines the post-distribution fixed charge
coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding
debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, cash income taxes paid or
accrued, and cash dividends paid or accrued or declared. The Credit Agreement requires a minimum
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 if the Company&#146;s average net cash (cash less
outstanding debt) plus the average amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is
greater than or equal to $20.0&nbsp;million for the most recent calendar quarter; or, a minimum
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 if the Company&#146;s average net cash (cash less
outstanding debt) plus the average amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is
less than $20.0&nbsp;million for the most recent calendar quarter. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company
was not in compliance with the pre-distribution fixed charge coverage
ratio, as defined prior to the March&nbsp;2, 2010 amendment,
principally due to expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to
settlement of the shareholder  litigation
and has obtained a
waiver of the debt covenant violation from CapitalSource. For further information regarding the shareholder litigation see Note 21.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical financial results, projected future taxable income and the
expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. U.S. GAAP requires the
Company to record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; At each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, represents
management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss carryforwards which will expire unused.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company has a state net operating loss carryforward of $14.8

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains the 2009 Equity
 Plan  to assist the
Company in attracting, retaining and motivating valued directors, officers, employees, consultants
and other service providers, and to further align their interests with the interests of the
Company&#146;s stockholders, by providing for or increasing their ownership interests in the Company.
The 2009 Equity Plan generally provides for the issuance of (i)&nbsp;incentive stock options; (ii)
nonqualified stock options; (iii)&nbsp;stock appreciation rights (&#147;SARs&#148;); (iv)&nbsp;restricted stock
awards; (v)&nbsp;restricted stock units; and (vi)&nbsp;other stock-based awards to any director, officer,
employee or service provider of the Company and its affiliates. Subject to certain adjustments,
the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2009 Equity Plan in
connection with awards is 500,000 shares. In addition, in any calendar year, no single
participant may receive any award that relates to more than 100,000 shares in the case of options
and SARs, or 50,000 shares in the case of restricted stock, restricted stock units or incentive
awards (as such terms is defined in the 2009 Equity Plan). Additionally, incentive award cash
payments and other stock based award cash payments to any one participant are each limited to
$500,000 in any calendar year. Awards and vesting periods under the 2009 Equity Plan are
discretionary and are administered by the Incentive Stock and Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;). The exercise price of any options granted under the
2009 Equity Plan shall not be less than the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock at the
date of grant. Options expire at such times as the Compensation Committee determines at the time
of grant, but no later than ten years from the grant date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to June&nbsp;9, 2009, the effective date of the 2009 Equity Plan, the Company had an
Incentive Stock Plan (&#147;Incentive Plan&#148;) which provided for the granting of options, stock awards
and stock appreciation rights to officers, key employees and non-employee directors for up to
2,224,500 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. Awards and vesting periods under the Incentive
Plan were discretionary and were administered by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price
of any options granted under the Incentive Plan shall not be less than the fair market value of
the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant. Options and other benefits expire at such times
as the Compensation Committee determines at the time of grant, but no later than ten years from
the grant date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Incentive Plan and prior to June&nbsp;9, 2009, the effective date of the 2009
Equity Plan, the Company maintained the America Service Group Inc. Amended and Restated 1999
Incentive Stock Plan (the &#147;Amended Plan&#148;) to attract and retain eligible employees and outside
directors of the Company, to provide an incentive to eligible employees and outside directors to
work to increase the value of the Company&#146;s common stock and to provide eligible employees and
outside directors with a stake in the future of the Company which corresponds to the stake of each
stockholder. There were 2,439,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock authorized under the
Amended Plan. The exercise price of any options granted under the Amended Plan shall not be less
than the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant. Options and other
benefits expire at such times as the Committee determines at the time of grant, but no later than
10&nbsp;years from the grant date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, there were 468,000 shares available for future grants under the 2009
Equity Incentive Plan
and none available under the Incentive Plan and Amended and Restated
1999 Incentive Stock Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31, 2009, there were $0.2&nbsp;million of total unrecognized compensation costs
related to nonvested stock options granted under the stock incentive plans discussed above. That
cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.72&nbsp;years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company estimated the fair value of each option
award on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company based expected
volatility on historical volatility of the Company&#146;s stock. The Company estimated the expected
term of stock options using historical exercise and employee termination experience. There were no
options granted during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2007. The following table shows the
weighted average assumptions used to develop the fair value estimates
for options granted during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the approved Board of Directors compensation program, each new
non-employee Director (as
defined by the 2009 Equity Plan) upon election to the Board of Directors, receives 10,000
restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock issued pursuant to the 2009 Equity Plan.
Additionally, each non-employee director receives 3,000 restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock on an annual basis. Effective March&nbsp;9, 2009 and August&nbsp;5, 2009, each non-employee director
received 2,200 and 800 restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, respectively, which was an
aggregate grant to all non-employee directors of 15,000 shares. Each new Director and each
non-employee director shall have the right, among other rights, to receive cash dividends on all
of these shares and to vote such shares unless the director&#146;s right to such shares is forfeited.
The shares granted to each new Director upon election to the Board of Directors become
nonforfeitable in equal annual installments over four years beginning on the first anniversary of
the date of grant. The shares granted annually to each non-employee director become
nonforfeitable in equal annual installments over three years beginning on the first anniversary of
the date of grant. The restricted shares are valued at the market value of the Company&#146;s common
stock on the date of grant and are recognized as compensation expense over the restricted stock&#146;s
vesting period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 27, 2009, the Board of Directors unanimously elected Richard D. Wright as its
Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. In connection with Mr.&nbsp;Wright&#146;s service to the Company as
Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, Mr.&nbsp;Wright is being paid a monthly fee of $12,000, effective
February&nbsp;1, 2009. Mr.&nbsp;Wright will receive no additional cash compensation from the Company for his
service on any committees of the Board or his attendance at any meetings of the Board and any
committees thereof. In addition, the Board and the Compensation Committee approved a grant of
3,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company to Mr.&nbsp;Wright (the &#147;Stock Award&#148;) pursuant
to the Amended Plan. The Stock Award has a grant date of January&nbsp;27, 2009 and will vest one third
on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective March&nbsp;9, 2009, the Compensation Committee, approved to award eligible employees
restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock issued pursuant to the Amended Plan totaling
86,700 shares. Each employee shall have the right, among other rights, to receive cash dividends
on all of these shares and to vote such shares unless the employee&#146;s right to such shares is
forfeited.

restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock issued pursuant to the 2009 Equity Plan totaling
28,000 shares. Each employee shall have the right, among other rights, to receive cash dividends

under the plan are made at the end of two six-month offering periods each year, one beginning on
January 1 and one beginning on July 1. At the end of each six-month period, the employee&#146;s
contributions during that six-month period are used to purchase shares of common stock from the

six-month period, whichever is lower. The employee may elect to discontinue participation in the

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net income (loss) per share is measured at two levels: basic income (loss)&nbsp;per common share
and diluted income (loss)&nbsp;per common share. Basic income (loss)&nbsp;per common share is computed by
dividing net income (loss)&nbsp;available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss)&nbsp;per common share is computed by
dividing net income (loss)&nbsp;available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding after considering the additional dilution related to other dilutive
non-participating securities. The Company&#146;s other dilutive non-participating securities
outstanding consist of options to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies that unvested share-based payment
awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or
unpaid, are participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per
share under the &#147;two class&#148; method. In periods where the
Company has income from continuing operations, the &#147;two class&#148; method allocates undistributed earnings between
common shares and participating securities. In periods in which the
Company has incurred a loss from continuing operations, the &#147;two-class&#148; method does
not result in an allocation of such loss between the Company&#146;s common shares and participating securities.
Based on this clarification, the Company has
determined that its unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities. The
modified guidance became effective for the Company on January&nbsp;1, 2009 and the Company is required
to retrospectively apply the modified guidance to any prior periods presented.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has prepared its current period earnings per share calculations and
retrospectively revised its prior period calculations to exclude net income allocated to these
unvested restricted stock awards. Basic and diluted income from continuing operations per share
decreased by $0.01 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. Earnings per share for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 was not impacted as the Company had a loss from continuing operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and diluted earnings per
common share (in thousands except for share and per share data):

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;27, 2008, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to
repurchase up to $15&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s common stock through the end of 2009. On July&nbsp;28,
2009, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the extension of this program by two years
through the end of 2011, while maintaining the total $15&nbsp;million limit. This program is intended
to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in either the open market or through
private transactions, in accordance with SEC requirements. The Company may elect to terminate or
modify the program at any time. Under the stock repurchase program, no shares will be purchased
directly from officers or directors of the Company. The timing, prices and sizes of purchases will
depend upon prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions and other
considerations. Funds for the repurchase of shares are expected to come primarily from cash
provided by operating activities and also from funds on hand, including amounts available under the
Company&#146;s credit facility. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company repurchased and
retired a total of 611,450 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $8.3&nbsp;million. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company has repurchased and retired a total of 858,350 shares of common
stock under the stock repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately $10.6&nbsp;million.

employees who have completed 60&nbsp;days of service. The Plan permits eligible employees to defer and
contribute to the Plan a portion of their compensation. The Company may, at the Board&#146;s
discretion, match such employee contributions to the Plan ranging from 1% to 3% of eligible
compensation, depending on the employee&#146;s years of participation. The Company made no matching

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company&#146;s reserves for both known as
well as  incurred but not reported
professional and general liability claims totaled $25.2&nbsp;million. Reserves for professional and
general liability claims fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying
incidents change from one period to the next. Furthermore, payments with respect to previously
estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability. Changes in estimates of
losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between management&#146;s established reserves
and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for professional and
general liability claims in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made. In
2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded increases of approximately $3.2&nbsp;million, $6.3&nbsp;million and
$10.5&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims reserves as a result of adverse development
on individual claims or matters. After considering the impact of earnings that would have been
allocated to participating securities in calculating net income per
common share (see Note 17), the
Company&#146;s net income available to common shareholders and basic and diluted net income per
common share were negatively impacted as a result of this adverse development by amounts totaling
$1.9&nbsp;million and $0.20 per basic common share and $0.21 per diluted common share, respectively, for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, $3.7&nbsp;million and $0.40 per basic and diluted common share,
respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and $6.2&nbsp;million and $0.66 per basic and diluted
common share, respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The reserves can also be
affected by changes in the financial health of the third-party insurance carriers used by the
Company. If a third party insurance carrier fails to meet its contractual obligations under the
agreement with the Company, the Company would then be responsible for such obligations. Such
changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period
in which the changes occur.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for
all treatment costs or, in some cases, only treatment costs related to certain catastrophic
events, and/or for specific disease diagnoses illnesses. Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts do not
contain such limits. The Company attempts to compensate for the increased financial risk when
pricing contracts that do not contain individual, catastrophic or specific disease
diagnosis-related limits. However, the occurrence of severe individual cases, specific disease
diagnoses illnesses or a catastrophic event in a facility governed by a contract without such
limitations could render the contract unprofitable and could have a material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s operations. For certain of its contracts that do not contain catastrophic protection,
the Company maintains stop loss insurance from an unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among
other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in
excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate.
Amounts reimbursable per claim under the policy are further limited to the lessor of 60% of billed
charges, the amount paid or the contracted amounts in situations where the Company has negotiated
rates with the applicable providers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Lysager Professional Liability Suit. </I>On November&nbsp;22, 2008, PHS received an adverse jury
verdict in the Sixth Judicial District in and for the County of Bannock, Idaho relating to a
complaint filed on December&nbsp;30, 2004 by Jamie Justice Amos Lysager and Taylor Lysager regarding
medical care provided to the plaintiff while plaintiff was incarcerated at the Pocatello Women&#146;s
Correctional Center in Bannock County, Idaho in February&nbsp;2004. The complaint alleged negligence,
deliberate indifference and intentional infliction of emotional distress by PHS in providing
medical care to plaintiff, then almost 33&nbsp;weeks pregnant, associated with the premature delivery of
plaintiff&#146;s son and sought general and special damages and reimbursement for costs and attorneys
fees incurred by plaintiff in connection with the litigation. The complaint also sought punitive
damages alleging that the actions of PHS&#146; named defendant employees met the minimum statutory
standard for jury consideration of the imposition of punitive damages against PHS, their employer.
A jury trial commenced October&nbsp;28, 2008 and ended, November&nbsp;21, 2008. The verdict was received on
November&nbsp;22, 2008 and consisted of compensatory damages of $0.1&nbsp;million and punitive damages of
$0.2&nbsp;million awarded to plaintiff, and compensatory damages of $1.3&nbsp;million and punitive damages of
$2.0&nbsp;million awarded to plaintiff&#146;s son, resulting in an aggregate award of $3.6&nbsp;million.
Post-trial motions were heard on January&nbsp;29, 2009, whereby PHS challenged the appropriateness and
amounts of the verdict awarded to the plaintiffs and vigorously opposed plaintiff&#146;s request for
attorney fees on grounds of lack of entitlement and method of calculation. However, on March&nbsp;10,
2009, by Memorandum Decision and Order, the plaintiff was granted an award for court costs and
attorney fees totaling $0.2&nbsp;million and the plaintiff&#146;s son was granted an award for court costs
and attorney fees totaling $1.6&nbsp;million, resulting in an aggregate award of $1.8&nbsp;million for court
costs and attorney fees. PHS filed an appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court seeking a reversal of the
adverse verdict and judgment described above, as it believed there were several reversible errors
made by the trial court. In relation to this appeal, the Company posted an appeal bond totaling
$7.4&nbsp;million. On January&nbsp;29, 2010, through a formal mediation session, the parties agreed to
settle all of the claims arising out of and related to this lawsuit for $3.5&nbsp;million. As a result
of this settlement, in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company reduced its recorded reserves for
this matter from $5.4&nbsp;million, which represented the initial jury verdict award plus the award for
court costs and attorney fees discussed above, to the $3.5&nbsp;million settlement amount. The parties
are in the process of formalizing the terms of their settlement through a written settlement
agreement and mutual release (the &#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;). Upon execution of the Settlement
Agreement, payment of the settlement amount and dismissal of this lawsuit with prejudice by the
court, the Company will consider this matter closed.

Health Services, Inc. and City of Philadelphia. </I>On or about August&nbsp;2, 2006, plaintiff, an
individual physician independent contractor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a putative class
action suit against PHS and the City of Philadelphia (the &#147;City&#148;) in the Court of Common Pleas of
Philadelphia County, Trial Division, seeking unspecified damages for the class, but damages in the
amount of approximately $10,000 individually. Plaintiff alleges that he provided services to
inmates in the Philadelphia Prison System at the request of the defendants and that the defendants
breached the alleged contractual duties owed to him by paying an amount alleged to be less than the
full amount plaintiff billed for his medical services. On September&nbsp;22, 2006, the City filed a New
Matter Crossclaim against PHS alleging breach of contract, negligence and seeking indemnification.
On September&nbsp;29, 2006, PHS filed its Answer to plaintiff&#146;s complaint, which Answer included a
crossclaim against the City for contribution and indemnification. The plaintiff filed his motion
for class certification on October&nbsp;1, 2007; and PHS and the City responded to this motion. On

PHS believes that the trial court&#146;s ruling denying class certification is sound and will be upheld
on appeal, in the event the appellate court overturns the trial court&#146;s ruling and PHS is not
successful at trial, an adverse judgment could have a material adverse affect on the Company&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Saint Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center v. Correctional Health Services, et al. </I>On or about
February&nbsp;8, 2007, the Company&#146;s subsidiary, CHS, was served with a lawsuit by plaintiff, Saint
Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center (&#147;St. Joseph&#146;s&#148;). Plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court of
New Jersey, Law Division: Passaic County, against CHS, Barnert Hospital, County of Bergen, Bergen
County Jail, County of Essex, Essex County Jail, County of Hudson, Hudson County Jail, County of
Passaic and Passaic County Jail, &#147;John Does #1-30&#148;, &#147;ABC Corporations #1-30&#148;, &#147;XYZ Jails, Prisons
and/or Detention Centers&#148; seeking damages from CHS totaling approximately $2.5&nbsp;million. Plaintiff
claims that CHS failed to administer various contracts with respect to medical claims for the
treatment of certain patients and the payment of such claims between each of the respective
counties and jails named in the complaint and Barnert Hospital, to which St. Joseph&#146;s claims it was
an intended third-party beneficiary. On August&nbsp;15, 2007, Barnert Hospital filed for Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy protection. As a result, the court has stayed the proceedings in the lawsuit pending
resolution of the bankruptcy. CHS intends to defend itself vigorously, and maintains that it is
not responsible for any payments that may be due and owing to the plaintiff. However, a judgment
adverse to CHS could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its
results of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company has no reserves associated with this
proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Matters involving PHS and Baltimore County, Maryland. </I>PHS is currently involved in a
lawsuit with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;) in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of outstanding receivable balances, damages for
breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment as well as prejudgment interest (the
&#147;Collection Matter&#148;). The outstanding receivable balances total approximately $1.7&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and are primarily related to services performed by PHS between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and
September&nbsp;14, 2006 while PHS and the County were jointly seeking a judicial interpretation of a
contract dispute regarding whether the County had timely exercised its renewal options under its
contract with PHS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHS contended that the original term of its contract with the County expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005,
without the County exercising the first of three, two-year renewal options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, PHS
sent a letter to the County stating its position that PHS&#146; contract to provide services expired on
June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s failure to provide such extension notice. The County disputed
PHS&#146; contention asserting that it properly exercised the first renewal option and that the term of
the contract therefore was through June&nbsp;30, 2007, with extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In
July&nbsp;2005, the County and PHS agreed to have a judicial authority interpret the contract through
formal judicial proceedings (the &#147;Contract Matter&#148;). At the written request of the County, PHS
continued to provide healthcare services to the County from July&nbsp;1, 2005 to September&nbsp;14, 2006,
under the terms and conditions of the contested contract, pending the judicial resolution of the
Contract Matter, while reserving all of its rights. Finally, during September&nbsp;2006, amid
reciprocal claims of default, both PHS and the County took individual steps to terminate the
relationship between the parties. PHS contends that it terminated the relationship effective
September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to various breaches by the County, including failure to remit payment of
approximately $1.7&nbsp;million primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and
September&nbsp;14, 2006. On October&nbsp;27, 2006 PHS initiated the Collection Matter lawsuit against the
County.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Collection Matter, although filed, was initially dormant, pending the resolution of the
Contract Matter. As discussed in more detail below, the Contract Matter was resolved in favor of
PHS on August&nbsp;26, 2008, when the Maryland Court of Appeals (the State&#146;s highest appellate court)
denied the County&#146;s request for a review of a Maryland Court of Special Appeals decision in favor
of PHS. After the resolution of the Contract Matter, the parties, during 2009, commenced the
discovery process on the Collection Matter. PHS believes, in the case of the Collection Matter,
that it has a valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the
outstanding receivables, which represent services performed under the relationship between the
parties, are probable of collection. However, although PHS believes it has valid contractual and
legal arguments, an adverse result in the Collection Matter could have a negative impact on PHS&#146;
ability to collect the outstanding receivable amount and result in losses in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, the Contract Matter, mentioned above, was resolved in the following manner. In
November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the County, with
respect to the Contract Matter, ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two-year
renewal option by sending a faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed
this ruling. On December&nbsp;6, 2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this
judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of
July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the case to the Circuit Court to determine whether the County
properly exercised the option by its conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally
decided by the Circuit Court. On May&nbsp;15, 2007, the Circuit Court, upon remand, held a hearing on
the parties&#146; pending cross motions for summary judgment. The Court issued an oral opinion at the
end of the hearing indicating its intention to rule in favor of the County&#146;s motion for summary
judgment and against PHS&#146; motion for summary judgment. On June&nbsp;6, 2007, the Court filed its order
memorializing the aforementioned ruling. In its order, the Court ruled that, by its actions, the
County properly and timely exercised the first two-year renewal option. The Company filed a Notice
of Appeal and on May&nbsp;14, 2008, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals issued its ruling that the
actions the County claimed constituted an exercise of renewal were ineffective. Accordingly, the
Court of Special Appeals reversed the Circuit Court&#146;s ruling and directed it to grant the Company&#146;s
motion for summary judgment in the lawsuit. On June&nbsp;27, 2008, the County petitioned the Maryland
Court of Appeals (the State&#146;s highest appellate court) to review the May&nbsp;14, 2008 Court of Special
Appeals decision. By order dated August&nbsp;26, 2008, the Court of Appeals denied the County&#146;s request
to review the decision, resulting in the ruling of the Court of Special Appeals in favor of the
Company becoming final, thereby bringing closure to the Contract Matter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Matters Related to the Audit Committee Investigation and Shareholder Litigation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company announced that its Audit Committee had concluded its
investigation and reached certain conclusions with respect to findings of the investigation that
resulted in the recording of amounts due to SPP&#146;s customers that were not charged in accordance
with the terms of their respective contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>SEC and United States Attorney Informal Inquiries. </I>As previously reported, the Company
contacted the SEC to inform it of the existence of the internal investigation conducted by the
Audit Committee and the issues being investigated. Since that time, the Company has cooperated with
the SEC in the informal inquiry that it conducted. In November&nbsp;2009, the SEC confirmed that its
informal inquiry has been formally closed without any enforcement action. The SEC further
confirmed it never issued a formal order of investigation or a Wells Notice relating to this
matter. As a result of receiving this confirmation from the SEC, the Company considers this matter
closed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has also cooperated with the Office of the U. S. Attorney for the Middle District
of Tennessee (the &#147;U.S. Attorney&#148;) in an informal inquiry
it conducted. The Company has recently been informed that the U.S.
Attorney has no active investigation against the Company.
 As a result  of receiving this confirmation from the U.S. Attorney, the Company
considers this matter closed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholder Litigation. </I>On April&nbsp;6, 2006, plaintiffs filed the first of four similar
securities class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee against the Company and the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, at that time, and Chief
Financial Officer. Plaintiffs&#146; allegations in these class action lawsuits are substantially
identical and generally allege on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased the
Company&#146;s common stock between September&nbsp;24, 2003 and March&nbsp;16, 2006 that, prior to the Company&#146;s
announcement of the Audit Committee investigation, the Company and/or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive
Officer, at that time, and Chief Financial Officer violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 by making false and misleading statements,
or concealing information about the Company&#146;s business, forecasts and financial performance. The
complaints seek certification as a class action, unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys&#146; fees
and costs, and other relief. By order dated August&nbsp;3, 2006, the district court consolidated the
lawsuits into one consolidated action and on October&nbsp;31, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended complaint
adding SPP, Enoch E. Hartman III and Grant J. Bryson as defendants. Enoch E. Hartman III is a
former employee of the Company and SPP and Grant J. Bryson is a former employee of SPP. The
amended complaint also generally alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements
concerning the Company&#146;s business which caused the Company&#146;s securities to trade at inflated prices
during the class period. Plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of damages in the form of (i)
restitution; (ii)&nbsp;compensatory damages, including interest; and (iii)&nbsp;reasonable costs and
expenses. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on January&nbsp;19, 2007, and the parties
completed the briefs on the motion in May&nbsp;2007. On March&nbsp;31, 2009, the Court ruled on the
defendants&#146; motion to dismiss, granting it in part and denying it in part. While the Court&#146;s
ruling dismissed significant portions of plaintiffs&#146; amended complaint and, as a result, narrowed
the scope of plaintiffs&#146; claims, none of the defendants were dismissed from the case and several of
plaintiffs&#146; claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and
SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 remain. The parties were not in agreement as to the scope of the Court&#146;s order and
defendants filed a motion to confirm which claims the Court dismissed in its March&nbsp;31, 2009 ruling.
The Court granted defendants&#146; motion to confirm the scope of the dismissal order on July&nbsp;20, 2009,
ruling that certain of Plaintiff&#146;s claims had been in fact dismissed. The Court also confirmed,
however, that certain other claims remained viable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;22, 2009, the Court administratively closed the shareholder litigation case, while the
parties pursued mediation of this matter. On February&nbsp;19, 2010, the parties agreed to the terms of
a mediator&#146;s proposal to settle all of the claims in this lawsuit. The settlement, which is
subject to final documentation as well as approval by the Court, provides for payment by the
Company of $10.5&nbsp;million and issuance by the Company of 300,000 shares of common stock and would
lead to a dismissal with prejudice of all claims against all defendants in the litigation. The
preliminary total value of the settlement, based upon the Company&#146;s closing share price for its
common stock of $15.42 per share on February&nbsp;19, 2010, is approximately $15.1&nbsp;million. As such,
the Company has recorded a

consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
The final value of the settlement will be determined based upon the Company&#146;s closing share price at the time of final approval of the settlement by the Court. The settlement
provides for price protection to the plaintiffs in the event the closing share price is below $14.65 per
share at the time of final approval of the settlement by the Court.
In such event, the Company would pay in cash the difference between the share
 value at the time of final approval and $14.65 per share.
The parties are formalizing the terms of the
settlement through a written agreement which will be executed by the parties and presented to the
Court for final approval. Upon final approval of the Court and payment of the settlement amount,
the Company will consider this matter closed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009, the Company and its primary  D&#038;O
carrier reached an agreement under which the Company and the primary D&#038;O carrier mutually released
each other from future claims related to this matter and the primary D&#038;O carrier remitted insurance
proceeds to the Company totaling $8.0&nbsp;million, less approximately $0.4&nbsp;million in legal fees paid
by the primary D&#038;O carrier as of the settlement date. The Company has paid and/or accrued
additional legal fees incurred through December&nbsp;31, 2009, of $0.8&nbsp;million related to this matter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its primary D&#038;O carrier, the Company also maintains D&#038;O insurance with an
excess D&#038;O carrier that provides for additional insurance coverage of up to $5.0&nbsp;million for losses
in excess of $10.0&nbsp;million. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10K, the excess D&#038;O
carrier has denied coverage of this matter.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Delaware Department of Justice Inquiry</I>. On April&nbsp;4, 2006, the Company received a letter
notifying it that the Office of the Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice is conducting
an inquiry into the indirect payment of claims by the Delaware Department of Correction to SPP
beginning in July&nbsp;2002 and ending in the spring of 2005 for pharmaceutical services. There can be
no assurance that the Delaware Department of Justice inquiry will not result in the Company
incurring additional investigation and related expenses; being required to make additional refunds;
incurring criminal, or civil penalties, including the imposition of fines; or being debarred from
pursuing future business in certain jurisdictions. Management of the Company is unable to predict
the effect that any such actions may have on its business, financial condition, results of
operations or stock price. The Company has cooperated and intends to continue to cooperate with
the Delaware Department of Justice during its inquiry.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Matters</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2010, the Company entered into a $4.3&nbsp;million settlement for a matter in which a
law firm representing a former inmate, for whom the Company provided healthcare services, had sent
notice asserting that the Company was responsible for permanent injuries to the inmate. As a
result of this settlement agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded additional
expense totaling $0.7&nbsp;million to increase its reserves related to this matter to $4.3&nbsp;million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Company now considers this matter closed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s business ordinarily results in labor and employment related claims and matters,
actions for professional liability and related allegations of deliberate indifference in the
provision of healthcare and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services.
Therefore, in addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is a party to a multitude of
filed or pending legal and other proceedings incidental to its business. An estimate of the amounts
payable on existing claims for which the liability of the Company is probable and estimable is
included in accrued expenses. The Company is not aware of any unasserted claims that would have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Performance Bonds</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is required under certain contracts to provide a performance bond and may also be
required to post performance bonds for other business reasons. At December
31, 2009, the Company had outstanding performance bonds totaling $16.0&nbsp;million. The performance
bonds are renewed on an annual basis. The Company has letters of credit in the amount of $1.6
million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 that collateralize these performance bonds, reduce availability under
the Company&#146;s credit facility and limit funds available for debt service and working capital. The
Company is also dependant on the financial health of the surety companies that it relies on to
issue its performance bonds. An inability to obtain new or renew existing performance bonds could
result in limitations on the Company&#146;s ability to bid for new or renew existing contracts which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of
operations.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of May&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company has one reportable segment: correctional healthcare services.
Prior to the sale of SPP assets described above, the Company also had a reportable segment for
pharmaceutical distribution services. The correctional healthcare services segment contracts with
state, county and local governmental agencies to provide and/or administer healthcare services to
inmates of prisons and jails. The pharmaceutical distribution services segment, prior to May&nbsp;1,
2007, contracted with federal, state and local governments and certain private entities to
distribute pharmaceuticals and certain medical supplies to inmates of correctional facilities. The
accounting policies of the segments were the same as those described in Note 2. The Company
evaluated segment performance based on each segment&#146;s gross margin without allocation of corporate
selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense or income tax provision (benefit).

or expired correctional healthcare service contracts be eliminated from the ongoing operations of
the Company and classified as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the operations of such
contracts, net of applicable income taxes, have been presented as discontinued operations and prior
period quarterly financial data has been reclassified.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed further in Note 17, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires
share-based compensation awards that qualify as participating securities to be included in basic
earnings per share using the &#147;two class&#148; method. Under this guidance, all outstanding unvested
share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents
are considered participating securities. This guidance became effective for the Company on January
1, 2009 and is being applied retrospectively to all prior-period earnings per share computations.

operations data for 2009 and 2008 (in thousands except per share data). Earnings per share for
each quarter are computed independently of earnings per share for the year. The sum of the
quarterly earnings per share may not equal the earnings per share for the year because of: (i)
transactions affecting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in each quarter;
and (ii)&nbsp;the uneven distribution of earnings during the year. Net income (loss)&nbsp;available to common shareholders for each quarter is computed independently of
net income (loss)&nbsp;available to common shareholders for the year. The sum of the quarterly net
income (loss)&nbsp;available to common shareholders may not equal the net income (loss)&nbsp;available to
common shareholders for the year because of: (i)&nbsp;transactions affecting the weighted average number
of unvested restricted shares outstanding during each quarter; and (ii)&nbsp;in periods (quarterly or
annual) in which the Company has incurred losses from continuing operations, no amounts are
allocated to unvested restricted shares for purposes of calculating net income (loss)&nbsp;available to
common shareholders per common share.
