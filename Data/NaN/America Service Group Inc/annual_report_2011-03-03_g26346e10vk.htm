</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;2, 2011, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger
Agreement&#148;) with Valit&#225;s Health Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Valit&#225;s&#148;), and Whiskey
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Valit&#225;s (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;),
providing for the acquisition of the Company by Valit&#225;s. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the &#147;Merger&#148;), with
the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Valit&#225;s.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the effective time of the Merger (the &#147;Effective Time&#148;), each share of common stock of the
Company that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares held by the Company, Valit&#225;s or any of their respective subsidiaries or shares held by
stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash, without interest (such per share
amount, the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;). As of the Effective Time, all such converted shares of common
stock of the Company shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each issued and outstanding option to purchase shares of Company common stock will vest in
full as of immediately prior to and contingent on the closing of the Merger, and each holder of an
option that has an exercise price per share that is less than the Merger Consideration will be
entitled to receive after the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the excess of the Merger
Consideration over such exercise price per share, in each case multiplied by the number of shares
of Company common stock underlying the option. Additionally, all restricted shares of Company
common stock that are subject to vesting or forfeiture conditions (whether time-based or
performance-based) that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
fully vested immediately prior to and contingent on the closing of the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;Board of Directors&#148;), based on the recommendation of
the disinterested members of the Board of Directors, unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. In connection with such approval,
Oppenheimer &#038; Co. Inc. rendered its opinion to the Board of Directors that, as of the date of the
opinion and subject to the various assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration to be received by the Company&#146;s stockholders is fair, from a financial point of view,
to such stockholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
consummation of the Merger is subject to certain customary
conditions, including, without limitation: (i)&nbsp;the
approval by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock
entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger; (ii)&nbsp;receipt of any required approvals or expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the &#147;HSR
Act&#148;); and (iii)&nbsp;the absence of any law or order prohibiting or otherwise making illegal the
Merger. Moreover, each party&#146;s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to certain other
conditions, including, without limitation: (i)&nbsp;the accuracy of the representations and warranties
made by the other party to the Merger Agreement, subject to customary
materiality qualifiers; and
(ii)&nbsp;the compliance by the other party with its obligations and preclosing covenants thereunder,
subject to customary materiality qualifiers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties. The
Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants, including covenants requiring: (i)&nbsp;each of the
parties to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated; and (ii)&nbsp;the Company
to call and hold a stockholders&#146; meeting at which the Board of Directors will recommend, subject to
certain exceptions based on its fiduciary duties, that the stockholders approve the Merger

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may solicit, initiate and encourage other
proposals to acquire the Company, and provide non-public information and participate in discussions
or negotiations in connection therewith, until 12:00&nbsp;a.m.
(Eastern time) on April 17, 2011 (the
&#147;No-Shop Period Start Date&#148;). Starting on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company will be
subject to customary &#147;no-shop&#148; restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition
proposals from third parties and to provide information to and engage in discussions with third
parties who have not submitted an acquisition proposal to the Company prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date. Until 12:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on May 1, 2011, however, the
Company may continue discussions or negotiations with any &#147;Excluded Party,&#148; which is generally
defined in the Merger Agreement as any party from whom the Company receives an acquisition proposal
prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date that, before the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors, is
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the
Merger Agreement), and which acquisition proposal has not been withdrawn or failed to be a Superior
Proposal or an acquisition proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal for any continuous period of at least five business days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;no-shop&#148; restrictions in the Merger Agreement are also subject to a customary
&#147;fiduciary-out&#148; provision which allows the Company under certain circumstances to provide
information to and participate in discussions with third parties with respect to an unsolicited
alternative acquisition proposal that the Board of Directors has determined is or would reasonably
be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is
required to provide Valit&#225;s with certain information regarding its discussions with third parties,
and under specified circumstances to negotiate in good faith with Valit&#225;s in the event of other
acquisition proposals and/or certain other developments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights in favor of each party,
including rights allowing the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a
Superior Proposal. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances,
the Company will be required to pay to Valit&#225;s a specified fee and to reimburse Valit&#225;s for up to
$2.0&nbsp;million in transaction expenses. For instance, in the event that Valit&#225;s or the Company
exercises its rights to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, the Company will
be required to pay to Valit&#225;s a fee in the amount of $8.0&nbsp;million, plus transaction expenses.
However, if certain terminations result from the Company&#146;s acceptance of a Superior Proposal made
by an Excluded Party, then the fee payable to Valit&#225;s will be reduced to $4.5&nbsp;million, plus
transaction expenses.

$360.0&nbsp;million in senior secured credit facilities, comprised of: (i)&nbsp;a term loan facility of
$285.0&nbsp;million; and (ii)&nbsp;a revolving credit facility of $75.0&nbsp;million. In addition,
funds managed by GSO Capital Partners LP and its affilates (the &#147;Mezzanine Lender&#148; and collectively with the Senior Lenders, the

The final termination date for the commitments under each debt commitment letter is August&nbsp;31,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to May&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company, through its subsidiary Secure Pharmacy Plus, LLC
(&#147;SPP&#148;), was also a distributor of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. The Company is a leading
non-governmental provider and/or administrator of correctional healthcare services in the United
States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;12, 2007, SPP and PHS, as guarantor, entered into an asset purchase agreement with
Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corporation (&#147;Maxor&#148;) whereby SPP agreed to sell certain of its
assets at net book value (the &#147;Transaction&#148;). The closing of the Transaction occurred on May&nbsp;3,
2007, with an effective date as of April&nbsp;30, 2007. The net book value of the assets included in
the Transaction was approximately $3.8&nbsp;million as of April&nbsp;30, 2007, which consisted of
approximately $1.9&nbsp;million in inventory and approximately $2.0&nbsp;million in fixed assets, offset by
approximately $0.1&nbsp;million of liabilities for accrued vacation assumed by Maxor. Additionally, as
a condition to the closing of the Transaction, Maxor and PHS entered into a long-term pharmacy
services agreement (the &#147;Services Agreement&#148;) pursuant to which Maxor became the provider of
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to PHS. The Services Agreement commenced effective May&nbsp;1,
2007 and will remain in effect until October&nbsp;31, 2014 (unless terminated earlier in accordance with
the terms of the Services Agreement). During the term of the Services Agreement, PHS will utilize
Maxor on an exclusive basis to provide pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical supplies to PHS,
except in certain specified situations, including when a PHS client elects or requires PHS to
utilize another pharmacy services provider.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Audit Committee Investigation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;24, 2005, the Company announced that the Audit Committee had initiated an internal
investigation into certain matters related to SPP. As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company
announced that the Audit Committee had concluded its investigation and reached certain conclusions
with respect to findings of the investigation that resulted in an accrual of $3.7&nbsp;million of
aggregate refunds due to customers, including PHS, that were not charged by SPP in accordance with
the terms of the respective contracts. In circumstances where SPP&#146;s incorrect billings resulted in
PHS billing its clients incorrectly, PHS passed the applicable amount through to its clients. This
amount plus associated interest represented management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to
affected customers, based on the results of the Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. As of December
31, 2010, the Company has paid all of these refunds plus associated interest to customers except
for $0.4&nbsp;million which has been tendered for payment to the Delaware Department of Corrections,
which was serviced by a customer of SPP (see Note 21 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial
statements and Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;). The ultimate amounts paid could differ from the
Company&#146;s estimates; however, actual amounts to date have not differed materially from the
estimated amounts. There can be no assurance that the Company, a customer or a third-party,
including a governmental entity, will not assert that additional amounts, which may include
penalties and/or associated interest, are owed to these customers. During the year ended December
31, 2010, the Company recognized additional expense totaling $0.5&nbsp;million relative to this matter
which is primarily due to legal expenses incurred as part of the Company reaching a settlement on
February&nbsp;19, 2010, regarding the shareholder litigation filed against the Company and certain
individual defendants on April&nbsp;6, 2006 and related litigation filed by the Company against one of
its insurance carriers (see Note 21 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and Item&nbsp;3.
&#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Correctional Healthcare Services</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, through PHS and CHS, contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies
to provide and/or administer healthcare services to inmates of prisons and jails. The Company&#146;s
revenues from correctional healthcare services are generated primarily by payments from
governmental entities, none of which are dependent on third party payment sources although they are
dependent on appropriate governmental funding. The Company provides and/or administers a wide
range of on-site healthcare programs, and arranges for and oversees off-site hospitalization and
specialty outpatient care. The hospitalization and specialty outpatient care is performed by third
parties through arrangements with independent doctors and local hospitals. For each of the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, revenues from correctional healthcare services accounted
for 100% of the Company&#146;s healthcare revenues from continuing operations and discontinued
operations combined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s target correctional market consists of state prison systems and county and local
jails. A prison is a facility in which an inmate is incarcerated for an extended period of time
(typically one year or longer). A jail is a facility in which the inmate is held for a shorter
period of time, often while awaiting trial or sentencing. The expected higher inmate turnover in
jails typically requires that healthcare be provided to a much larger number of individual inmates
over time and includes the costs associated with stabilizing and treating whatever health
conditions or injuries are present at the time of initial incarceration. As a result of the higher
number of individual inmate patient encounters and the greater likelihood of previously undiagnosed
acute healthcare needs associated with healthcare in jail settings, the severity and therefore
related costs of treating such patients, particularly with respect to professional liability costs,
are typically greater in jails as opposed to prison systems. Conversely, the costs of chronic
healthcare requirements are generally greater with respect to state prison contracts. State prison
contracts often cover a larger number of facilities and often have longer terms than jail
contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Services Provided and/or Administered. </I>Although the precise type of services to be provided
and/or administered by the Company vary depending on the specific terms of a contract, generally,
the Company&#146;s obligation to provide and/or administer medical services to a particular inmate
begins upon the inmate&#146;s booking into the correctional facility and ends upon the inmate&#146;s release.
In order to reduce costs and provide better care, emphasis is placed upon early identification of
serious injuries or illnesses so that prompt and clinically-effective treatment is commenced.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided and/or administered on-site may include physical and mental health
screening upon intake. Screening includes the compilation of the inmate&#146;s health history and the
identification of any current, chronic or acute healthcare needs. After initial screening,
services provided and/or administered may include regular physical and dental screening and care,
psychiatric care, OB-GYN screening and care and diagnostic testing. Hospitalization is provided
off-site at acute-care hospitals. Sick call is regularly conducted and physicians, nurse
practitioners, physicians&#146; assistants and others are also involved in the delivery of care on a
regular basis. Necessary medications are administered by clinical staff.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided and/or administered off-site may include specialty outpatient
diagnostic testing and care, emergency room care, surgery and hospitalization. This care is
performed by third parties through arrangements with independent doctors and local hospitals. In
addition, the Company provides administrative support services on-site, at regional offices and at
the Company&#146;s headquarters. Administrative support services may include program management,
maintenance of on-site medical records and

credentialing, and clinical program development activities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Company&#146;s correctional contracts require it to staff the facilities it serves with
nurses 24 hours a day. Doctors at the facilities have regular hours and are generally available on
call. In addition, dentists, psychiatrists and other specialists are available on a routine basis
at facilities where correctional contracts cover such services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (&#147;NCCHC&#148;) and the American Correctional
Association (&#147;ACA&#148;) set standards for and offer accreditation to facilities that meet their
respective standards. These standards provide specific guidance related to a service provider&#146;s
operations including administration, personnel, support services such as hospital care, regular
services such as sick call, records management and medical and legal issues. Accreditation with
NCCHC and ACA standards is voluntary and includes many other aspects of the operation of the
correctional facility other than the healthcare component. As such, not all of the Company&#146;s
clients seek this accreditation. For those clients that do request the Company to seek such
accreditation, the Company believes it has a 100% success rate of obtaining and maintaining
accreditation with these organizations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCCHC, an independent not-for-profit organization initially formed by the American Medical
Association, was established to improve the quality of health care in jails, prisons, and juvenile
confinement facilities. NCCHC offers a voluntary health services accreditation program through
external peer review to determine whether correctional institutions meet certain standards in their
provision of health services. NCCHC renders a professional judgment and assists in the improvement
of services provided and/or administered. The ACA, an independent not-for-profit organization, was
established to develop uniformity and industry standards for the operation of correctional
facilities and the provision of inmate healthcare. Accreditation involves an extensive audit and
compliance procedure, and is generally granted for a three-year period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contract Provisions. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions typically fall
into one of three general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee. For fixed
fee contracts, the Company&#146;s revenues are based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service
contract irrespective of inmate population. The Company&#146;s revenues for population-based contracts
are based either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for variances
in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or on a per diem rate multiplied by
the average or actual inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee contracts,
the Company&#146;s revenues are based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a
contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed fee or per diem based upon the
regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts that extend
beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of the Company&#146;s
costs of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. The Company often
bears the risk of increased or unexpected costs, which could result in reduced profits or cause it
to sustain losses when costs are higher than projected. Conversely, the Company will derive
increased profits when costs are lower than projected. Certain contracts also contain financial
penalties when performance and/or staffing criteria are not achieved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Company&#146;s contracts will also include additional provisions that mitigate a
portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in
the majority of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses,
stop-loss provisions, cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of
certain or all off-site service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of
the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically, under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue
under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site
expenses or pharmaceutical costs. While such provisions serve to mitigate the Company&#146;s exposure
to losses resulting from cost fluctuations in the specified cost categories, the Company will still
experience variances in its gross margin percentage on these contracts as the additional revenue
under these contract provisions is typically equal to the additional costs incurred by the Company.
Many contracts contain termination provisions which allow either party to terminate the contract
under agreed-upon notice periods. The ability to terminate a contract serves to mitigate the
Company&#146;s risk related to increasing costs of services being provided.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, contracts accounting for approximately 8.7% of the Company&#146;s
correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December
31, 2010 contain no limits on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to off-site
expenses, catastrophic illnesses or injuries to inmates. However, none of these contracts has
longer than one year remaining without a termination provision.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when preparing bid proposals, the Company estimates the extent of its exposure to
cost increases, severe individual cases and catastrophic events and attempts to compensate for its
exposure in the pricing of its bids. The Company&#146;s management has experience in evaluating these
risks for bidding purposes and maintains an extensive database of historical experience.
Nonetheless, increased or unexpected costs against which the Company is not protected could render
a contract unprofitable. Furthermore, in an effort to manage risk under contracts that contain no
limits on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to off-site expenses, catastrophic
illnesses or injuries to inmates, the Company typically maintains stop loss insurance from an
unaffiliated insurer with

policy) for amounts in excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate

the lesser of billed charges, the amount paid or the contracted amounts in situations where the
Company has negotiated rates with the applicable providers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average length of a contract for services is generally one to three years, with subsequent
renewal options. In general, contracts may be terminated by the governmental agency, and often by
the Company as well, without cause at any time upon proper notice. The required notice period for
such contracts ranges from one day to six months, but is typically between 60 and 120&nbsp;days.
Governmental agencies may be subject to political or financial influences that could lead to
termination of a contract through no fault of the Company. As with other governmental contracts,
the Company&#146;s contracts are subject to adequate budgeting and appropriation of funds by the
governing legislature or administrative body.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Administrative Systems. </I>The Company has centralized administrative systems in order to
enhance economies of scale and to provide management with accurate, up-to-date field data for
forecasting purposes. These systems also enable the Company to refine its bids and help the
Company reduce the costs associated with the delivery of consistent healthcare.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a utilization review system to monitor the extent and duration of most
healthcare services required by inmates on an inpatient and outpatient basis. The current
automated utilization review program is an integral part of the services provided and/or
administered at each facility. The system is designed to ensure that the medical care rendered is
medically necessary and is provided safely in a clinically appropriate setting while maintaining
traditional standards of quality of care. The system provides for determinations of medical
necessity by medical professionals through a process of pre-authorization and concurrent review of
the appropriateness of any hospital stay. The system seeks to identify the maximum capability of
on-site healthcare units to allow for a more timely discharge from the hospital back to the
correctional facility. The utilization review staff consists of doctors and nurses who are
supported by medical directors at the regional and corporate levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed a variety of customized databases to facilitate and improve
operational review including (i)&nbsp;a claims management tracking system that monitors current
outpatient charges and inpatient stays, (ii)&nbsp;a comprehensive cost review system that analyzes the
Company&#146;s average costs per inmate at each facility, which includes pharmaceutical utilization and
trend analysis available from Maxor, and (iii)&nbsp;a daily operating report to manage inpatient stays.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bid Process. </I>Contracts with governmental agencies are obtained primarily through a
competitive bidding process, which is governed by applicable state and local statutes and
ordinances. Although practices vary, typically a formal request for proposal (&#147;RFP&#148;), or similar
request or invitation, is issued by the governmental agency, stating the scope of work to be
performed, length of contract, performance bonding requirements, minimum qualifications of bidders,
selection criteria and the format to be followed in the bid or proposal. Usually, a committee
appointed by the governmental agency reviews bids and makes an award determination. The committee
may award the contract to a particular bidder or decide not to award the contract. Typically, the
committee considers a number of factors, including the technical quality of the proposal, the bid
price and the reputation of the bidder for providing quality care. The award of a contract may be
subject to formal or informal protest by unsuccessful bidders through a governmental appeals
process. If the committee does not award a contract, the correctional agency may, among various
options, continue to provide healthcare services to its inmates with its own personnel or the
existing provider.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contractual and Regulatory Compliance. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with governmental agencies
often require it to comply with numerous additional requirements regarding record-keeping and
accounting, non-discrimination in the hiring of personnel, safety, safeguarding confidential
information, management qualifications, professional licensing requirements, emergency healthcare
needs of corrections employees and other matters. If a violation of the terms of an applicable
contractual or statutory provision occurs, a contractor may be debarred or suspended from obtaining
future contracts for specified periods of time in the applicable location. The Company has never
been debarred or suspended from seeking procurements in any jurisdiction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Marketing. </I>The Company gathers, monitors and analyzes relevant information on potential jail
and prison systems which meet predefined new business criteria. These criteria include facility
size, location, revenue and margin potential and exposure to risk. The Company then devotes the
necessary resources in securing new business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes it is one of the largest private providers of healthcare services to
county/municipal jails and detention centers in the United States. The Company will continue to
focus its business development efforts on those facilities where stabilization and treatment of the
population is the primary mission. The Company will also continue to pursue certain opportunities
at state prison systems, where in many cases, services are provided to a larger system with a more
permanent population. Due to the more permanent population at the state prison facilities, the
primary healthcare mission shifts to disease management and treatment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a staff of sales and marketing representatives assigned to specific
projects, geographic areas or markets. In addition, the Company uses consultants, from time to

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services provided and/or administered by the Company require an experienced staff of
healthcare professionals and facilities administrators. In particular, a nursing staff with
experience in correctional healthcare and specialized skills in all necessary areas contributes
significantly to the Company&#146;s ability to provide efficient service. In addition to nurses, the
Company&#146;s staff of employees and independent contractors includes physicians, dentists,
psychologists and other healthcare professionals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company had approximately 3,290 employees, including
approximately 191 doctors and 1,516 nurses. The Company also utilizes approximately 1,204
independent contractors, including physicians, dentists, psychiatrists, psychologists and other
healthcare professionals. Of the Company&#146;s employees, approximately 507 are represented by labor
unions. The Company believes that its employee relations are good.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental entities is highly
fragmented and competitive with few barriers to entry. The Company is in direct competition with
local, regional and national correctional healthcare providers including certain state medical
schools and other state or municipal organizations. The Company estimates that it currently has
approximately 6% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on its estimates of
national aggregate annual expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its primary
competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates currently has
approximately 7% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, and Correct Care Solutions,
LLC and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., which the Company estimates each currently have approximately
2% of such market. The market share estimates shown above for the Company reflect its contracts
currently in place. The market share estimates shown above for Correctional Medical Services,
Correct Care Solutions, LLC and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., reflect the Company&#146;s estimate of contracts currently held by these
competitors. As the private market for providing correctional healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s
competitors may gain additional experience in bidding and administering correctional healthcare
contracts. In addition, new competitors, some of whom may have extensive experience in related
fields or greater financial resources than the Company, may enter the market.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Governmental Regulations and Court Orders. </I>The industry in which the Company operates is
subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations and/or orders of judicial authorities,
including healthcare, pharmaceutical and safety regulations and judicial orders, decrees and
judgments. Some of the regulations and orders are unique to the Company&#146;s industry, and the
combination of regulations and orders it faces is unique. Generally, prospective providers of
healthcare services to correctional facilities must be able to comply with a variety of applicable
state and local regulations and judicial orders. The Company&#146;s contracts typically include
reporting requirements as well as, supervision and on-site monitoring by representatives of the
contracting governmental agencies or courts. In addition, the Company&#146;s doctors, nurses and other
healthcare professionals who provide services on its behalf are in most cases required to obtain
and maintain professional licenses and are subject to state regulation regarding professional
standards of conduct. The Company&#146;s services are also subject to operational and financial audits
by the governmental agencies with which the Company has contracts and by the courts of competent
jurisdiction. The Company may not always successfully comply with these regulations or court
orders and failure to comply can result in material penalties, or non-renewal or termination of
contracts with correctional facilities, or prohibition from proposing for new business in certain
jurisdictions.

Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(&#147;HIPAA&#148;) require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims
and payment transactions (&#147;standard transactions&#148;) submitted or received electronically. These
provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. Beginning
January&nbsp;28, 2010, the Company began conducting certain standard transactions electronically. As a
result, the Company became a HIPAA covered entity and is subject to applicable HIPAA regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIPAA includes extensive privacy and security regulations governing the use and disclosure of
protected health information by health care providers, health care plans and health care
clearinghouses (&#147;covered entities&#148;) and requires covered entities to implement administrative,
physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. The American
Recovery and Investment Act of 2009 (&#147;ARRA&#148;) expanded the scope of the HIPAA privacy and security
regulations. ARRA increases civil penalties for violations of HIPAA and broadens the applicability
of criminal penalties to employees of covered entities. ARRA also strengthens enforcement of HIPAA
by requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to conduct periodic audits and
authorizes state attorney generals to bring civil actions seeking injunctions or damages in
response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state
residents. In addition to HIPAA, most states have enacted laws governing the use and disclosure
of patient health information These state laws supersede HIPAA to the extent they are more
restrictive than the privacy and security standards in HIPAA. The Company has in place a HIPAA
compliance plan which is enforced and monitored for compliance by our privacy and security
officers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting</I>. Many of the states in which the Company
operates have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations,
from employing physicians or laws that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments or
fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities.
Possible sanctions for violations of these laws include loss of a physician&#146;s license, civil and
criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements that may violate these restrictions.
These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and seldom have been interpreted by the
courts or regulatory agencies. The Company reviews, on an ongoing basis, the applicable laws in
each state in which the Company operates and reviews its arrangements with its healthcare providers
to ensure that these arrangements comply with all applicable laws. The Company can provide no
assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that the
Company, or transactions in which it is involved, are in violation of such laws, or that such laws
ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with the Company&#146;s
interpretations.

December&nbsp;31, 2010. The Company&#146;s contract to provide prisoner health care services to prisoners
under the care of the State of Michigan Department of Corrections accounted for approximately 17.1%
of the total healthcare revenues from continuing and discontinued operations combined for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. No other contract accounted for 10% or more of such revenues during the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. Summaries of the Company&#146;s three largest contracts

contract with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (&#147;NYCDOH&#148;) to provide
management and administrative services with respect to the provision of comprehensive medical,
mental health, dental and ancillary services to inmates in the custody of the New York City
Department of Correction. The three-year &#147;cost plus fixed fee&#148; contract commenced on January&nbsp;1,
2005 and was renewed, effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2008 (the &#147;Renewal Agreement&#148;). Pursuant to the
Renewal Agreement, PHS, through arrangements with professional service corporations, who are also
parties to the Renewal Agreement, administered the provision of comprehensive medical, mental
health, dental and ancillary services to inmates in the custody of the New York City Department of
Correction. The renewed &#147;cost plus fixed fee&#148; contract had a term of three years ending on
December&nbsp;31, 2010. Pursuant to the Renewal Agreement, PHS was subject to mandatory staffing and
other performance requirements. Additionally, NYCDOH was required to indemnify PHS and the
professional service corporations and their respective employees for damages for personal injuries
and/or death alleged to have been sustained by an inmate by reason of malpractice, except where PHS
or the professional service corporations or their respective employees had engaged in intentional
misconduct or a criminal act.

1, 2011 for PHS to provide administrative services related to the provision of comprehensive
medical, mental health, dental and ancillary services to inmates in the custody of the New York
City Department of Correction. The new contract with NYCDOH has substantially the same contract provisions as

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections. </I>The Company, through PHS, entered
into a contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections (&#147;Pennsylvania
DOC&#148;) on September&nbsp;1, 2003, for a period of five years for medical services exclusive of mental
health and pharmacy. On January&nbsp;31, 2008, PHS and the Pennsylvania DOC entered into Contract
Modification Agreement No.&nbsp;3 to the current contract, which extended the current contract with
Pennsylvania DOC for a period of five additional years through August&nbsp;31, 2013. The contract
covers each of the 27 Pennsylvania state prison system facilities. The Pennsylvania DOC pays the
Company a flat rate per month, which is adjusted for changes in inmate population levels. Under
the terms of the contract, the Company is reimbursed for the costs of the medical malpractice
insurance related to this contract and its exposure to off-site medical costs related to this
contract is limited to a specified maximum amount. Pharmacy and mental health services are
provided by separate contractors to the Pennsylvania DOC. The Pennsylvania DOC may terminate the
contract on six months&#146; notice. The Company may terminate the contract without cause subject to
delivery of nine months notice to the Pennsylvania DOC.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Michigan Department of Corrections. </I>On February&nbsp;10, 2009, the Company, through PHS, and the
State of Michigan entered into a three-year contract under which PHS will provide prisoner health
care services to prisoners under the care of the State of Michigan Department of Corrections (the
&#147;Michigan Contract&#148;). PHS began providing prisoner health care services under the Michigan
Contract on April&nbsp;1, 2009. Compensation payable to PHS under the Michigan Contract is based on a
fixed per prisoner per month rate that will be adjusted for changes in monthly average prisoner
population and annually for inflation. Compensation is also subject to adjustment in accordance
with the risk-sharing terms described in the Michigan Contract. After its initial three-year term,
the Michigan Contract may be renewed for up to four additional one-year periods by mutual, written
agreement of the parties not less than 30&nbsp;days before the expiration of the then current term.
Under the terms of the Michigan Contract, the State of Michigan may terminate the Michigan Contract
for cause if PHS (i)&nbsp;breaches any of its material duties or obligations under the Michigan
Contract, or (ii)&nbsp;fails to cure a breach within the time period specified in the written notice of
breach provided by the State of Michigan. In addition, the State of Michigan may terminate the
Michigan Contract if it determines that a termination is in its best interest. PHS has also agreed
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the State of Michigan from liability for injuries or damages
that are attributable to the negligence or tortious acts of PHS, its employees, agents or
subcontractors in its performance of the Michigan Contract.

approval and the performance of the parties to the Merger Agreement. </I>As discussed in Part 1. &#151;
Item&nbsp;1. &#147;Business &#151; Significant Recent Development&#148;, on March&nbsp;2, 2011, the Company entered into
the Merger Agreement. Management of the Company is unable to predict
what effect the Merger may have on
its business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The material factors that
could have an effect on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, results of operations or stock
price include, without limitation, the following: (1)&nbsp;the inability to complete the Merger in a
timely manner; (2)&nbsp;the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain stockholder
approval or the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the Merger, including
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act; (3)&nbsp;the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to
the termination of the Merger Agreement; (4)&nbsp;the failure to obtain the necessary debt financing
arrangements set forth in the commitment letters received by Valit&#225;s in connection with the Merger
Agreement; (5)&nbsp;the impact of the substantial indebtedness incurred to finance the consummation of
the Merger; (6)&nbsp;the possibility that competing offers will be made; (7)&nbsp;the effect of the
announcement of the transaction on the Company&#146;s business relationships, operating results and
business generally, either before or after the consummation of the transaction; (8)&nbsp;diversion of
management&#146;s attention from ongoing business concerns as a result of the pendency or consummation

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company has paid refunds to customers and may be required to pay, or incur expenses
investigating claims of, additional refunds. </I>As a result of the internal investigation described
in Item&nbsp;1. &#147;Business &#151; Audit Committee Investigation,&#148; the Audit Committee determined that, in
certain instances, SPP did not charge its customers in accordance with applicable contracts. As a
result, the Company recorded accruals to provide aggregate refunds to customers of approximately
$3.7&nbsp;million, covering all periods since the Company&#146;s acquisition of SPP in September&nbsp;2000, plus
interest at the applicable federal rate (which ranged from 4% to 9%) during the period covered by
the investigation. These amounts represented management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to
affected customers based on the Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. However, the Company can provide
no assurance that a customer or a third-party, including a governmental entity, will not assert
that additional amounts, which may include penalties, are owed to these customers and, that as a
result of such assertions, the Company will not incur additional investigation and related expenses
or be required to make additional refunds.

subject of additional government investigations, enforcement actions or penalties in the future,
any of which could adversely affect the Company. </I>The Company could be the subject of future
government investigations, enforcement actions or penalties. As previously and currently
disclosed, the Company was the subject of a informal inquiry by the SEC as it related to the Audit
Committee investigation. However, in November&nbsp;2009, the SEC confirmed that its informal inquiry
has been formally closed without any enforcement action. The SEC further confirmed it never issued
a formal order of investigation or a Wells Notice relating to this matter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was also the subject of an informal inquiry by the U.S. Attorney for the Middle
District of Tennessee (the &#147;U.S. Attorney&#148;) with respect to those matters that were the subject of
the Audit Committee&#146;s internal investigation. The Company was informed in early 2010 that the U.S.
Attorney has no active investigation against the Company. In addition, the Company has received
notice from the Delaware Department of Justice, Office of Attorney General that it is conducting an
inquiry into the indirect payment of claims by the Delaware Department of Correction to SPP for
pharmaceutical services (see Note 21 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and Item&nbsp;3.
&#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;). Both the Audit Committee and the Company have cooperated and intend to
continue to cooperate fully with the Delaware Attorney General regarding its inquiry. However,
there can be no assurance that the U.S. Attorney and the Delaware Attorney General or any other
governmental authority (including, without limitation, the governmental entities with which the
Company entered into contractual relationships) will not take any action that would adversely
affect the Company as a result of the matters investigated by the Audit Committee. Such actions
could result in criminal, civil or other penalties, including the imposition of fines, the
termination of existing contracts, the debarment from pursuing future business in certain
jurisdictions or additional restatements of the Company&#146;s financial statements. Management of the
Company is unable to predict the effect that any such actions may have on its business, financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows or stock price.

and certain of its executive officers were named defendants in a shareholder class action lawsuit
(see Note 21 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;).
The Company and its current or former directors or officers could be named defendants in future
shareholder class actions and could be required to pay damages in excess of the coverage of its
directors and officers liability insurance in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company&#146;s revenue depends on client contracts that are generally terminable without cause
and termination of contracts accounting for a significant portion of its revenue could adversely
affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. </I>The Company&#146;s operating
revenue is derived almost exclusively from contracts with state, county and local governmental
agencies. Generally, contracts may be terminated by the governmental agency without cause upon
proper notice (typically between 60 and 120&nbsp;days). Governmental agencies may be subject to
political or financial influences, including governmental budgetary concerns, that could lead to
termination of a contract or failure to renew or extend a contract through no fault of the Company.
Although the Company generally attempts to renew or renegotiate contracts at or prior to their
termination, contracts that are put out for bid are subject to intense competition. As a result,
the Company&#146;s portfolio of contracts is subject to change. The changes in the Company&#146;s portfolio
of contracts are largely unpredictable, which creates uncertainties about the amount of its total
revenues from period to period. The Company must engage in competitive bidding for new business to
replace contracts that expire or are terminated. The Company, therefore, can provide no assurance
that it will be able to replace contracts that expire or are terminated or are not renewed on
favorable terms or otherwise. The non-renewal or termination, or renewal on unfavorable terms, of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company relies on a small number of client contracts for a significant
portion of its revenues. The combined revenues of the Company&#146;s Rikers Island, New York,
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections and State of Michigan Department of
Corrections contracts accounted for approximately 50.9% of the total healthcare revenues from
continuing and discontinued operations combined for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. The loss of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company&#146;s cash flow depends on timely payment and any delay or failure of its clients to
make payments could adversely affect its results of operations or cash flows. </I>The Company&#146;s cash
flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of, and timely payment by, the governmental
entities with which it contracts. Economic circumstances at the national, state or local level
could affect governmental entity budgets, which could result in insufficient funding, increased
pricing pressure or termination of contracts. In addition, federal, state and local governments
are constantly under pressure to control additional spending or reduce current levels of spending.
Accordingly, if a governmental entity does not receive sufficient or timely funding to cover its
obligations under a healthcare services contract, the contract may be terminated and payment for
the Company&#146;s services could be delayed or not occur. The termination of contracts, a significant
delay in payment or non-payment could adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows.

healthcare services and it can provide no assurances that such further privatization will occur.</I>
The Company&#146;s future revenue growth depends, in part, on continued privatization by state, county
and local governmental agencies of healthcare services for correctional facilities. The Company
believes, based on marketplace information and internal estimates that no significant annualized
correctional healthcare contract revenues were newly privatized in 2010 by governmental agencies
either for the first time or as a result of the expansion of existing contracted services to
encompass additional or expanded services. There can be no assurance that this market will
continue to grow or that existing contracts will continue to be made available to the private
sector. Revenue growth could also be adversely affected by material decreases in the inmate
population of correctional facilities. Any of these results could cause the Company&#146;s revenue to
decline and harm its business and operating results.

regarding the provision of correctional healthcare services by for-profit companies, including the

Company&#146;s results of operations or business. Privatization of healthcare services for correctional
facilities may encounter resistance from groups or constituencies that believe that healthcare
services to correctional facilities should only be provided by governmental agencies. Negative
publicity regarding the privatization of correctional healthcare services or specific alleged
actions or inactions of the Company or other industry participants may result in increased
regulation and legislative review of industry practices that further increase the Company&#146;s costs

result in reduced reimbursements from its clients, refunds to its clients or civil or criminal
penalties. </I>Certain of the governmental agencies with which the Company contracts have the
authority to audit and investigate its contracts with them. As part of that process, governmental
agencies may review the Company&#146;s performance of the contract, its pricing practices, its cost
structure and its compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. For contracts that
actually or effectively provide for certain reimbursement of expenses, if an agency determines that
the Company has improperly allocated costs to a specific contract, it may not be reimbursed for
those costs, and it could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been
reimbursed. If a government audit asserts improper or illegal activities by the Company, it may be
subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of
contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or disqualification
from doing business with certain governmental entities. Any adverse determination could adversely
impact the Company&#146;s ability to bid in response to RFPs in one or more jurisdictions and could have

result of any governmental agency investigations and/or audits, the Company&#146;s collections of

and operating results. </I>The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental
agencies is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. The Company is in direct competition
with local, regional and national correctional healthcare providers, including certain state
medical schools and other state or municipal organizations. The Company estimates that it
currently has approximately 6% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on its
estimates of national aggregate annual expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its
primary competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates currently has
approximately 7% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, and Correct Care Solutions,
LLC and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., which the Company estimates both currently have approximately
2% of such market. The market share estimates shown above for the Company reflect its contracts
currently in place. The market share estimates shown above for
Correctional Medical Services, Correct Care Solutions, LLC and
Wexford Health Sources, Inc., reflect the Company&#146;s estimate of contracts currently held by these
competitors. As the private market for providing correctional healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s
competitors may gain additional experience in bidding and administering correctional healthcare
contracts. In addition, new competitors, some of whom may have extensive experience in related
fields or greater financial resources than the Company, may enter the market. Increased
competition could result in a loss of contracts and market share, or less favorable contract terms,
and could seriously harm the Company&#146;s business and operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company&#146;s growth strategy in part depends on its ability to identify, fund and integrate
any future acquisitions and no assurances can be made that it will do so successfully. </I>The
Company&#146;s expansion strategy involves both internal growth and, as opportunities become available,
acquisitions. The inability to identify, fund and successfully integrate future acquisitions may
significantly reduce the Company&#146;s potential growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts expose it to costs related to catastrophic events, and
therefore any such event could adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition or results of
operations. </I>At December&nbsp;31, 2010, contracts accounting for approximately 8.7% of the Company&#146;s
correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December
31, 2010 contain no limits on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to catastrophic
illnesses or injuries to inmates. Although the Company attempts to compensate for the increased
financial risk when pricing contracts that do not contain catastrophic limits there can be no
assurance that the Company will not experience a catastrophic illness or injury of a patient that
exceeds its coverage in the future. The occurrence of severe individual cases outside of the
catastrophic limits contained in the Company&#146;s insurance coverage could render contracts
unprofitable and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and

profitability. The Company competes with other healthcare and service providers in recruiting
qualified management and staff personnel for the day-to-day operations of its business, including
nurses and other healthcare professionals. In some markets, the scarcity of physicians, nurses and
other medical support personnel is a significant operating issue to healthcare businesses. This
scarcity may require the Company to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified
nurses and other healthcare professionals. Because a significant percentage of the Company&#146;s
existing contracts are structured as fixed fee and/or population based contracts, the Company&#146;s
ability to pass along increased labor costs is limited. If the Company is not successful in
attracting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified healthcare personnel in the future, it
may not be able to perform under its contracts, which could lead to the loss of existing contracts
or its ability to obtain new contracts. Moreover, lack of success in this area could further
result in the provision of negligent healthcare services or in the provision of untimely healthcare
services, or in the allegation of such negligent or untimely services (whether valid or invalid),
any or all of which could increase the Company&#146;s exposure to professional, medical, pharmaceutical
or other liability expenses. Additionally, approximately 47% of the Company&#146;s contracts contain
financial penalties that apply when performance or staffing criteria are not achieved. For the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company incurred revenue deductions related to these criteria
totaling approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, or less than 1% of the Company&#146;s total healthcare revenues
from continuing operations and discontinued operations combined. Failure to attract qualified
management and staff personnel for the day-to-day operations of the Company&#146;s business could
materially adversely affect the Company&#146;s business and operating results.

provide no assurances that adequate levels of liability insurance will continue to be available or
that it will not be exposed to claims in excess of its insurance coverage. </I>The Company&#146;s business
ordinarily results in the Company becoming involved in actions for medical malpractice and other
claims related to the provision of healthcare services with the attendant risk of substantial
damage awards, or court endorsed non-monetary relief such as changes in operating practices or
procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in the Company&#146;s operating
expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits
brought by inmates (or their successors) alleging negligent healthcare services or the lack of
timely adequate healthcare services. The Company may also be liable, as employer, for the
negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or healthcare professionals or entities with whom
it contracts. All but one of the Company&#146;s contracts generally provides for the Company to
indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the Company
and its agents. The Company maintains professional and general liability insurance; however, due
to the use of adjustable premium policies in 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2010, with respect
to a majority of its patients, the Company is effectively self-insured for professional liability
claims incurred under its primary program. For 2007, the Company is insured through a claims made
policy subject to per event and aggregate coverage limits. Any amounts ultimately incurred above
the coverage limits contained in the Company&#146;s professional and general liability insurance
policies would be the responsibility of the Company. In addition to its primary program, the
Company also has traditional risk transfer insurance policies that relate to certain specific
healthcare services contracts. Many of the Company&#146;s independent contractors maintain professional
liability insurance in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon the Company&#146;s claims
history and the nature and risks of its business. The Company indemnifies and pays for such
coverage for some of its independent contractors. Management establishes reserves for the
estimated losses that will be incurred under these insurance policies after taking into
consideration the Company&#146;s professional liability claims department and external counsel
evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis of claim history, actuarial analysis
and coverage limits where applicable. However, there can be no assurance that a future claim or
claims will not exceed management&#146;s loss estimates or the limits of available insurance coverage,
the result of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

insured at certain levels. Failure to obtain sufficient levels of professional liability insurance

expose the Company to significant financial or contractual losses, which could have a material

significantly tighter credit markets. As a result of these conditions, the cost and availability
of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected in the United States. Concern about
the stability of the markets, generally, and the strength of numerous financial institutions,
specifically, has led many lenders to reduce, and in some cases, cease, to provide funding to
borrowers. If these market and economic conditions continue, they may limit the Company&#146;s ability
to borrow money from CapitalSource Bank or other lenders. If the Company is unable to borrow
sufficient amounts of money to fund its capital requirements, its financial condition, business and

insurance coverage for these policy periods, the Company was required to prepay insurance premiums
to its third party insurance carrier, which are held by the third party insurance carrier to pay
valid claims made under the policies in the same or subsequent years. For the 2007 professional

financial position and/or liquidity of one of these third party insurance carriers were to become
impaired such that the third party insurer was unable to pay claims or meet its contractual
obligations to the Company, the Company could lose all or a portion of its prepaid premiums to such

macroeconomic conditions globally continue to be challenging and the Company cannot be certain of
the duration of these conditions and their potential impact on its stock price performance. If a

reasonably estimated, the Company records an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the
litigation. However, it is difficult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range
of loss in some instances because litigation is subject to significant uncertainties. It is
possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be
materially affected by changes in assumptions, new developments or changes in approach, such as a

Philadelphia County, Trial Division, seeking unspecified damages for the class, but damages in the
amount of approximately $10,000 individually. Plaintiff alleges that he provided services to
inmates in the Philadelphia Prison System at the request of the defendants and that the defendants
breached the alleged contractual duties owed to him by paying an amount alleged to be less than the
full amount plaintiff billed for his medical services. On September&nbsp;22, 2006, the City filed a New
Matter Crossclaim against PHS alleging breach of contract, negligence and seeking indemnification.
On September&nbsp;29, 2006, PHS filed its Answer to plaintiff&#146;s complaint, which Answer included a
crossclaim against the City for contribution and indemnification. The plaintiff filed his motion
for class certification on October&nbsp;1, 2007; and PHS and the City responded to this motion. On
January&nbsp;16, 2009, the trial court denied the plaintiff&#146;s motion for class certification. In May
2010, the superior court upheld the denial for class certification. In October&nbsp;2010, the trial
court issued an order closing the case. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company has no reserves
associated with this proceeding and considers this matter closed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Saint Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center v. Correctional Health Services, et al. </I>On or about
February&nbsp;8, 2007, CHS, was served with a lawsuit by plaintiff, Saint
Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center (&#147;St. Joseph&#146;s&#148;). Plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court of
New Jersey, Law Division: Passaic County, against CHS, Barnert Hospital, County of Bergen, Bergen
County Jail, County of Essex, Essex County Jail, County of Hudson, Hudson County Jail, County of
Passaic and Passaic County Jail, &#147;John Does #1-30&#148;, &#147;ABC Corporations #1-30&#148;, &#147;XYZ Jails, Prisons
and/or Detention Centers&#148; seeking damages from CHS totaling approximately $2.5&nbsp;million. Plaintiff
claims that CHS failed to administer various contracts with respect to medical claims for the
treatment of certain patients and the payment of such claims between each of the respective
counties and jails named in the complaint and Barnert Hospital, to which St. Joseph&#146;s claims it was
an intended third-party beneficiary. On August&nbsp;15, 2007, Barnert Hospital filed for Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy protection. As a result, the court has stayed the proceedings in the lawsuit pending
resolution of the bankruptcy. CHS intends to defend itself vigorously, and maintains that it is
not responsible for any payments that may be due and owing to the plaintiff. However, a judgment
adverse to CHS could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its
results of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company has no reserves associated with this
proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Matters involving PHS and Baltimore County, Maryland. </I>PHS is currently involved in a lawsuit
with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;) in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of outstanding receivable balances, damages for
breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment as well as prejudgment interest (the
&#147;Collection Matter&#148;). The outstanding receivable balances total approximately $1.7&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and are primarily related to services performed by PHS between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and
September&nbsp;14, 2006 while PHS and the County were jointly seeking a judicial interpretation of a
contract dispute regarding whether the County had timely exercised its first renewal option under
its contract with PHS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHS contended that the original term of its contract with the County expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005,
without the County exercising the first of three, two-year renewal options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, PHS
sent a letter to the County stating its position that PHS&#146; contract to provide services expired on
June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s failure to provide such extension notice. The County disputed
PHS&#146; contention asserting that it properly exercised the first renewal option and that the term of
the contract therefore was through June&nbsp;30, 2007, with extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In
July&nbsp;2005, the County and PHS agreed to have a judicial authority interpret the contract through
formal judicial proceedings (the &#147;Contract Matter&#148;). At the written request of the County, PHS
continued to provide healthcare services to the County from July&nbsp;1, 2005 to September&nbsp;14, 2006,
under the terms and conditions of the contested contract, pending the judicial resolution of the
Contract Matter, while reserving all of its rights. Finally, during September&nbsp;2006, amid
reciprocal claims of default, both PHS and the County took individual steps to terminate the
relationship between the parties. PHS contends that it terminated the relationship effective
September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to various breaches by the County, including failure to remit payment of
approximately $1.7&nbsp;million primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and
September&nbsp;14, 2006. On October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS initiated the Collection Matter lawsuit against the
County.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Collection Matter, although filed, was initially dormant, pending the resolution of the
Contract Matter. As discussed in more detail below, the Contract Matter was resolved in favor of
PHS on August&nbsp;26, 2008, when the Maryland Court of Appeals (the State&#146;s highest appellate court)
denied the County&#146;s request for a review of a Maryland Court of Special Appeals decision in favor
of PHS. After the resolution of the Contract Matter, the parties, during 2009, commenced the
discovery process on the Collection Matter. On March&nbsp;30, 2010, the court held a scheduling
conference in which the judge set February&nbsp;8, 2011 as the trial date for the Collection Matter.
Prior to the trial date, preliminary settlement discussions were conducted without resolution.
Subsequently, the parties agreed to forego the trial and resolve the Collection Matter through
binding arbitration which is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2011. PHS believes,
in the case of the Collection Matter, that it has a valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a
result, has

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">concluded that the outstanding receivables, which represent services performed under the
relationship between the parties, continues to be probable of collection. However, although PHS
believes it has valid contractual and legal arguments, an adverse result in the Collection Matter
could have a negative impact on PHS&#146; ability to collect the outstanding receivable amount and
result in losses in future periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
2008, the Contract Matter, mentioned above, was resolved in the following manner. In
November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the County, with
respect to the Contract Matter, ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two-year
renewal option by sending a faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed
this ruling. On December&nbsp;6, 2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this
judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of
July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the case to the Circuit Court to determine whether the County
properly exercised the option by its conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally
decided by the Circuit Court. On May&nbsp;15, 2007, the Circuit Court, upon remand, held a hearing on
the parties&#146; pending cross motions for summary judgment. The Court issued an oral opinion at the
end of the hearing indicating its intention to rule in favor of the County&#146;s motion for summary
judgment and against PHS&#146; motion for summary judgment. On June&nbsp;6, 2007, the Court filed its order
memorializing the aforementioned ruling. In its order, the Court ruled that, by its actions, the
County properly and timely exercised the first two-year renewal option. The Company filed a Notice
of Appeal and on May&nbsp;14, 2008, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals issued its ruling that the
actions the County claimed constituted an exercise of renewal were ineffective. Accordingly, the
Court of Special Appeals reversed the Circuit Court&#146;s ruling and directed it to grant the Company&#146;s
motion for summary judgment in the lawsuit. On June&nbsp;27, 2008, the County petitioned the Maryland
Court of Appeals (the State&#146;s highest appellate court) to review the May&nbsp;14, 2008 Court of Special
Appeals decision. By order dated August&nbsp;26, 2008, the Court of Appeals denied the County&#146;s request
to review the decision, resulting in the ruling of the Court of Special Appeals in favor of the
Company becoming final, thereby bringing closure to the Contract Matter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Matters Related to the Audit Committee Investigation and Shareholder Litigation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company announced that its Audit Committee had concluded
its investigation and reached certain conclusions with respect to findings of the investigation
that resulted in the recording of amounts due to SPP&#146;s customers that were not charged in
accordance with the terms of their respective contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholder Litigation. </I>On April&nbsp;6, 2006, plaintiffs filed the first of four similar
securities class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee against the Company and the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, at that time, and Chief
Financial Officer. Plaintiffs&#146; allegations in these class action lawsuits were substantially
identical and generally alleged on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased the
Company&#146;s common stock between September&nbsp;24, 2003 and March&nbsp;16, 2006 that, prior to the Company&#146;s
announcement of the Audit Committee investigation, the Company and/or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive
Officer, at that time, and Chief Financial Officer violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 by making false and misleading statements,
or concealing information about the Company&#146;s business, forecasts and financial performance. The
complaints sought certification as a class action, unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys&#146;
fees and costs, and other relief. By order dated August&nbsp;3, 2006, the district court consolidated
the lawsuits into one consolidated action and on October&nbsp;31, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended
complaint adding SPP, Enoch E. Hartman III and Grant J. Bryson as defendants. Enoch E. Hartman III
is a former employee of the Company and SPP and Grant J. Bryson is a former employee of SPP. The
amended complaint also generally alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements
concerning the Company&#146;s business which caused the Company&#146;s securities to trade at inflated prices
during the class period. Plaintiff sought an unspecified amount of damages in the form of (i)
restitution; (ii)&nbsp;compensatory damages, including interest; and (iii)&nbsp;reasonable costs and
expenses. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on January&nbsp;19, 2007, and the parties
completed the briefs on the motion in May&nbsp;2007. On March&nbsp;31, 2009, the Court ruled on the
defendants&#146; motion to dismiss, granting it in part and denying it in part. While the Court&#146;s
ruling dismissed significant portions of plaintiffs&#146; amended complaint and, as a result, narrowed
the scope of plaintiffs&#146; claims, none of the defendants were dismissed from the case and several of
plaintiffs&#146; claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and
SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 remained. The parties were not in agreement as to the scope of the Court&#146;s order
and defendants filed a motion to confirm which claims the Court dismissed in its March&nbsp;31, 2009
ruling. The Court granted defendants&#146; motion to confirm the scope of the dismissal order on July
20, 2009, ruling that certain of Plaintiff&#146;s claims had been in fact dismissed. The Court also
confirmed, however, that certain other claims remained viable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;22, 2009, the Court administratively closed the shareholder litigation case, while the
parties pursued mediation of this matter. On February&nbsp;19, 2010, the parties agreed to the terms of
a mediator&#146;s proposal to settle all of the claims in this lawsuit. At a hearing on October&nbsp;15,
2010, the Court approved the settlement, entering a final judgment and dismissing with prejudice
all claims against all defendant in the litigation. The settlement provided for payment by the
Company of $10.5&nbsp;million and issuance by the Company of 300,000 shares of common stock. The total
value of the settlement, based upon the Company&#146;s closing share price for its common stock of
$15.12 per share on October&nbsp;15, 2010, is approximately $15.0&nbsp;million. During the second quarter of
2010, the $10.5&nbsp;million cash component of the settlement was paid by the Company to the escrow
agent appointed by the Court. On October&nbsp;18,

carrier has denied coverage of this matter. After failing to reach agreement with the excess D&#038;O
carrier concerning the amount of their contribution to the settlement, the Company filed suit
against the excess D&#038;O carrier in the second quarter of 2010. This suit is currently in the
discovery phase.

notifying it that the Office of the Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice is conducting
an inquiry into the indirect payment of claims by the Delaware Department of Correction to SPP
beginning in July&nbsp;2002 and ending in the spring of 2005 for pharmaceutical services. There can be
no assurance that the Delaware Department of Justice inquiry will not result in the Company
incurring additional investigation and related expenses; being required to make additional refunds;
incurring criminal, or civil penalties, including the imposition of fines; or being debarred from
pursuing future business in certain jurisdictions. Management of the Company is unable to predict
the effect that any such actions may have on its business, financial condition, results of
operations or stock price. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company received a written offer
from the Delaware Department of Justice to settle the inquiry in exchange for a cash payment. The
Company has reserves totaling $0.4&nbsp;million related to this matter which is the Company&#146;s estimate
of refund and associated interest due to the Delaware Department of Corrections, which was serviced
by a customer of SPP (see Item&nbsp;1. Business &#151; Audit Committee Investigation). This amount is
recorded in accrued expenses in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet. The Company is continuing
to cooperate with the Delaware Department of Justice during its inquiry.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company did not pay cash dividends on its common stock during the quarter ended March&nbsp;31,
2009 and quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2009. The Company paid a $0.05 per share dividend on the Company&#146;s
common stock for each of the quarters ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2009 and a $0.06
per share dividend on the Company&#146;s common stock for each of the quarters ended March&nbsp;31, 2010,
June&nbsp;30, 2010, September&nbsp;30, 2010 and December&nbsp;31, 2010. On March&nbsp;2, 2011, the Company&#146;s Board of
Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on the Company&#146;s common stock for
the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2011. The dividend will be paid on April&nbsp;12, 2011 to stockholders of
record on March&nbsp;22, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors&#146; adoption of a dividend program reflects the Company&#146;s intent to return
capital to stockholders. The Company expects that any future quarterly cash dividends will be paid
from cash generated by the Company&#146;s business in excess of its operating needs, interest and
principal payments on indebtedness, dividends on any future senior classes of the Company&#146;s capital
stock, if any, capital expenditures, taxes and future reserves, if any. Any future dividends will
be authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Company based upon a variety of factors
deemed relevant by directors of the Company. In addition, financial covenants in the Credit
Agreement may restrict the Company&#146;s ability to pay future quarterly dividends. The Board of
Directors will continue to evaluate the Company&#146;s dividend program each quarter and will make
adjustments as necessary, based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the
Company&#146;s financial condition, liquidity, earnings projections and business prospects, and no
assurance can be given that this dividend program will not change in
the future. The Company is prohibited under the terms of the Merger
Agreement from paying any additional dividends until the Merger
closes or the Merger Agreement is terminated.  See Part I - Item 1.

repurchase up to $15&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s common stock through the end of 2009. On July&nbsp;28,
2009, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the extension of this program by two years
through the end of 2011, while maintaining the total $15&nbsp;million limit. See Note 18 of the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.

and Note 6 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a
description of the reclassification from continuing operations to discontinued operations of
expired contracts. During 2006, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill of
$3.0&nbsp;million related to the Company&#146;s pharmaceutical distribution services segment. During 2010,
2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded increases of approximately $6.6&nbsp;million, $3.2
million, $6.3&nbsp;million, $10.5&nbsp;million and $4.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to healthcare expenses as a
result of adverse development related to professional liability claims. During 2010, 2009, 2008,
2007 and 2006, the Company incurred Audit Committee investigation and related expenses totaling
$0.5&nbsp;million, $8.4&nbsp;million, $0.2&nbsp;million, $0.1&nbsp;million and $5.3&nbsp;million, respectively, related to
an internal investigation into matters at SPP and costs related to shareholder litigation. The
Audit Committee investigation and related expenses incurred in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 are
primarily due to legal expenses incurred as part of the Company reaching a settlement on February
19, 2010, regarding the shareholder litigation filed against the Company and certain individual
defendants on April&nbsp;6, 2006 and related litigation filed by the Company against one of its
insurance carriers. For further information regarding the shareholder litigation, see Item&nbsp;3.
&#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148; See Item&nbsp;1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#148; for a discussion of material risks that could
affect the Company&#146;s results of operations in the future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working capital amounts as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 include $7.5&nbsp;million and $10.0
million, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the Company&#146;s revolving credit facilities in
place on those dates which were classified as current liabilities based on the maturity date of the
credit facility or in accordance with the U.S. GAAP as discussed below. Borrowings outstanding at
December&nbsp;31, 2007 were current due to the fact that the credit facility was scheduled to mature
within a year from the balance sheet date. Borrowings outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2006 were
scheduled to mature at a date in excess of a year from the respective balance sheet dates; however,
due to the presence of a typical material adverse effect clause in the loan agreement combined with
the existence of a mandatory lock-box agreement, borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit
facilities have been classified as current liabilities in accordance with the U.S. GAAP. For
further discussion, see &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations &#151; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; or Note 14 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts to provide healthcare services to correctional institutions are
principally fixed price contracts with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing
arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions and aggregate limits for off-site medical provider or
pharmaceutical costs. Such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent
renewal options and generally may be terminated by either party without cause upon proper notice.
Revenues earned under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that
services are rendered. Cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue
and recognized as income when the service is performed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fixed fee contracts, revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in
the service contract irrespective of inmate population. Revenues for population-based contracts
are calculated either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for
variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate
multiplied by the average inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee
contracts, revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus
a contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Company&#146;s contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a
portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site medical provider utilization
risk is mitigated in the majority of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for
off-site medical provider expenses, stop-loss provisions, cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some
cases, the entire exclusion of certain or all off-site medical provider service costs. Pharmacy
expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically, under the
terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue under the contract increases to offset increases in
specified cost categories such as off-site medical provider expenses or pharmaceutical costs. For
contracts that include such provisions, the Company recognizes the additional revenues due from
clients based on its estimates of applicable contract to date costs incurred as compared to the
corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs. Because such provisions typically specify
how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and require all such additional revenue to be
ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the additional revenues are initially recorded as
unbilled receivables until the time period for billing has been met and actual costs are known.
Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates of incurred costs and the actual costs are recorded
in the period in which such differences become known along with the corresponding adjustment to the
amount of recorded additional revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related
criteria. If necessary, the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods
when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table below illustrates these revenue categories as a percentage of total revenues from
continuing operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts under the population based and fixed fee categories generally have similar margins
which are higher than margins for contracts under the cost plus a fee category. Cost plus a fee
contracts generally have lower margins but with much less potential for variability due to the
limited risk involved. The Company&#146;s profitability under each of the three general contract
categories discussed above varies based on the level of risk assumed under the contract terms with
the most potential for variability being in contracts under the population based or fixed fee
categories which do not contain the risk mitigating provisions related to off-site medical provider
utilization described above. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, contracts accounting for
approximately 8.7% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing
operations do not contain such risk mitigating provisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and other healthcare
professionals and related benefits and all other direct costs of providing and/or administering
the managed care, including the costs associated with services provided and/or administered by
off-site medical providers, the costs of professional and general liability insurance and other
self-funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below. Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require
the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for all treatment costs or, in some cases, only
treatment costs related to certain catastrophic events, and/or for specific disease diagnoses
illnesses. Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts do not contain such limits. The Company attempts to
compensate for the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">increased financial risk when pricing contracts that do not contain individual, catastrophic
or specific disease diagnosis-related limits. However, the occurrence of severe individual cases,
specific disease diagnoses illnesses or a catastrophic event in a facility governed by a contract
without such limitations could render the contract unprofitable and could have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s operations. For certain of its contracts that do not contain catastrophic
protection, the Company maintains stop loss insurance from an unaffiliated insurer with respect
to, among other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital expenses (as defined in the policy) for
amounts in excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate and $3.0
million in total. Amounts reimbursable per claim under the policy are further limited to the
lessor of billed charges, the amount paid or the contracted amounts in situations where the
Company has negotiated rates with the applicable providers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of healthcare services provided, administered or contracted for are recognized in the
period in which they are provided and/or administered based in part on estimates, including an
accrual for estimated unbilled off-site medical provider services rendered through the balance
sheet date. The Company estimates the accrual for unbilled off-site medical provider services
using actual utilization data including hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and
emergency room and ambulance visits and their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the
average historical cost of such services. Additionally, the Company&#146;s utilization management
personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient hospital stays in order to identify any stays which
would have a cost in excess of the historical average rates. Once identified, reserves for such
stays are determined which take into consideration the specific facts of the stay. An actuarial
analysis is also prepared at least quarterly as an additional tool to be considered by management
in evaluating the adequacy of the Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have
sufficient claims payment history. The analysis takes into account historical claims experience
(including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial
data.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant fluctuations occur in the healthcare
cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of claims resulting
from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are
recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made. In 2010, the
Company recorded an increase of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million to its prior year claims liabilities as
a result of revisions to its estimated claims expense. In 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded
decreases of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million and $0.7&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims
liabilities as a result of revisions to its estimated claims expense. The impact to net income of
these reductions to the Company&#146;s claims reserves and associated expense is dependent upon whether
any of the associated customer contracts contained provisions limiting risk of off-site medical
provider costs. These reductions to claims reserves did not result in a significant impact to the
Company&#146;s net income as the changes occurred primarily in connection with contracts which contained
provisions limiting risk of off-site medical provider costs and, as a result, these changes were
off-set by corresponding additions or reductions to revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. The Company recognizes
allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors, including the length of time
receivables are past due, significant one-time events, contractual rights, client funding and/or
political pressures, discussions with clients and historical experience. If circumstances change,
estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted and such adjustments could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which they
are recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbilled accounts receivable generally represent additional revenue earned under shared-risk
contracting models that remain unbilled at each balance sheet date, due to provisions within the
contracts governing the timing for billing such amounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its clients will, from time to time, have disputes over amounts billed under
the Company&#146;s contracts. The Company records a reserve for contractual allowances in
circumstances where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed more fully in Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; PHS is currently involved in
a lawsuit with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;) involving the County&#146;s
lack of payment for services rendered. PHS has approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of receivables due from
the County, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006,
the date the Company&#146;s relationship with the County was terminated. The County has refused to pay
PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS filed suit against the County in the
Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of the outstanding receivables
balance, damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment as well as
prejudgment interest. During February&nbsp;2011, the parties agreed to resolve this matter through
binding arbitration which is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2011. At December&nbsp;31,
2010, the Company has classified these receivables as current assets in its consolidated balance
sheet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed more fully in Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; PHS believes, in the case of

that the outstanding receivables, which represent services performed under the contractual
relationship between the parties, continues to be probable of collection. Although PHS believes it
has valid contractual

results of this matter and/or PHS&#146; ability to collect the outstanding receivables amount.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, the Company believes the recorded amount represents valid receivables which
are contractually due from the County and expects full collection. However, due to the factors
discussed above and more fully in Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; there is a heightened risk
of uncollectibility of these receivables which may result in future losses. Nevertheless, the
Company intends to take all necessary and available measures in order to collect these receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in circumstances related to the matter discussed above involving the County, or any
other receivables, could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate
of contractual adjustments in future periods. Such change, if it were to occur, could have a
material adverse affect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position in the period
in which the change occurs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Loss Contracts</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying potential loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for
succeeding periods if any loss contracts are identified. The Company accrues losses under its
fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. The Company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific
contract basis taking into consideration such factors as the Company&#146;s ability to terminate the
contract, future contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs, projected
future stop-loss insurance recoveries and the contract&#146;s specific terms related to future revenue
increases as compared to increased healthcare costs. The projected future healthcare and
maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost
increases. These estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims
experience as previously noted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might identify
contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances. Circumstances that
might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period
include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions, unanticipated
adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the utilization of outside
medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues.
Should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future period, the Company would record,
in the period in which such identification is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that
would be incurred under the contract. The identification of a loss contract in the future could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which the
reserve is recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no loss contracts identified as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-Insurance Retention</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company&#146;s business occasionally results in actions for
negligence and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the
attendant risk of substantial damage awards, or court ordered non-monetary relief such as, changes
in operating practices or procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in
the Company&#146;s operating expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard
is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services, deliberate
indifference to their medical needs or the lack of timely or adequate healthcare services. The
Company may also be liable, as employer, for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs
or healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The Company&#146;s contracts generally provide for
the Company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided
by the Company and its agents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains a primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. For 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2010
with respect to the majority of its patients, the Company purchased commercial insurance coverage,
but is effectively self-insured due to the terms of the coverage which include adjustable premiums.
For 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2010, the Company is covered by separate policies, each of
which contains a premium that is retroactively adjusted, with adjustment based on actual losses.
The Company&#146;s ultimate premium for its 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2010 policies will depend
on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods. For 2007, the
Company is insured through claims made policies subject to per event and aggregate coverage limits.
In addition to the coverage described above, effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Company has purchased
an excess liability policy which provides coverage on a claims made basis for indemnity losses in
excess of $4.0&nbsp;million up to a maximum coverage of $10&nbsp;million per loss and in the aggregate. Any
amounts ultimately incurred above these coverage limits would be the responsibility of the Company.
Management establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will be incurred under these
insurance policies after taking into consideration the Company&#146;s professional liability claims
department and external counsel evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence, in addition to
its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported
claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by various analyses, including an actuarial
analysis, which is performed on a quarterly basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company&#146;s reserves for both known and incurred but not reported
claims totaled $22.6&nbsp;million. Reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number
of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next.
Reserves for medical malpractice claims can also fluctuate as a result of court decisions or as new
facts become available. Furthermore, payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities
frequently differ from the estimated liability. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from such
fluctuations and differences between management&#146;s established reserves and actual loss payments are
recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which
the estimates are changed or payments are made. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded
increases of approximately $6.6&nbsp;million, $3.2&nbsp;million and $6.3&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior
year claims reserves as a result of adverse development on individual claims or matters. The
reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the third-party insurance
carriers used by the Company. If a third party insurance carrier fails to meet its contractual
obligations under the agreement with the Company, the Company would then be responsible for such
obligations. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position
and its results of operations in the period in which the changes occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Self-Funded Insurance Reserves</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company has approximately $8.0&nbsp;million in accrued liabilities for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. Approximately $6.5&nbsp;million of this amount is
related to workers&#146; compensation claims, of which approximately $4.0&nbsp;million is included within the
noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is not expected to be paid within a year. The Company
is essentially self-insured for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain
individual case stop loss levels. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims
experience and the ability to control claims. The Company accrues the estimated liability for
employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between
the incident date and the date of actual claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated
liability for workers&#146; compensation claims based on evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims and analysis of claims history. These estimated liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted
basis. An actuarial analysis is prepared at least annually as an additional tool to be considered
by management in evaluating the adequacy of the Company&#146;s reserve for workers&#146; compensation claims.
These estimates of self-funded insurance reserves could change in the future based on changes in
the factors discussed above. Any adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are
reflected in current earnings. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded decreases of
approximately $1.6&nbsp;million, approximately $0.2&nbsp;million and approximately $0.9&nbsp;million,
respectively, related to its prior year other self-insurance reserves as a result of revisions to
its estimated claims experience.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to professional and general liability claims, the Company is also subject to other
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such proceedings generally relate to labor,
employment or contract matters. When estimable, the Company accrues an estimate of the probable
costs for the resolution of these claims. Such estimates are developed in consultation with outside
counsel handling the Company&#146;s defense in these matters and are based upon an estimated range of
potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible
that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially
affected by changes in assumptions, new developments or changes in approach, such as a change in
settlement strategy in dealing with such litigation. See discussion of certain outstanding legal
matters in Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to professional and general liability claims and other legal proceedings in the
ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in other legal matters related to an Audit
Committee investigation, which was announced by the Company on October&nbsp;24, 2005. See Part&nbsp;1 &#151;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more
frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill be tested at the reporting unit level, defined as an
operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component), with the
fair value of the reporting unit being compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not

goodwill impairment test as of the last day of each fiscal year, i.e. December&nbsp;31.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company uses a two-step process. The
first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the
impairment, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company determined the fair value
of its reporting unit to equal the market capitalization of its common stock as of the testing
date. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the indicated fair value of the Company&#146;s reporting unit exceeded
the carrying value of its reporting unit by a substantial amount, and, as such, the Company
concluded that there was no indication of goodwill impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that
the Company&#146;s goodwill is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse
impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review,

impairment test. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current
transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including
quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of
cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value of the asset could be different

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company determines that the carrying value of contract intangibles may not be

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company amortizes its contract intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life. The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles
on at least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and circumstances, including its
retention rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and circumstances indicate the current
estimated useful life is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the estimated useful life on a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of U.S. GAAP related to income
taxes. Under the asset and liability method of U.S. GAAP related to income taxes, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. U.S. GAAP requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance
of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million represents management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for tax contingency accruals under the provisions of U.S. GAAP
related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company&#146;s tax contingency accruals are
reviewed quarterly and can be adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. Adjustments to the tax contingency
accruals are recorded in the period in which the new facts or circumstances become known, therefore
the accruals are subject to change in future periods and such change, if it were to occur, could

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 6 to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, the Company is
applying the discontinued operations provisions of U.S. GAAP to all correctional healthcare service
contracts upon expiration of the contracts. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the results of
operations of contracts that expire, less applicable income taxes, are classified on the Company&#146;s
consolidated statements of operations separately from continuing operations. The presentation
prescribed for discontinued operations requires the collapsing of healthcare revenues and expenses,
as well as other specifically identifiable costs, into the income or loss from discontinued
operations, net of taxes. Items such as indirect selling, general and administrative expenses or
interest expense cannot be allocated to expired contracts. The U.S. GAAP accounting presentation
as it relates to discontinued operations and the Company&#146;s expired contracts has no impact on net
income, earnings per share, total cash flows or stockholders&#146; equity. As a result of the
application of U.S. GAAP related to discontinued operations, &#147;healthcare revenues&#148; and &#147;healthcare
expenses&#148; on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations for any period presented will only
include revenues and expenses from continuing contracts.

million, or 8.8%, from $579.5&nbsp;million in 2009 to $630.3&nbsp;million in 2010. Healthcare revenues in
2010 included $25.6&nbsp;million of revenue growth resulting from new correctional healthcare services
contracts added subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2009 through marketing activities. The primary
correctional healthcare services contract added during this time period was the Company&#146;s new
contract to provide healthcare services to the State of Michigan Department of Corrections, which
commenced on April&nbsp;1, 2009. Correctional healthcare services contracts in place at January&nbsp;1, 2009
and continuing beyond December&nbsp;31, 2010, experienced revenue growth of 5.1% consisting of an
increase in revenue of $25.2&nbsp;million during 2010 as the result of contract renegotiations and

increase. The primary correctional healthcare services contract added during this time period was
the Company&#146;s contract to provide healthcare services to the State of Michigan Department of
Corrections, which commenced on April&nbsp;1, 2009. Correctional healthcare services
contracts in place at January&nbsp;1, 2009 and continuing beyond December&nbsp;31, 2010, accounted for $27.4
million of the increase as a result of increases in the levels of staff and staff compensation,
increases in the off-site medical services and pharmacy costs associated with providing healthcare
to inmates at existing contracts. Included in this increase for continuing contracts is insurance
expense of approximately $6.6&nbsp;million and $3.2&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and

expenses were $0.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 as compared to $8.4&nbsp;million for the

Company reaching a settlement on February&nbsp;19, 2010, regarding the shareholder litigation filed
against the Company and certain individual defendants on April&nbsp;6, 2006 and related litigation filed
by the Company against one of its insurance carriers. The Audit Committee investigation and

recording a reserve related to the settlement discussed above, which was reached on February&nbsp;19,
2010; an insurance settlement for $8.0&nbsp;million entered into by the Company and its primary D&#038;O
insurance carrier; and legal expenses. See Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; for further

2010, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on its Credit Agreement resulting in a reduction in
interest expense. This reduction, combined with earnings on cash balances, resulted in net
interest income for the period.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company had working capital of $15.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to negative
working capital of $2.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, days sales outstanding
in accounts receivable were 30, accounts payable days outstanding were 30 and medical claims
liability days outstanding were 48. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, days sales outstanding in accounts
receivable were 25, accounts payable days outstanding were 19 and medical claims liability days
outstanding were 46.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company had net income of $9.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to
$3.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Company had stockholders&#146; equity of $55.8
million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 as compared to $42.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Company&#146;s cash
and cash equivalents increased to $39.6&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 from $37.7&nbsp;million at December
31, 2009. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash flows from operating
activities less capital expenditures, stock repurchases and dividend payments. The Company had no
outstanding balance on its credit facility at December&nbsp;31, 2010 or 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows from operating activities represent net income plus depreciation and amortization,
changes in various components of working capital and adjustments for various non-cash charges, such
as share-based compensation expense and deferred income taxes. Cash flows provided by operating
activities were $9.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 as compared with $24.5&nbsp;million
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The decrease was the result of a combined reduction of $8.2
million in accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued medical claims liability and deferred
revenue in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 as compared with a combined net increase of $32.6
million in these operating liabilities in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. This was partially
offset by a combined reduction of $2.1&nbsp;million in accounts receivable, deferred taxes, prepaid
expenses and other current assets and other assets in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 as compared
with a combined net increase of $16.1&nbsp;million in these operating assets in the year ended December
31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in investing activities were $4.9&nbsp;million and $4.5&nbsp;million, respectively, for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 which represented purchases of property and equipment
and management information systems under development, which were financed through cash flows from
operating activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 were $2.4
million which represented dividends on common stock of $2.2&nbsp;million, share repurchases of $0.5
million and restricted stock repurchased from employees for employees&#146;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Share Repurchases</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;27, 2008, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to
repurchase up to $15&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s common stock through the end of 2009. On July&nbsp;28,
2009, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the extension of this program by two years
through the end of 2011, while maintaining the total $15&nbsp;million limit. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010,
the Company has repurchased and retired a total of 891,850 shares of common stock under the stock
repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately
$11.2&nbsp;million. The Company is prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement from making any additional
repurchases of its common stock until the Merger closes or the Merger Agreement is terminated. See
Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;1. &#147;Business &#151; Significant Recent Development&#148;.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock repurchase program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to
time in either the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with SEC
requirements. The Company may elect to terminate or modify the program at any time. Under the
stock repurchase program, no shares will be purchased directly from officers or directors of the
Company. The timing, prices and sizes of purchases will depend upon prevailing stock prices,
general economic and market conditions and other considerations. Funds for the repurchase of
shares are expected to come primarily from cash provided by operating activities and also from
funds on hand, including amounts available under the Company&#146;s credit facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 18 of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dividends</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company paid a $0.05 cash dividend per share on the Company&#146;s common stock for each of the
quarters ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Company paid a $0.06 cash dividend
per share on the Company&#146;s common stock for each of the quarters ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, June&nbsp;30,
2010, September&nbsp;30, 2010 and December&nbsp;31, 2010. On March&nbsp;2, 2011, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors
declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on the Company&#146;s common stock for the quarter
ended March&nbsp;31, 2011. The dividend will be paid on April&nbsp;12, 2011 to stockholders of record on
March&nbsp;22, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors&#146; adoption of a dividend program reflects the Company&#146;s intent to return
capital to stockholders. The Company expects that any future quarterly cash dividends will be paid
from cash generated by the Company&#146;s business in excess of its operating needs, interest and
principal payments on indebtedness, dividends on any future senior classes of the Company&#146;s capital
stock, if any, capital expenditures, taxes and future reserves, if any. Any future dividends will
be authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Company based upon a variety of factors
deemed relevant by directors of the Company. In addition, financial covenants in the Credit
Agreement may restrict the Company&#146;s ability to pay future quarterly dividends. The Board of
Directors will continue to evaluate the Company&#146;s dividend program each quarter and will make
adjustments as necessary, based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the
Company&#146;s financial condition, liquidity, earnings projections and business prospects, and no
assurance can be given that this dividend program will not change in
the future. The Company is prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement from paying any additional
dividends until the Merger closes or the Merger Agreement is terminated. See Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;1.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Credit Facility</I>
</DIV>




<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;28, 2009, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement which was
subsequently amended on March&nbsp;2, 2010 (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) with CapitalSource Bank
(&#147;CapitalSource&#148;). The Credit Agreement is set to mature on October&nbsp;31, 2011 and includes a $40.0
million revolving credit facility, with a current facility cap of $20.0&nbsp;million, under which the
Company has available standby letters of credit up to $15.0&nbsp;million. The Company may request an
increase in the current facility cap of up to an additional $20.0&nbsp;million subject to lender
approval. The amount available to the Company for borrowings under the Credit Agreement is based
on the Company&#146;s collateral base, as determined under the Credit Agreement, and is reduced by the
amount of each outstanding standby letter of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by
substantially all assets of the Company and its operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. At December&nbsp;31, 2010,
the Company had $20.0&nbsp;million available for borrowing, based on the current facility cap and the
Company&#146;s collateral base on that date and no standby letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of eligible
receivables or (2) $20.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;Borrowing Capacity&#148;). Interest under the Credit Agreement
is payable monthly at an annual rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2%, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of
3.14%. The Company is also required to pay a monthly collateral management fee equal to 0.042% on
average borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a monthly unused line
fee equal to 0.0375% on the Borrowing Capacity less the actual average borrowings outstanding under
the Credit Agreement for the month and the balance of any outstanding letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will be due and payable on October&nbsp;31,
2011. If the Credit Agreement is extinguished prior to July&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company will be required
to pay an early termination fee equal to $0.4&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum level of EBITDA of $8.0
million on a trailing twelve-month basis to be measured at the end of each calendar quarter. The
Credit Agreement defines EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation
expense, amortization expense, any other non-cash non-recurring expense, loss from asset sales
outside of the normal course of business and charges and cash expenses arising out of the Audit
Committee investigation into matters at SPP including any expenses or charges incurred in the
associated shareholder securities suit provided such amounts, net of insurance recoveries, do not
exceed $4.5&nbsp;million in the aggregate, minus gains on asset sales outside the normal course of
business or other non-recurring gains. The Company was in compliance with the minimum level of
EBITDA covenant requirement at December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement permits the Company to declare and pay cash dividends, but requires the
Company to maintain both a pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio and a post-distribution
fixed charge coverage ratio both calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis to be measured at the
end of each calendar quarter. The Credit Agreement defines the pre-distribution fixed charge
coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding
debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital expenditures and cash income taxes paid or
accrued. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a minimum pre-distribution fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.75. The Credit Agreement defines the post-distribution fixed charge
coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding
debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, cash income taxes paid or
accrued, and cash dividends paid or accrued or declared. The Credit Agreement requires a minimum
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 if the Company&#146;s average net cash (cash less
outstanding debt) plus the average amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is
greater than or equal to $20.0&nbsp;million for the most recent calendar quarter; or, a minimum
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 if the Company&#146;s average net cash (cash less
outstanding debt) plus the average amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is
less than $20.0&nbsp;million for the most recent calendar quarter. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company
was in compliance with both the pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio and the
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently believes that cash flows from operating activities, its available cash,
and its expected available credit under the Amended Credit Agreement will continue to enable it to
meet its contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
The Company may, from time to time, consider acquisitions involving other companies or assets.
Such acquisitions or other opportunities may require the Company to raise additional capital by
expanding its existing credit facility and /or issuing debt or equity, as market conditions permit.
If the Company is unable to obtain such additional capital on a timely basis, on favorable terms
or at all, it could have inadequate capital to operate its business, meet its contractual
obligations and capital expenditure requirements or fund potential acquisitions. Current market
and economic conditions, including turmoil and uncertainty in the financial services industry and
credit markets, have caused credit markets to tighten and led many lenders and institutional
investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide, funding to borrowers. Should the credit
markets not improve, the Company can make no assurances that it would be able to secure additional
financing if needed and, if such funds were available, whether the terms or conditions would be
acceptable.

changes in the regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts
that extend beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of its
cost of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. If the rate of
inflation exceeds the levels projected, the excess costs will be absorbed by the Company with the
financial impact dependent upon contract structure. Conversely, the Company may benefit should the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial statements
of the Company due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. The Company&#146;s
exposure to market risk is primarily related to changes in the variable interest rate under the
Company&#146;s Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains an interest rate based on the one-month
LIBOR rate, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 3.14%; therefore the Company&#146;s cash flow may be
affected by changes in the one-month LIBOR rate. A hypothetical 10% change in the underlying
interest rate would have would have had no material effect on interest expense paid under the
Credit Agreement. Net interest expense (income)&nbsp;represents less than 1% of the Company&#146;s revenues
for each the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009. The Company has no debt outstanding at
December&nbsp;31, 2010.

the Company&#146;s Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the &#147;Audit Committee&#148;) conducted a
competitive process to select a firm to serve as the Company&#146;s independent registered public
accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2009. As a result of this process and
following careful deliberation, on June&nbsp;10, 2009, the Audit Committee engaged Deloitte &#038; Touche LLP
(&#147;Deloitte&#148;) as the Company&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year
ending December&nbsp;31, 2009, and dismissed Ernst &#038; Young LLP (&#147;E&#038;Y&#148;) from that role on June&nbsp;10, 2009.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure controls and procedures are the Company&#146;s controls and other procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported in a complete, accurate and appropriate manner, within the time
periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company evaluated under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures,
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;13a-15 and Rule&nbsp;15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules&nbsp;13a &#151; 15(f).
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;). Based on management&#146;s
assessment under such framework, management concluded that the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deloitte &#038; Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, has issued an

page 36.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been no changes in the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting during
the Company&#146;s fourth fiscal quarter that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of<BR>
America Service Group Inc.<BR>
Brentwood, Tennessee

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of America Service Group Inc. and
subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, based on criteria established in <I>Internal
Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company&#146;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company&#146;s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, based on the criteria established in <I>Internal Control
&#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.
</DIV>

Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of
and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated March&nbsp;2, 2011

subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the
period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item&nbsp;15 (a). These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

the financial position of America Service Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the
period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Use of Estimates</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;U. S. GAAP&#148;) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the more
significant areas requiring estimates in the consolidated financial statements include the
Company&#146;s accruals for unbilled medical services calculated based upon a claims payment lag
methodology, realization of goodwill, estimated amortizable life of contract intangibles,
reductions in revenue for contractual allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, legal
contingencies and share-based compensation as well as accruals associated with employee health,
workers&#146; compensation and professional and general liability claims, for which the Company is
substantially self-insured. Estimates change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, or
additional information is obtained. A change in an estimate is accounted for in the period of
change.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets consist of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Due to
the short term nature of these instruments and the variable interest rate nature of the cash
equivalents, the carrying amounts approximate fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts to provide healthcare services to correctional institutions are
principally fixed price contracts with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing
arrangements, such as stop-loss provisions and aggregate limits for off-site medical provider or
pharmaceutical costs. Such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent
renewal options and generally may be terminated by either party without cause upon proper notice.
Revenues earned under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that
services are rendered. Cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue
and recognized as income when the service is performed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fixed fee contracts, revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in
the service contract irrespective of inmate population. Revenues for population-based contracts
are calculated either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for
variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate
multiplied by the average inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee
contracts, revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus
a contractual fee.

<!-- xbrl -->

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Company&#146;s contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a
portion of the Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site medical provider utilization
risk is mitigated in the majority of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for
off-site medical provider expenses, stop-loss provisions, cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some
cases, the entire exclusion of certain or all off-site medical provider service costs. Pharmacy
expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts. Typically, under the
terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue under the contract increases to offset increases in
specified cost categories such as off-site medical provider expenses or pharmaceutical costs. For
contracts that include such provisions, the Company recognizes the additional revenues due from
clients based on its estimates of applicable contract to date costs incurred as compared to the
corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs. Because such provisions typically specify
how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and require all such additional revenue to be
ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the additional revenues are initially recorded as
unbilled receivables until the time period for billing has been met and actual costs are known.
Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates of incurred costs and the actual costs are recorded
in the period in which such differences become known along with the corresponding adjustment to the
amount of recorded additional revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related
criteria. If necessary, the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods
when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table below illustrates these revenue categories as a percentage of total revenues from
continuing operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts under the population based and fixed fee categories generally have similar margins
which are higher than margins for contracts under the cost plus a fee category. Cost plus a fee
contracts generally have lower margins but with much less potential for variability due to the
limited risk involved. The Company&#146;s profitability under each of the three general contract
categories discussed above varies based on the level of risk assumed under the contract terms with
the most potential for variability being in contracts under the population based or fixed fee
categories which do not contain the risk mitigating provisions related to off-site medical provider
utilization described above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and other healthcare
professionals and related benefits and all other direct costs of providing and/or administering
the managed care, including the costs associated with services provided and/or administered by
off-site medical providers, the costs of professional and general liability insurance and other
self-funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below. Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require
the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for all treatment costs or, in some cases, only
treatment costs related to certain catastrophic events, and/or for specific disease diagnoses
illnesses. Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts do not contain such limits. The Company attempts to
compensate for the increased financial risk when pricing contracts that do not contain individual,
catastrophic or specific disease diagnosis-related limits. However, the occurrence of severe
individual cases, specific disease diagnoses illnesses or a catastrophic event in a facility
governed by a contract without such limitations could render the contract unprofitable and could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations. For certain of its contracts that do
not contain catastrophic protection, the Company maintains stop loss insurance from an
unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital
expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual
cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate and $3.0&nbsp;million in total. Amounts reimbursable per claim under
the policy are further limited to the lessor of billed charges, the amount paid or the contracted
amounts in situations where the Company has negotiated rates with the applicable providers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of healthcare services provided, administered or contracted for are recognized in the
period in which they are provided and/or administered based in part on estimates, including an
accrual for estimated unbilled off-site medical provider services rendered through the balance
sheet date. The Company estimates the accrual for unbilled off-site medical provider services
using actual utilization data including hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and
emergency room and ambulance visits and their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the
average historical cost of such services. Additionally, the Company&#146;s utilization management
personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient hospital stays in order to identify any stays which
would have a cost in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">excess of the historical average rates. Once identified, reserves for such stays are
determined which take into consideration the specific facts of the stay. An actuarial analysis is
also prepared at least quarterly as an additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating
the adequacy of the Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims
payment history. The analysis takes into account historical claims experience (including the
average historical costs and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial data.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant fluctuations occur in the healthcare
cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of claims resulting
from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are
recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made. In 2010, the
Company recorded an increase of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million to its prior year claims liabilities as
a result of revisions to its estimated claims expense. In 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded
decreases of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million and $0.7&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims
liabilities as a result of revisions to its estimated claims expense. The impact to net income of
these reductions to the Company&#146;s claims reserves and associated expense is dependent upon whether
any of the associated customer contracts contained provisions limiting risk of off-site medical
provider costs. The reductions to claims reserves did not result in a significant impact to the
Company&#146;s net income as the changes occurred primarily in connection with contracts which contained
provisions limiting risk of off-site medical provider costs and, as a result, these changes were
off-set by corresponding additions or reductions to revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, money market funds and
investments which can be liquidated within three months or less when purchased. Due to the short
term nature of these instruments, the carrying amounts approximate fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company regularly maintains cash balances at a commercial bank in excess of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. If the commercial bank were to fail or
be seized by federal regulators, the Company could lose a portion of its cash deposits at such
bank, the result of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position
and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable represent amounts due from state and local governments for healthcare
services provided and/or administered by the Company. Included in unbilled accounts receivable is
the Company&#146;s estimate of revenue earned under risk sharing provisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. The Company recognizes
allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors, including the length of time
receivables are past due, significant one-time events, contractual rights, client funding and/or
political pressures, discussions with clients and historical experience. If circumstances change,
estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted and such adjustments could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which they

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Goodwill</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more
frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill be tested at the reporting unit level, defined as an
operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component), with the
fair value of the reporting unit being compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not
considered to be impaired. The Company has determined that it has one operating, as well as one
reportable, segment. The Company&#146;s policy is to perform its annual goodwill impairment test as of
the last day of each fiscal year, i.e. December&nbsp;31.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company uses a two-step process. The
first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the
impairment, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company determined the fair value
of its reporting unit to equal the market capitalization of its common stock as of the testing
date. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the indicated fair value of the Company&#146;s reporting unit exceeded
the carrying value of its reporting unit by a substantial amount, and, as such, the Company
concluded that there was no indication of goodwill impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that
the Company&#146;s goodwill is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse
impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review,
other than the annual impairment test, include the following:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired based upon the
existence of one or more of the above or other indicators of impairment or as a result of its
annual impairment review, any impairment is measured using a fair-value-based goodwill impairment
test. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current
transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including
quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates
of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value of the asset could be
different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Contract Intangibles</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s other identifiable intangible assets represent customer contracts which were
acquired in acquisitions and are amortized on the straight-line method over the contract&#146;s
estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract
intangibles on at least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and circumstances,
including its retention rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and circumstances indicate the
current estimated useful life is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the estimated useful
life on a prospective basis. Contract amortization expense totaled approximately $0.3&nbsp;million,
$0.3&nbsp;million and $1.7&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also assesses the potential impairment of its contract intangibles whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When the
Company determines that the carrying value of contract intangibles may not be recoverable based
upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, such impairment will be
measured using an estimate of the asset&#146;s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected
to result from that asset, including eventual disposition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 include cash deposits totaling approximately $11.5
million and $9.8&nbsp;million, respectively, which are held by the Company&#146;s professional liability
insurer and workers compensation insurer and are not expected to be utilized within the next year.
In addition to cash deposits recorded within other assets, the Company has recorded cash
deposits for professional liability claims losses totaling $5.5&nbsp;million and $8.5&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, within prepaid expenses and other current assets, which
are expected to be utilized within a year. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s professional
liability insurance policies for 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2010, this cash will be used
by the insurer to pay any professional liability claims made against the Company during those
years. Based on evaluation of outstanding claims, management estimates the amount of cash
deposits that will be utilized by the insurer to pay losses within a year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 are deferred financing costs
associated with the Company&#146;s credit facility (see Note 14). Such costs are being amortized over
the life of the credit facility and such amortization is included in interest expense on the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense associated with deferred
financing costs was approximately $31,000, $0.1&nbsp;million and $40,000 for the years ended December
31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Long-Lived Assets</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company considers whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets held for use
(including the Company&#146;s property and equipment, contracts and other intangibles) are present. If
such indicators are present, the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows attributable to such assets is less than their carrying amount, and if so,
recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their
fair value. Accordingly, management periodically evaluates the ongoing value of property and
equipment and intangible assets and considers events, circumstances and operating results,
including consideration of contract performance at the fixed price contract level, to determine if
impairment exists. If long-lived assets are deemed impaired, management adjusts the asset value
to fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of U.S. GAAP related to income
taxes. Under the asset and liability method of U.S. GAAP related to income taxes, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. U.S. GAAP requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance
of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million represents management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss
carryforwards which will expire unused.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for tax contingency accruals under the provisions of U.S. GAAP related to
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as adopted on January&nbsp;1, 2007. The Company&#146;s tax
contingency accruals are reviewed quarterly and can be adjusted in light of changing facts and
circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. Adjustments
to the tax contingency accruals are recorded in the period in which the new facts or circumstances
become known, therefore the accruals are subject to change in future periods and such change, if it
were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Company&#146;s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to its tax
contingencies as income tax expense. As the Company has no tax contingencies at December&nbsp;31, 2010,
there is no accrued interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state
jurisdictions. The Company may be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;)
for calendar years 2007 through 2010. The Company is currently under audit for the 2008 tax year.
Additionally, open tax years related to certain state and local jurisdictions remain subject to
examination.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-Insurance Retention</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company&#146;s business occasionally results in actions for
negligence and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the
attendant risk of substantial damage awards, or court ordered non-monetary relief such as, changes
in operating practices or procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in
the Company&#146;s operating expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard
is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services, deliberate
indifference to their medical needs or the lack of timely or adequate healthcare services. The
Company may also be liable, as employer, for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs
or healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The Company&#146;s contracts generally provide for
the Company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided
by the Company and its agents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains a primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. For 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2010
with respect to the majority of its patients, the Company purchased commercial insurance coverage,
but is effectively self-insured due to the terms of the coverage which include adjustable premiums.
For 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2010, the Company is covered by separate policies, each of
which contains a premium that is retroactively adjusted, with adjustment based on actual losses.
The Company&#146;s ultimate premium for its 2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2010 policies will depend
on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods. For 2007, the
Company is insured through claims made policies subject to per event and aggregate coverage limits.
In addition to the coverage described above, effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Company has purchased
an excess liability policy which provides coverage on a claims made basis for indemnity losses in
excess of $4.0&nbsp;million up to a maximum coverage of $10&nbsp;million per loss and in the aggregate. Any
amounts ultimately incurred above these coverage limits would be the responsibility of the Company.
Management establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will be incurred under these
insurance policies after taking into consideration the Company&#146;s professional liability claims
department and external counsel evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis of
claim history, actuarial analysis and coverage limits where applicable. Any adjustments resulting
from these ongoing reviews are reflected in current earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence, in addition to
its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported
claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by various analyses, including an actuarial
analysis, which is performed on a quarterly basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Self-funded Insurance Reserves</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company has approximately $8.0&nbsp;million in accrued liabilities for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. Approximately $6.5&nbsp;million of this amount is
related to workers&#146; compensation claims, of which approximately $4.0&nbsp;million is included within the
noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is not expected to be paid within a year. The Company
is essentially self-insured for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain
individual case stop loss levels. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims
experience and the ability to control claims. The Company accrues the estimated liability for
employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between
the incident date and the date of actual claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated
liability for workers&#146; compensation claims based on evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims and analysis of claims history. These estimated liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted
basis. An actuarial analysis is prepared at least annually as an additional tool to be considered
by management in evaluating the adequacy of the Company&#146;s reserve for workers&#146; compensation claims.
These estimates of self-funded insurance reserves could change in the future based on changes in
the factors discussed above. Any adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are
reflected in current earnings. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded decreases of
approximately $1.6&nbsp;million, $0.2&nbsp;million and $0.9&nbsp;million, respectively, related to its prior year
other self-insurance reserves as a result of revisions to its estimated claims experience. After
considering the impact of earnings that would have been allocated to participating securities in
calculating net income per common share (see Note 17), the Company&#146;s net income available to common
shareholders and basic and diluted net income per common share were positively impacted as a result
of revisions to its estimated experience by amounts totaling $1.0&nbsp;million and $0.11 per common
share, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, $0.1&nbsp;million and $0.01 per common share, for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $0.5&nbsp;million and $0.06 per common share, for the year ended December

awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of
variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility
over the term of the awards and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, the Company

holidays and tenant build-out incentives or allowances, the Company applies them in the
determination of straight-line rent expense over the lease term. The amount of the excess of
straight-line rent expense over scheduled payments is recorded as a deferred liability on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s credit risks relate primarily to cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable

represent amounts due primarily from governmental agencies. Accounts receivable due from the
Virginia Department of Corrections and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections
represent approximately 37% and 20% of accounts receivable, less allowances, at December&nbsp;31, 2010,
respectively. Deposits on professional liability and other insurance programs represent amounts
paid by the Company that are subject to future refund from the insurance company which provides the
coverage. Currently, these balances are carried by American International Group (&#147;AIG&#148;) for
workers compensation and various regulated subsidiaries of AIG for professional liability. The
Company&#146;s financial instruments are subject to the possibility of loss in carrying value as a
result of either the failure of other parties to perform according to their contractual obligations
or changes in market prices that make the instruments less valuable. Additionally, if the
financial position and/or liquidity of one of these third party insurance carriers were to become
impaired such that the third party insurer was unable to pay claims or meet its contractual
obligations to the Company, the Company could lose all or a portion of its prepaid premiums to such
carrier and/or lose the benefit of the coverage the Company has paid for, the occurrence of which

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>3. Audit Committee Investigation</B>
</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;24, 2005, the Company announced that the Audit Committee had initiated an internal
investigation into certain matters related to SPP. As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company
announced that the Audit Committee had concluded its investigation and reached certain conclusions
with respect to findings of the investigation that resulted in an accrual of $3.7&nbsp;million of
aggregate refunds due to customers, including PHS, that were not charged by SPP in accordance with
the terms of the respective contracts. In circumstances where SPP&#146;s incorrect billings resulted in
PHS billing its clients incorrectly, PHS passed the applicable amount through to its clients. This
amount plus associated interest represented management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to
affected customers, based on the results of the Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. As of December
31, 2010, the Company has paid all of these refunds plus associated interest to customers except
for $0.4&nbsp;million which has been tendered for payment to the Delaware Department of Corrections,
which was serviced by a customer of SPP (see Note 21). The ultimate amounts paid could differ from
the Company&#146;s estimates; however, actual amounts to date have not differed materially from the
estimated amounts. There can be no assurance that the Company, a customer or a third-party,
including a governmental entity, will not assert that additional amounts, which may include
penalties and/or associated interest, are owed to these customers. During the year ended December
31, 2010, the Company recognized additional expense totaling $0.5&nbsp;million relative to this matter

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;16, 2010, the former Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief
Compliance Officer of the Company, resigned his position, effective July&nbsp;16, 2010. In connection
with his resignation and this restructuring, his duties and responsibilities were reassigned to
various members of management. The Company incurred a one-time termination charge related to the
restructuring of approximately $0.3&nbsp;million, comprised of $0.2&nbsp;million in accrued compensation and
benefits and a $0.1&nbsp;million non-cash charge related to the accelerated vesting of remaining
unvested restricted shares. The accrued compensation and benefits, which will be fully paid by
July&nbsp;16, 2011, are included in accrued expenses in the Company&#146;s condensed consolidated balance
sheet. The non-cash charge related to the stock based compensation is included in additional paid
in capital in the Company&#146;s condensed consolidated balance sheet.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;15, 2008, the Company entered into a separation agreement and general
release with Michael Catalano, which was subsequently modified on November&nbsp;7, 2008 (the &#147;Separation
Agreement&#148;). Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Catalano resigned his position as
Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective December&nbsp;30, 2008. The Separation Agreement also
provided for Mr.&nbsp;Catalano&#146;s resignation from the Company and from its Board of Directors effective
January&nbsp;1, 2009, the termination of Mr.&nbsp;Catalano&#146;s previously existing employment agreement and the
release of claims by each of Mr.&nbsp;Catalano and the Company against each other. Additionally, in
connection with this resignation, the Company elected to its Board of Directors and amended the
employment agreements of Richard Hallworth, its current President and Chief Executive Officer, and
Michael W. Taylor, its current Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
The Company incurred a charge related to the Separation Agreement of approximately $2.3&nbsp;million,
comprised of $1.5&nbsp;million in compensation and benefits, a $0.7&nbsp;million non-cash charge related to
the accelerated vesting of remaining unvested stock options and restricted shares and the
modification of the time period in which to exercise stock options and $0.1&nbsp;million in legal and
consulting fees. The non-cash charge related to the stock based compensation is included in
additional paid in capital in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying potential loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for
succeeding periods if any loss contracts are identified. The Company accrues losses under its
fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. The Company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific
contract basis taking into consideration such factors as the Company&#146;s ability to terminate the
contracts, future contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs, projected
future stop-loss insurance recoveries and each contract&#146;s specific terms related to future revenue
increases as compared to increased healthcare costs. The projected future healthcare and
maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost
increases. These estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims
experience as previously noted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might identify
contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances. Circumstances that
might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period
include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions, unanticipated
adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the utilization of outside
medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues.
Should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future period, the Company would record,
in the period in which such identification is made, a reserve for the estimated future losses that
would be incurred under the contract. The identification of a loss contract in the future could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which the
reserve is recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no loss contracts identified as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to U.S. GAAP related to discontinued operations, each of the Company&#146;s correctional
healthcare services contracts is a component of an entity whose operations can be distinguished
from the rest of the Company. Therefore, when a correctional healthcare services contract
terminates, by expiration or otherwise, the contract&#146;s operations generally will be eliminated from
the ongoing operations of the Company and classified as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the
operations of such contracts, net of applicable income taxes, have been presented as discontinued
operations and prior period consolidated statements of operations have been reclassified.

distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbilled accounts receivable generally represent additional revenue earned under shared-risk
contracting models that remain unbilled at each balance sheet date, due to provisions within the
contracts governing the timing for billing such amounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its clients will, from time to time, have disputes over amounts billed under
the Company&#146;s contracts. The Company records a reserve for contractual allowances in
circumstances where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed more fully in Note 21, PHS is currently involved in a lawsuit with its former
client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;) involving the County&#146;s lack of payment for
services rendered. PHS has approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of receivables due from the County,
primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006, the date the
Company&#146;s relationship with the County was terminated. The County has refused to pay PHS for these
amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS filed suit against the County in the Circuit Court
for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of the outstanding receivables balance, damages
for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment as well as prejudgment interest.
During February&nbsp;2011, the parties agreed to resolve this matter through binding arbitration which
is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2011. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company has
classified these receivables as current assets in its consolidated balance sheet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed more fully in Note 21, PHS believes, in the case of this lawsuit, that it has a
valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the outstanding
receivables, which represent services performed under the contractual relationship between the
parties, are probable of collection. Although PHS believes it has valid contractual and legal
arguments, an adverse result in this lawsuit could have a negative impact on the results of this
matter and/or PHS&#146; ability to collect the outstanding receivables amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, the Company believes the recorded amount represents valid receivables which
are contractually due from the County and expects full collection. However, due to the factors
discussed above and more fully in Note 21, there is a heightened risk of uncollectibility of these
receivables which may result in future losses. Nevertheless, the Company intends to take all
necessary and available measures in order to collect these receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in circumstances related to the matter discussed above, or any other receivables,
could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate of contractual
adjustments in future periods. Such change, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse
affect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position in the period in which the
change occurs.

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;28, 2009, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement which was
subsequently amended on March&nbsp;2, 2010 (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) with CapitalSource Bank
(&#147;CapitalSource&#148;). The Credit Agreement is set to mature on October&nbsp;31, 2011 and includes a $40.0
million revolving credit facility, with a current facility cap of $20.0&nbsp;million, under which the
Company has available standby letters of credit up to $15.0&nbsp;million. The Company may request an
increase in the current facility cap of up to an additional $20.0&nbsp;million subject to lender
approval. The amount available to the Company for borrowings under the Credit Agreement is based
on the Company&#146;s collateral base, as determined under the Credit Agreement, and is reduced by the
amount of each outstanding standby letter of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by
substantially all assets of the Company and its operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. At December&nbsp;31, 2010,
the Company had $20.0&nbsp;million available for borrowing, based on the current facility cap and the
Company&#146;s collateral base on that date and no standby letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of eligible
receivables or (2) $20.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;Borrowing Capacity&#148;). Interest under the Credit Agreement
is payable monthly at an annual rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2%, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of
3.14%. The Company is also required to pay a monthly collateral management fee equal to 0.042% on
average borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a monthly unused line
fee equal to 0.0375% on the Borrowing Capacity less the actual average borrowings outstanding under
the Credit Agreement for the month and the balance of any outstanding letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will be due and payable on October&nbsp;31,
2011. If the Credit Agreement is extinguished prior to July&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company will be required
to pay an early termination fee equal to $0.4&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum level of EBITDA of $8.0
million on a trailing twelve-month basis to be measured at the end of each calendar quarter. The
Credit Agreement defines EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation
expense, amortization expense, any other non-cash non-recurring expense, loss from asset sales
outside of the normal course of business and charges and cash expenses arising out of the Audit
Committee investigation into matters at SPP including any expenses or charges incurred in the
associated shareholder securities suit provided such amounts, net of insurance recoveries, do not
exceed $4.5&nbsp;million in the aggregate, minus gains on asset sales outside the normal course of
business or other non-recurring gains. The Company was in compliance with the minimum level of
EBITDA covenant requirement at December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement permits the Company to declare and pay cash dividends, but requires the
Company to maintain both a pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio and a post-distribution
fixed charge coverage ratio both calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis to be measured at the
end of each calendar quarter. The Credit Agreement defines the pre-distribution fixed charge
coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding
debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital expenditures and cash income taxes paid or
accrued. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a minimum pre-distribution fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.75. The Credit Agreement defines the post-distribution fixed charge
coverage ratio as EBITDA, as defined above, divided by the sum of principal payments on outstanding
debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, cash income taxes paid or
accrued, and cash dividends paid or accrued or declared. The Credit Agreement requires a minimum
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 if the Company&#146;s average net cash (cash less
outstanding debt) plus the average amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is
greater than or equal to $20.0&nbsp;million for the most recent calendar quarter; or, a minimum
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 if the Company&#146;s average net cash (cash less
outstanding debt) plus the average amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is
less than $20.0&nbsp;million for the most recent calendar quarter. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company
was in compliance with both the pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio and the
post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio.

consideration such factors as historical financial results, projected future taxable income and the
expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. U.S. GAAP requires the
Company to record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; At each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010,
2009 and 2008, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, represents

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
$2.4&nbsp;million and $17.3&nbsp;million, respectively, which expire at various dates through 2032.
Included in current deferred tax assets at December&nbsp;31, 2010 are federal and state net operating

limitations as the Company&#146;s other net operating losses and upon realization will be recorded as

expected volatility on historical volatility of the Company&#146;s stock. The Company estimated the
expected term of stock options using historical exercise and employee termination experience.
There were no options granted during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The following table shows

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the approved Board of Directors compensation program, each new non-employee
Director (as defined by the 2009 Equity Plan) upon election to the Board of Directors, receives
10,000 restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock issued pursuant to the 2009 Equity Plan.
Additionally, each non-employee director receives 3,000 restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock on an annual basis. Effective December&nbsp;8, 2010, each non-employee director received 3,000
restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, which was an aggregate grant to all non-employee
directors of 15,000 shares. Each new Director and each non-employee director shall have the
right, among other rights, to receive cash dividends on all of these shares and to vote such
shares unless the director&#146;s right to such shares is forfeited. The shares granted to each new
Director upon election to the Board of Directors become nonforfeitable in equal annual
installments over four years beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The shares
granted annually to each non-employee director become nonforfeitable in equal annual installments
over three years beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The restricted shares
are valued at the market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant and are
recognized as compensation expense over the restricted stock&#146;s vesting period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;3, 2010, the Incentive Stock and Compensation Committee elected to approve a new
compensation package for non-management directors effective January&nbsp;1, 2011, which increased the
non-employee director annual restricted share grant to 4,000 restricted shares of the Company&#146;s
common stock and reduced the new Director restricted share grants to 5,000 restricted shares of
the Company&#146;s common stock upon election to the Board.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31, 2010, there were $0.8 million of total unrecognized compensation costs
related to nonvested restricted stock that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 1.34&nbsp;years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized share-based
compensation cost related to restricted stock of $1.7&nbsp;million, $1.3&nbsp;million and $0.9&nbsp;million,
respectively, which was classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company instituted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 1996 pursuant to which an
aggregate of 750,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock may be sold. The Employee Stock Purchase
Plan allows eligible employees to elect to purchase shares of common stock through voluntary
automatic payroll deductions of up to 10% of the employee&#146;s annual salary. Purchases of stock
under the plan are made at the end of two six-month offering periods each year, one beginning on
January 1 and one beginning on July 1. At the end of each six-month period, the employee&#146;s
contributions during that six-month period are used to purchase shares of common stock from the
Company at 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of that
six-month period, whichever is lower. The employee may elect to discontinue participation in the
plan at any time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, there were 253,893 shares available for future employee purchases under
the above plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records compensation expense for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the
fair value of the employees&#146; purchase rights, which is estimated using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The following table shows the weighted average assumptions used to develop the fair
value estimates for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009:

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net income (loss) per share is measured at two levels: basic income (loss)&nbsp;per common share
and diluted income (loss)&nbsp;per common share. Basic income (loss)&nbsp;per common share is computed by
dividing net income (loss)&nbsp;available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss)&nbsp;per common share is computed by
dividing net income (loss)&nbsp;available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding after considering the additional dilution related to other dilutive
non-participating securities. The Company&#146;s other dilutive non-participating securities
outstanding consist of options to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies that unvested share-based payment
awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or
unpaid, are participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per
share under the &#147;two class&#148; method. In periods where the Company has income from continuing
operations, the &#147;two class&#148; method allocates undistributed earnings between common shares and
participating securities. In periods in which the Company has incurred a loss from continuing
operations, the &#147;two-class&#148; method does not result in an allocation of such loss between the
Company&#146;s common shares and participating securities. Based on this clarification, the Company has
determined that its unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 27, 2008, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to
repurchase up to $15&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s common stock through the end of 2009. On July&nbsp;28,
2009, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the extension of this program by two years
through the end of 2011, while maintaining the total $15&nbsp;million limit. This program is intended
to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in either the open market or through
private transactions, in accordance with SEC requirements. The Company may elect to terminate or
modify the program at any time. Under the stock repurchase program, no shares will be purchased
directly from officers or directors of the Company. The timing, prices and sizes of purchases will
depend upon prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions and other
considerations. Funds for the repurchase of shares are expected to come primarily from cash
provided by operating activities and also from funds on hand, including amounts available under the
Company&#146;s credit facility. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company repurchased and
retired a total of 33,500 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $0.5&nbsp;million. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company has repurchased and retired a total of 891,850 shares of common
stock under the stock repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately $11.2&nbsp;million.
Under the terms of the transaction discussed in Note 24, the Company is prohibited from
making any additional repurchases of its common stock until the
transaction is either
closed or terminated.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) covering substantially all
employees who have completed 60&nbsp;days of service. The Plan permits eligible employees to defer and
contribute to the Plan a portion of their compensation. The Company may, at the Board&#146;s
discretion, match such employee contributions to the Plan ranging from 1% to 3% of eligible
compensation, depending on the employee&#146;s years of participation. The Company made no matching
contributions in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company contributes to two multiemployer pension plans on behalf of
employees covered by collective bargaining agreements under the
Rikers Island, New York contract.
Generally, the plans provide defined benefits to substantially all employees covered by the
collective bargaining agreements. The Company is reimbursed under its cost-plus Rikers Island
contract for the actual costs and average increases required under the collective bargaining
agreements. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the contributions to these plans, which were reimbursed to
the Company, due to the cost-plus nature of the Rikers Island
contract were $2.8&nbsp;million, $2.7
million and $2.5&nbsp;million, respectively. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended (&#147;ERISA&#148;), a contributor to a multiemployer plan may be liable, upon termination or
withdrawal from a plan, for a proportionate share of a plan&#146;s unfunded vested liability, if any.
No liability is presently required to be recorded as the future funded status of the plans, as
well as the probability of any withdrawal event, are unknown. The Company would also seek
reimbursement of any such liability from the client under the cost-plus Rikers Island contract.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2010, the Company&#146;s reserves for both known as well as incurred but not
reported professional and general liability claims totaled $22.6&nbsp;million. Reserves for
professional and general liability claims fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity
of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next. Furthermore, payments with respect
to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability. Changes in
estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between management&#146;s
established reserves and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for
professional and general liability claims in the period in which the estimates are changed or
payments are made. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded increases of approximately $6.6
million, $3.2&nbsp;million and $6.3&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims reserves as a result
of adverse development on individual claims or matters. After considering the impact of earnings
that would have been allocated to participating securities in calculating net income per common
share (see Note 17), the Company&#146;s net income available to common shareholders and basic and
diluted net income per common share were negatively impacted as a result of

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for
all treatment costs or, in some cases, only treatment costs related to certain catastrophic
events, and/or for specific disease diagnoses illnesses. Certain of the Company&#146;s contracts do not
contain such limits. The Company attempts to compensate for the increased financial risk when
pricing contracts that do not contain individual, catastrophic or specific disease
diagnosis-related limits. However, the occurrence of severe individual cases, specific disease
diagnoses illnesses or a catastrophic event in a facility governed by a contract without such
limitations could render the contract unprofitable and could have a material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s operations. For certain of its contracts that do not contain catastrophic protection,
the Company maintains stop loss insurance from an unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among
other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in
excess of $375,000 per inmate up to an annual cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate and $3.0&nbsp;million in
total. Amounts reimbursable per claim under the policy are further limited to the lessor of
billed charges, the amount paid or the contracted amounts in situations where the Company has
negotiated rates with the applicable providers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Litigation and Claims</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its business. With respect
to all litigation matters, the Company considers the likelihood of a negative outcome typically in
consultation with outside counsel handling the Company&#146;s defense in these matters and estimates of
the probable costs for resolution of these matters are based upon an estimated range of potential
results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. If the Company
determines the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated, the Company records an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the
litigation. However, it is difficult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range
of loss in some instances because litigation is subject to significant uncertainties. It is
possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be
materially affected by changes in assumptions, new developments or changes in approach, such as a
change in settlement strategy in dealing with litigation.

December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company has minimal reserves related to this matter; however, if claimant

action suit against PHS and the City of Philadelphia (the &#147;City&#148;) in the Court of Common Pleas of
Philadelphia County, Trial Division, seeking unspecified damages for the class, but damages in the
amount of approximately $10,000 individually. Plaintiff alleges that he provided services to
inmates in the Philadelphia Prison System at the request of the defendants and that the defendants
breached the alleged contractual duties owed to him by paying an amount alleged to be less than the
full amount plaintiff billed for his medical services. On September&nbsp;22, 2006, the City filed a New
Matter Crossclaim against PHS alleging breach of contract, negligence and seeking indemnification.
On September&nbsp;29, 2006, PHS filed its Answer to plaintiff&#146;s complaint, which Answer included a
crossclaim against the City for contribution and indemnification. The plaintiff filed his motion
for class certification on October&nbsp;1, 2007; and PHS and the City responded to this motion. On
January&nbsp;16, 2009, the trial court denied the plaintiff&#146;s motion for class certification. In May

Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center (&#147;St. Joseph&#146;s&#148;). Plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court of
New Jersey, Law Division: Passaic County, against CHS, Barnert Hospital, County of Bergen, Bergen
County Jail, County of Essex, Essex County Jail, County of Hudson, Hudson County Jail, County of

claims that CHS failed to administer various contracts with respect to medical claims for the
treatment of certain patients and the payment of such claims between each of the respective
counties and jails named in the complaint and Barnert Hospital, to which St. Joseph&#146;s claims it was
an intended third-party beneficiary. On August&nbsp;15, 2007, Barnert Hospital filed for Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy protection. As a result, the court has stayed the proceedings in the lawsuit pending
resolution of the bankruptcy. CHS intends to defend itself vigorously, and maintains that it is
not responsible for any payments that may be due and owing to the plaintiff. However, a judgment
adverse to CHS could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its
results of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company has no reserves associated with this

approximately $1.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and are primarily related to services performed by
PHS between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006 while PHS and the County were jointly seeking a
judicial interpretation of a contract dispute regarding whether the County had timely exercised its
first renewal option under its contract with PHS.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHS contended that the original term of its contract with the County expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005,
without the County exercising the first of three, two-year renewal options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, PHS
sent a letter to the County stating its position that PHS&#146; contract to provide services expired on
June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s failure to provide such extension notice. The County disputed
PHS&#146; contention asserting that it properly exercised the first renewal option and that the term of
the contract therefore was through June&nbsp;30, 2007, with extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In
July&nbsp;2005, the County and PHS agreed to have a judicial authority interpret the contract through
formal judicial proceedings (the &#147;Contract Matter&#148;). At the written request of the County, PHS
continued to provide healthcare services to the County from July&nbsp;1, 2005 to September&nbsp;14, 2006,
under the terms and conditions of the contested contract, pending the judicial resolution of the
Contract Matter, while reserving all of its rights. Finally, during September&nbsp;2006, amid
reciprocal claims of default, both PHS and the County took individual steps to terminate the
relationship between the parties. PHS contends that it terminated the relationship effective
September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to various breaches by the County, including failure to remit payment of
approximately $1.7&nbsp;million primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and
September&nbsp;14, 2006. On October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS initiated the Collection Matter lawsuit against the
County.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Collection Matter, although filed, was initially dormant, pending the resolution of the
Contract Matter. As discussed in more detail below, the Contract Matter was resolved in favor of
PHS on August&nbsp;26, 2008, when the Maryland Court of Appeals (the State&#146;s highest appellate court)
denied the County&#146;s request for a review of a Maryland Court of Special Appeals decision in favor
of PHS. After the resolution of the Contract Matter, the parties, during 2009, commenced the
discovery process on the Collection Matter. On March&nbsp;30, 2010, the court held a scheduling
conference in which the judge set February&nbsp;8, 2011 as the trial date for the Collection Matter.
Prior to the trial date, preliminary settlement discussions were conducted without resolution.
Subsequently, the parties agreed to forego the trial and resolve the Collection Matter through
binding arbitration which is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2011. PHS believes,
in the case of the Collection Matter, that it has a valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a
result, has concluded that the outstanding receivables, which represent services performed under
the relationship between the parties, continues to be probable of collection. However, although
PHS believes it has valid contractual and legal arguments, an adverse result in the Collection
Matter could have a negative impact on PHS&#146; ability to collect the outstanding receivable amount
and result in losses in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
2008, the Contract Matter, mentioned above, was resolved in the following manner. In
November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the County, with
respect to the Contract Matter, ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two-year
renewal option by sending a faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed
this ruling. On December&nbsp;6, 2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this
judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of
July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the case to the Circuit Court to determine whether the County
properly exercised the option by its conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally
decided by the Circuit Court. On May&nbsp;15, 2007, the Circuit Court, upon remand, held a hearing on
the parties&#146; pending cross motions for summary judgment. The Court issued an oral opinion at the
end of the hearing indicating its intention to rule in favor of the County&#146;s motion for summary
judgment and against PHS&#146; motion for summary judgment. On June&nbsp;6, 2007, the Court filed its order
memorializing the aforementioned ruling. In its order, the Court ruled that, by its actions, the
County properly and timely exercised the first two-year renewal option. The Company filed a Notice
of Appeal and on May&nbsp;14, 2008, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals issued its ruling that the
actions the County claimed constituted an exercise of renewal were ineffective. Accordingly, the
Court of Special Appeals reversed the Circuit Court&#146;s ruling and directed it to grant the Company&#146;s
motion for summary judgment in the lawsuit. On June&nbsp;27, 2008, the County petitioned the Maryland
Court of Appeals (the State&#146;s highest appellate court) to review the May&nbsp;14, 2008 Court of Special
Appeals decision. By order dated August&nbsp;26, 2008, the Court of Appeals denied the County&#146;s request
to review the decision, resulting in the ruling of the Court of Special Appeals in favor of the
Company becoming final, thereby bringing closure to the Contract Matter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company announced that its Audit Committee had concluded

that resulted in the recording of amounts due to SPP&#146;s customers that were not charged in
accordance with the terms of their respective contracts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholder Litigation. </I>On April&nbsp;6, 2006, plaintiffs filed the first of four similar
securities class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee against the Company and the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, at that time, and Chief
Financial Officer. Plaintiffs&#146; allegations in these class action lawsuits were substantially
identical and generally alleged on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased the
Company&#146;s common stock between September&nbsp;24, 2003 and March&nbsp;16, 2006 that, prior to the Company&#146;s
announcement of the Audit Committee investigation, the Company and/or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive
Officer, at that time, and Chief Financial Officer violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 by making false and misleading statements,
or concealing information about the Company&#146;s business, forecasts and financial performance. The
complaints sought certification as a class action, unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys&#146;
fees and costs, and other relief. By order dated August&nbsp;3, 2006, the district court consolidated
the lawsuits into one consolidated action and on October&nbsp;31, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended
complaint adding SPP, Enoch E. Hartman III and Grant J. Bryson as defendants. Enoch E. Hartman III
is a former employee of the Company and SPP and Grant J. Bryson is a former employee of SPP. The
amended complaint also generally alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements
concerning the Company&#146;s business which caused the Company&#146;s securities to trade at inflated prices
during the class period. Plaintiff sought an unspecified amount of damages in the form of (i)
restitution; (ii)&nbsp;compensatory damages, including interest; and (iii)&nbsp;reasonable costs and
expenses. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on January&nbsp;19, 2007, and the parties
completed the briefs on the motion in May&nbsp;2007. On March&nbsp;31, 2009, the Court ruled on the
defendants&#146; motion to dismiss, granting it in part and denying it in part. While the Court&#146;s
ruling dismissed significant portions of plaintiffs&#146; amended complaint and, as a result, narrowed
the scope of plaintiffs&#146; claims, none of the defendants were dismissed from the case and several of
plaintiffs&#146; claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and
SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 remained. The parties were not in agreement as to the scope of the Court&#146;s order
and defendants filed a motion to confirm which claims the Court dismissed in its March&nbsp;31, 2009
ruling. The Court granted defendants&#146; motion to confirm the scope of the dismissal order on July
20, 2009, ruling that certain of Plaintiff&#146;s claims had been in fact dismissed. The Court also
confirmed, however, that certain other claims remained viable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;22, 2009, the Court administratively closed the shareholder litigation case, while the
parties pursued mediation of this matter. On February&nbsp;19, 2010, the parties agreed to the terms of
a mediator&#146;s proposal to settle all of the claims in this lawsuit. At a hearing on October&nbsp;15,
2010, the Court approved the settlement, entering a final judgment and dismissing with prejudice
all claims against all defendant in the litigation. The settlement provided for payment by the
Company of $10.5&nbsp;million and issuance by the Company of 300,000 shares of common stock. The total
value of the settlement, based upon the Company&#146;s closing share price for its common stock of
$15.12 per share on October&nbsp;15, 2010, is approximately $15.0&nbsp;million. During the second quarter of
2010, the $10.5&nbsp;million cash component of the settlement was paid by the Company to the escrow
agent appointed by the Court. On October&nbsp;18, 2010, the Company issued 300,000 shares of its
common stock to the escrow agent appointed by the Court thereby fulfilling all terms of the
approved settlement. The Company considers this matter closed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009, the Company and its primary directors and officers liability (&#147;D&#038;O&#148;)
carrier reached an agreement under which the Company and the primary D&#038;O carrier mutually released
each other from future claims related to this matter and the primary D&#038;O carrier remitted insurance
proceeds to the Company totaling $8.0&nbsp;million, less approximately $0.4&nbsp;million in legal fees paid
by the primary D&#038;O carrier as of the settlement date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its primary D&#038;O carrier, with which the Company has settled all claims, the
Company also maintains D&#038;O insurance with an excess D&#038;O carrier that provides for additional
insurance coverage of up to $5.0&nbsp;million for losses in excess of $10.0&nbsp;million. The excess D&#038;O
carrier has denied coverage of this matter. After failing to reach agreement with the excess D&#038;O
carrier concerning the amount of their contribution to the settlement, the Company filed suit
against the excess D&#038;O carrier in the second quarter of 2010. This suit is currently in the
discovery phase.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Delaware Department of Justice Inquiry</I>. On April&nbsp;4, 2006, the Company received a letter
notifying it that the Office of the Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice is conducting
an inquiry into the indirect payment of claims by the Delaware Department of Correction to SPP
beginning in July&nbsp;2002 and ending in the spring of 2005 for pharmaceutical services. There can be
no assurance that the Delaware Department of Justice inquiry will not result in the Company
incurring additional investigation and related expenses; being required to make additional refunds;
incurring criminal, or civil penalties, including the imposition of fines; or being debarred from
pursuing future business in certain jurisdictions. Management of the Company is unable to predict
the effect that any such actions may have on its business, financial condition, results of
operations or stock price. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company received a written offer
from the Delaware Department of Justice to settle the inquiry in exchange for a cash payment. The
Company has reserves totaling $0.4&nbsp;million related to this matter which is the Company&#146;s estimate
of refund and associated interest due to the Delaware Department of Corrections, which was serviced
by a customer of SPP (see Note&nbsp;3).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s business ordinarily results in labor and employment related claims and matters,
actions for professional liability and related allegations of deliberate indifference in the
provision of healthcare and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services.
Therefore, in addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is a party to a multitude of
filed or pending legal and other proceedings incidental to its business. An estimate of the amounts
payable on existing claims for which the liability of the Company is probable and estimable is
included in accrued expenses. The Company is not aware of any unasserted claims that would have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Performance Bonds</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is required under certain contracts to provide a performance bond and may also be
required to post performance bonds for other business reasons. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company
had outstanding performance bonds totaling $6.6&nbsp;million. The performance bonds are renewed on an
annual basis. The Company is also dependant on the financial health of the surety companies that
it relies on to issue its performance bonds. An inability to obtain new or renew existing
performance bonds could result in limitations on the Company&#146;s ability to bid for new or renew
existing contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition
and results of operations.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;2, 2011, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06
per share on the Company&#146;s common stock for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2011. The dividend will be
paid on April&nbsp;12, 2011, to shareholders of record on March&nbsp;22, 2011.
Under the terms of the transaction discussed below, the Company is prohibited from paying
any additional dividends until the transaction is either closed or terminated.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;2, 2011, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger
Agreement&#148;) with Valit&#225;s Health Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Valit&#225;s&#148;), and Whiskey
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Valit&#225;s (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;),
providing for the acquisition of the Company by Valit&#225;s. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the &#147;Merger&#148;), with
the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Valit&#225;s.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the effective time of the Merger (the &#147;Effective Time&#148;), each share of common stock of the
Company that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares held by the Company, Valit&#225;s or any of their respective subsidiaries or shares held by
stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash, without interest (such per share
amount, the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;). As of the Effective Time, all such converted shares of common
stock of the Company shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each issued and outstanding option to purchase shares of Company common stock will vest in
full as of immediately prior to and contingent on the closing of the Merger, and each holder of an
option that has an exercise price per share that is less than the Merger Consideration will be
entitled to receive after the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the excess of the Merger
Consideration over such exercise price per share, in each case multiplied by the number of shares
of Company common stock underlying the option. Additionally, all restricted shares of Company
common stock that are subject to vesting or forfeiture conditions (whether time-based or
performance-based) that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
fully vested immediately prior to and contingent on the closing of the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights in favor of each party,
including rights allowing the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a
Superior Proposal. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances,
the Company will be required to pay to Valit&#225;s a specified fee and to reimburse Valit&#225;s for up to
$2.0&nbsp;million in transaction expenses. For instance, in the event that Valit&#225;s or the Company
exercises its rights to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, the Company will
be required to pay to Valit&#225;s a fee in the amount of $8.0&nbsp;million, plus transaction expenses.
However, if certain terminations result from the Company&#146;s acceptance of a Superior Proposal made
by an Excluded Party, then the fee payable to Valit&#225;s will be reduced to $4.5&nbsp;million, plus
transaction expenses.
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
consummation of the Merger is subject to certain customary
conditions, including, without limitation: (i)&nbsp;the
approval by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock
entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger; (ii)&nbsp;receipt of any required approvals or expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the &#147;HSR
Act&#148;); and (iii)&nbsp;the absence of any law or order prohibiting or otherwise making illegal the
Merger. Moreover, each party&#146;s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to certain other
conditions, including, without limitation: (i)&nbsp;the accuracy of the representations and warranties
made by the other party to the Merger Agreement, subject to customary
materiality qualifiers; and
(ii)&nbsp;the compliance by the other party with its obligations and preclosing covenants thereunder,
subject to customary materiality qualifiers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the disinterested members of
the Board of Directors, unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. The Merger is currently expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2011.
