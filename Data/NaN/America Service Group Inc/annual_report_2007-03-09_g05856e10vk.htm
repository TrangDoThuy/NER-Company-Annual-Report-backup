it intends to sell certain assets of SPP to Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corporation (&#147;Maxor&#148;).
The Company and Maxor are in the process of negotiating a definitive asset purchase agreement
providing for Maxor&#146;s purchase, at book value, of certain assets of SPP at closing, including certain
prepaid assets, inventory, information systems and other property and equipment. As part of the
proposed transaction, Maxor and PHS will enter into a long-term supply contract pursuant to which
Maxor will be the exclusive provider of pharmaceuticals and medical
supplies to PHS (except where prohibited by contract or for the
occasional use of local backup pharmacies).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;24, 2005, the Company announced that the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors
(the &#147;Audit Committee&#148;) had initiated an internal investigation into certain matters related to its
subsidiary, SPP. As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company announced that the Audit Committee
had concluded its investigation and reached certain conclusions with respect to findings of the
investigation that resulted in the recording of an accrual of $3.7&nbsp;million of aggregate refunds due
to customers that were not charged by SPP in accordance with the
terms of their respective contracts, including PHS. In circumstances
where SPP&#146;s incorrect billings resulted in PHS billing its
clients incorrectly, PHS passed the applicable amount through to its
clients. This amount plus associated interest
represented management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to affected customers, based on the
results of the Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has paid
approximately $3.1&nbsp;million of these refunds to customers plus associated interest and tendered the
remaining amounts for payment to the appropriate customers. The ultimate amounts paid could differ
from the Company&#146;s estimates; however, actual amounts to date have not differed materially from the
estimated amounts. There can be no assurance that the Company, a customer or a third-party,
including a governmental entity, will not assert that additional amounts, which may include
penalties are owed to these customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Correctional Healthcare Services</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, through PHS and CHS, contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies
to provide and/or administer healthcare services to inmates of prisons and jails. The Company&#146;s
revenues from correctional healthcare services are generated primarily by payments from
governmental entities, none of which are dependent on third party payment sources although they are
dependent on appropriate governmental funding. The Company provides and/or administers a wide range
of on-site healthcare programs, and arranges for and oversees off-site hospitalization and specialty outpatient care. The hospitalization and specialty outpatient care is performed by
third parties through arrangements with independent doctors and local hospitals. For
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, revenues from correctional healthcare services
accounted for 97.4%, 94.6% and 93.9%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s healthcare revenues from
continuing operations and discontinued operations combined. Required financial information related
to this business segment is set forth in Note 26 of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s target correctional market consists of state prison systems and county and local
jails. A prison is a facility in which an inmate is incarcerated for an extended period of time
(typically one year or longer). A jail is a facility in which the inmate is held for a shorter
period of time, often while awaiting trial or sentencing. The expected higher inmate turnover in
jails typically requires that healthcare be provided to a much larger number of individual inmates
over time and includes the costs associated with stabilizing and treating whatever health
conditions or injuries are present at the time of initial incarceration. As a result of the higher
number of individual inmate patient encounters and the greater likelihood of previously undiagnosed
acute healthcare needs associated with healthcare in jail settings, the severity and therefore
related costs of treating such patients, particularly with respect to professional liability costs,
are typically greater in jails as opposed to prison systems. Conversely, the costs of chronic
healthcare requirements are generally greater with respect to state prison contracts. State prison
contracts often cover a larger number of facilities and often have longer terms than jail
contracts<B>.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Services Provided and/or Administered. </I>Although the precise type of services to be provided
and/or administered by the Company vary depending on the specific terms of a contract, generally,
the Company&#146;s obligation to provide and/or administer medical services to a particular inmate
begins upon the inmate&#146;s booking into the correctional facility and ends upon the inmate&#146;s release.
In order to reduce costs and provide better care, emphasis is placed upon early identification of
serious injuries or illnesses so that prompt and clinically-effective treatment is commenced.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided and/or administered on-site may include physical and mental health
screening upon intake. Screening includes the compilation of the inmate&#146;s health history and the
identification of any current, chronic or acute healthcare needs. After

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">initial screening, services provided and/or administered may include regular physical and
dental screening and care, psychiatric care, OB-GYN screening and care and diagnostic testing.
Hospitalization is provided off-site at acute-care hospitals. Sick call is regularly conducted and
physicians, nurse practitioners, physicians&#146; assistants and others are also involved in the
delivery of care on a regular basis. Necessary medications are administered by clinical staff.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical services provided and/or administered off-site may include specialty outpatient
diagnostic testing and care, emergency room care, surgery and hospitalization. This care is
performed by third parties through arrangements with independent doctors and local
hospitals. In addition, the Company provides administrative support services on-site, at regional
offices and at the Company&#146;s headquarters. Administrative support services may include program
management, maintenance of on-site medical records and employee recruitment, scheduling, continuing
education and quality assurance, medical audits, credentialing, and clinical program development
activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Company&#146;s correctional contracts require it to staff the facilities it serves with
nurses 24 hours a day. Doctors at the facilities have regular hours and are generally available on
call. In addition, dentists, psychiatrists and other specialists are available on a routine basis
at facilities where correctional contracts cover such services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (&#147;NCCHC&#148;) and the American Correctional
Association (&#147;ACA&#148;) set standards for and offer accreditation
to facilities that meet their respective standards. These standards provide specific guidance
related to a service provider&#146;s operations including administration, personnel, support services
such as hospital care, regular services such as sick call, records management and medical and legal
issues. Accreditation with NCCHC and ACA standards is voluntary and includes many other aspects of
the operation of the correctional facility other than the healthcare component. As such, not all
of the Company&#146;s clients seek this accreditation. For those clients that do request the Company to
seek such accreditation, the Company believes it has a 100% success rate of obtaining and
maintaining accreditation with these organizations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCCHC, an independent not-for-profit organization initially formed by the American Medical
Association, was established to improve the quality of health care in jails, prisons, and juvenile
confinement facilities. NCCHC offers a voluntary health services accreditation program, through
external peer review to determine whether correctional institutions meet certain standards in their
provision of health services. NCCHC renders a professional judgment and assists in the improvement
of services provided and/or administered. The ACA, an independent not-for-profit organization, was
established to develop uniformity and industry standards for the operation of correctional
facilities and the provision of inmate healthcare. Accreditation involves an extensive audit and
compliance procedure, and is generally granted for a three-year period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contract Provisions. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions typically fall
into one of three general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee. For fixed
fee contracts, the Company&#146;s revenues are based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service
contract irrespective of inmate population. The Company&#146;s revenues for population-based contracts
are based either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for variances
in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or on a per diem rate multiplied by
the average or actual inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee contracts,
the Company&#146;s revenues are based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a
contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed fee or per diem based upon the
regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts that extend
beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of the Company&#146;s
costs of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. The Company often
bears the risk of increased or unexpected costs, which could result in reduced profits or cause it
to sustain losses when costs are higher than projected and increased profits when costs are lower
than projected. Certain contracts also contain financial penalties when performance and/or staffing
criteria are not achieved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a portion of the
Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in the majority
of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses, stop-loss provisions,
cost plus a fee arrangements or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of certain or all off-site
service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts.
Typically under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue under the contract increases
to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site expenses or pharmaceutical costs.
While such provisions serve to mitigate the Company&#146;s exposure to losses resulting from cost
fluctuations in the specified cost categories, the Company will still experience variances in its
gross margin percentage on these contracts as the additional revenue under these contract provisions is
typically equal to the additional costs incurred by the Company. Many contracts contain
termination clause provisions which allow either party to terminate the contract under agreed-upon
notice periods. The ability to terminate a contract serves to mitigate the Company&#146;s risk of
increasing costs of services being provided.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts accounting for approximately 9.8% of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services
revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 contain no limits on the
Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to off-site expenses, catastrophic illnesses or
injuries to inmates. However, none of these contracts has longer than one year remaining without a
termination provision.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when preparing bid proposals, the Company estimates the extent of its exposure to
cost increases, severe individual cases and catastrophic events and attempts to compensate for its
exposure in the pricing of its bids. The Company&#146;s management has experience in evaluating these
risks for bidding purposes and maintains an extensive database of historical experience.
Nonetheless, increased or unexpected costs against which the Company is not protected could render
a contract unprofitable. Furthermore, in an effort to manage risk under contracts that contain no
limits on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to off-site expenses, catastrophic
illnesses or injuries to inmates, the Company typically maintains stop loss insurance from an
unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital
expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in excess of $300,000 per inmate up to an annual
and a lifetime cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate. Amounts reimbursable per claim under the policy are
further limited to the lesser of 60% of billed charges, the amount paid or the contracted amounts
in situations where the Company has negotiated rates with the applicable providers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average length of a contract for services is generally one to three years, with subsequent
renewal options. In general, contracts may be terminated by the governmental agency, and often by
the Company as well, without cause at any time upon proper notice. The required notice period for
such contracts ranges from one day to six months, but is typically
between 60 and 120&nbsp;days.
Governmental agencies may be subject to political or financial influences that could lead to
termination of a contract through no fault of the Company. As with other governmental contracts,
the Company&#146;s contracts are subject to adequate budgeting and appropriation of funds by the
governing legislature or administrative body.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Administrative Systems. </I>The Company has centralized its administrative systems in order to
enhance economies of scale and to provide management with accurate, up-to-date field data for
forecasting purposes. These systems also enable the Company to refine its bids and help the Company
reduce the costs associated with the delivery of consistent healthcare.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a utilization review system to monitor the extent and duration of most
healthcare services required by inmates on an inpatient and outpatient basis. The current automated
utilization review program is an integral part of the services provided and/or administered at each
facility. The system is designed to ensure that the medical care rendered is medically necessary
and is provided safely in a clinically appropriate setting while maintaining traditional standards
of quality of care. The system provides for determinations of medical necessity by medical
professionals through a process of pre-authorization and concurrent review of the appropriateness
of any hospital stay. The system seeks to identify the maximum capability of on-site healthcare
units to allow for a more timely discharge from the hospital back to the correctional facility. The
utilization review staff consists of doctors and nurses who are supported by medical directors at
the regional and corporate levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed a variety of customized databases to facilitate and improve
operational review including (i)&nbsp;a claims management tracking system that monitors current
outpatient charges and inpatient stays, (ii)&nbsp;a comprehensive cost review system that analyzes the
Company&#146;s average costs per inmate at each facility including pharmaceutical utilization and trend
analysis available from SPP, and (iii)&nbsp;a daily operating report to manage off-site utilization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bid Process. </I>Contracts with governmental agencies are obtained primarily through a
competitive bidding process, which is governed by applicable state and local statutes and
ordinances. Although practices vary, typically a formal request for proposal (&#147;RFP&#148;), or similar
request or invitation, is issued by the governmental agency, stating the scope of work to be
performed, length of contract, performance bonding requirements, minimum qualifications of bidders,
selection criteria and the format to be followed in the bid or proposal. Usually, a committee
appointed by the governmental agency reviews bids and makes an award determination. The committee
may award the contract to a particular bidder or decide not to award the contract. The committees
consider a number of factors, including the technical quality of the proposal, the bid price and
the reputation of the bidder for providing quality care. The award of a contract may be subject to
formal or informal protest by unsuccessful bidders through a governmental appeals process. If the
committee does not award a contract, the correctional agency may, among various options, continue
to provide healthcare services to its inmates with its own personnel or the existing provider.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain RFPs and contracts require the bidder to post a bid bond or performance bond.
Performance bonding requirements may cover one year or up to the length of the contract. Due to
circumstances related to September&nbsp;11, 2001 and the collapse of certain major corporations, the
surety market has sharply contracted and the cost of surety bonds has substantially increased. In
order to avoid the additional costs that performance bonds add to the contracts, increasingly
clients are reducing or eliminating the need for performance bonds.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contractual and Regulatory Compliance. </I>The Company&#146;s contracts with governmental agencies
often require it to comply with numerous additional requirements regarding record-keeping and

private entities (including PHS) to distribute pharmaceuticals and certain medical supplies to
inmates of correctional facilities. SPP&#146;s contracts typically cover one year with renewals upon

SPP&#146;s clinical pharmacological management adds therapeutic value to services as well as fiscal
responsibility to its clients. In addition, SPP&#146;s medical supply service creates additional value
for its clients, as the packaging and delivery mode on certain products is advantageous to the
corrections environment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPP had fiscal year 2006 revenues of approximately $80.8&nbsp;million, $63.6&nbsp;million of which
related to services provided for PHS or CHS contracted sites, which are eliminated in

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental entities is highly
fragmented and competitive with few barriers to entry. The Company is in direct competition with
local, regional and national correctional healthcare providers including certain state medical
schools and other state or municipal organizations. The Company estimates that it has
approximately 7.5% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on its estimates of
national aggregate annual expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its primary
competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates has approximately 8.5%
of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., which the
Company estimates has approximately 2.5% of such market. As the private market for providing
correctional healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s competitors may gain additional experience in
bidding and administering correctional healthcare contracts. In addition, new competitors, some of
whom may have extensive experience in correctional healthcare, related fields or greater financial
resources than the Company, continue to enter the market.

subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations and/or orders of judicial authorities,
including healthcare, pharmaceutical and safety regulations and judicial orders, decrees and
judgments. Some of the regulations and orders are unique to the Company&#146;s industries, and the
combination of regulations and orders it faces is unique. Generally, prospective providers of
healthcare and pharmaceutical services to correctional facilities must be able to detail their
readiness to, and must comply with, a variety of applicable state and local regulations and
judicial orders. The Company&#146;s contracts typically include reporting requirements, supervision and
on-site monitoring by representatives of the contracting governmental agencies or courts. In
addition, the Company&#146;s doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals who provide
services on its behalf are in most cases required to obtain and maintain professional licenses and
are subject to state regulation regarding professional standards of conduct. The Company&#146;s services
are also subject to operational and financial audits by the governmental agencies with which the
Company has contracts and by the courts of competent jurisdiction. The Company may not always
successfully comply with these regulations or court orders and failure to comply can result in
material penalties, or non-renewal or termination of contracts with correctional facilities, or
prohibition from proposing for new business in certain jurisdictions.

encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. The Company does not electronically
file at present, but may do so in the future, subjecting it to all of the regulations of HIPAA.
HIPAA also includes regulations on standards to protect the security and privacy of health-related

operates have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations,
from employing physicians or laws that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments or
fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities. Possible
sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of a physician&#146;s license, civil and
criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements that may violate these restrictions.
These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and seldom have been interpreted by the
courts or regulatory agencies. The Company reviews, on an ongoing basis, the applicable laws in
each state in which the Company operates and reviews its arrangements with its healthcare providers
to ensure that these arrangements comply with all applicable laws. The Company has no assurance
that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that the Company,
or transactions in which it is involved, are in violation of such laws, or that such laws
ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with the Company&#146;s
interpretations.

combined for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The Company&#146;s Alabama Department of Corrections,
Florida Department of Corrections, Region IV, and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Corrections
contracts accounted for approximately 8.5%, 9.6% and 10.5%, respectively, of the healthcare

management and administrative services with respect to the provision of comprehensive medical,
mental health, dental and ancillary services to inmates in the custody of the New York City
Department of Correction. The three-year &#147;cost plus fixed fee&#148; contract commenced on January&nbsp;1,
2005 and may be extended by the client for an additional term of three
years. The Company is subject
to mandatory staffing and other performance requirements under the contract. NYCDOH is required to indemnify the Company
and its employees and independent contractors for damages for personal injuries and/or death
alleged to have been sustained by an inmate by reason of malpractice, except where the Company&#146;s
employees or independent contractors have engaged in intentional misconduct or a criminal act.
Either party may terminate the contract without cause at any time
upon two months notice. Either
party may terminate on ten days&#146; notice for a material breach of the contract subject to certain
cure provisions.

DOC&#148;) on September&nbsp;1, 2003, for a period of five years for medical services exclusive of mental
health and pharmacy. The contract covers each of the 27 Pennsylvania state prison system
facilities. The Pennsylvania DOC pays the Company a flat rate per month, which is adjusted for
changes in inmate population levels. Under the terms of the contract, the Company is reimbursed
for the costs of the medical malpractice insurance related to this contract and its exposure to
off-site medical costs related to this contract is limited to a specified maximum amount. Pharmacy
and mental health services are provided by separate contractors to the Pennsylvania DOC. The
contract also contains provisions that allow the Pennsylvania DOC to assess penalties if certain
staffing criteria are not maintained. The Pennsylvania DOC may terminate the contract on six
months&#146; notice. The Company may terminate the contract without cause subject to a nine month
notice being delivered to the Pennsylvania DOC.

November&nbsp;3, 2003. The initial term of the contract expired on
October 31, 2006. On March 2, 2007, an amendment to the contract
became effective whereby the parties extended the contract by the
first of two, one year renewal periods, or through October 31, 2007. The
contract calls for PHS to provide comprehensive medical services to each of the 13 Alabama state prison system facilities and the work release programs
associated with each facility. Pursuant to the contract as amended,
the Alabama DOC pays PHS a flat rate per month based on the
contract specified amounts per year and PHS&#146;s exposure for
pharmaceutical costs related to the treatment of HIV and off-site
medical costs related to the contract is limited to a specified
maximum amount. PHS has no liability for the costs of psychotropic
pharmaceuticals or pharmaceuticals related to the treatment of
Hepatitis C. The contract also contains provisions that allow the

comprehensive and medically necessary medical, dental and mental health care services with related
pharmacy services (including provision of pharmaceuticals) on a capitation basis to the Florida
Department of Corrections&#146; inmates located in all of its Region IV facilities. The contract term
began on January&nbsp;1, 2006 and contained a provision allowing the Company to terminate the contract
for any reason without cause, upon 90&nbsp;days notice. On August&nbsp;21, 2006, the Company
formally delivered its notice to terminate the contract; such termination was effective on November
20, 2006. During its term, the contract underperformed financially, primarily due to a higher than
anticipated volume of off-site hospitalization services required for the patient population. The
results of operations for this contract are classified as discontinued operations in the Company&#146;s

financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially and

immaterial by the Company, may also constrain its business and operations. In either case, the
trading price of the Company&#146;s common stock could decline and stockholders could lose all or part

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Potential Additional Refunds. </I>As a result of the internal investigation described in Item&nbsp;1.
&#147;Business &#151; Audit Committee Investigation,&#148; the Audit Committee determined that, in certain
instances, SPP did not charge its customers in accordance with applicable contracts. As a result,
the Company recorded accruals to provide aggregate refunds to customers of approximately $3.7
million, covering all periods since the Company&#146;s acquisition of SPP in September&nbsp;2000, plus
interest at the applicable federal rate (which ranged from 4% to 9%) during the period covered by
the investigation. These amounts represented management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to
affected customers based on the Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. However, there can be no
assurance that the Company, a customer or a third-party, including a governmental entity, will not
assert that additional amounts, which may include penalties are owed to these customers and, that
as the result of such assertions, the Company will not incur additional investigation and related
expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Potential Enforcement Actions</I>. The Company could be the subject of future government
investigations, enforcement actions or penalties. As previously and currently disclosed, the
Company is currently the subject of informal inquiries by both the SEC and the U.S. Attorney for
the Middle District of Tennessee with respect to those matters that were the subject of the Audit
Committee&#146;s internal investigation. In addition, the Company has received notice from the Delaware
Department of Justice that it is currently conducting an inquiry into the payment of claims by the
Delaware Department of Correction to SPP for pharmaceutical services (see Note 23 of the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements and Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;). Both the Audit Committee and
the Company have cooperated and intend to continue to cooperate fully with these government
entities regarding such inquiries. However, there can be no assurance that either the SEC, the
U.S. Attorney, the Delaware Attorney General or any other governmental authority (including,
without limitation, the governmental entities with which the Company entered into contractual
relationships) will not take any action that would adversely affect the Company as a result of the
matters investigated by the Audit Committee. Such actions could result in criminal, civil or other
penalties, including the imposition of fines, the termination of existing contracts, the debarment
from pursuing future business in certain jurisdictions or additional restatements of the Company&#146;s
financial statements. Management of the Company is unable to predict the effect that any such
actions may have on its business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.

action was dismissed on July 27, 2006 (see Note 23 of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements
and Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;). However, the Company and its current or former directors or
officers could be named defendants in future shareholder class actions or shareholder derivative
lawsuits. Management of the Company is unable to predict the effect that the current or any future
lawsuits may have on its business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Company believes that it has meritorious liability and damages defenses to the
securities class action and intends to defend it vigorously, it is unable at this time to predict
the outcome of this action or reasonably estimate a range of possible damages. The Company
maintains directors and officers liability (&#147;D&#038;O&#148;) insurance that may provide coverage for some or
all of these matters. It has given notice to its D&#038;O insurers of the claims described above. There
is risk that some or all of the claims will not be covered by such policies; or that, even if
covered, the Company&#146;s ultimate liability will exceed the available limits of insurance.
Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the
Company&#146;s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or stock price.

identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. These material
weaknesses are described in Item&nbsp;9A. &#147;Controls and Procedures&#148; of this report. Although the
Company has taken numerous steps to remediate these material weaknesses and the Company&#146;s
management has concluded that such material weaknesses no longer exist as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, it
cannot assure you that deficiencies or weaknesses in its controls and procedures will not be
identified in the future or that the material weaknesses previously identified and remediated will
not become ineffective in the future. The material weaknesses previously identified, as well as
any other weaknesses or deficiencies that might be identified in the future, could harm the
Company&#146;s business and operating results, and could result in adverse publicity and a loss in
investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports.

from contracts with state, county and local governmental agencies. Generally, contracts may be
terminated by the governmental agency without cause upon proper
notice (typically between 60 and

termination of a contract or failure to renew or extend a contract through no fault of the Company.

are put out for bid are subject to intense competition. As a result, the Company&#146;s portfolio of
contracts is subject to change. The changes in the Company&#146;s portfolio of contracts are largely
unpredictable, which creates uncertainties about the amount of its total revenues from period to
period. The Company must engage in competitive bidding for new business to replace contracts that
expire or are terminated. The Company, therefore, has no assurance that it will be able to replace
contracts that expire or are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or otherwise. The
non-renewal or termination of any of the Company&#146;s contracts with governmental agencies could
materially affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company relies on a small number of client contracts for a significant
portion of its revenues. The combined revenues of the Company&#146;s
Rikers Island, New York, Alabama Department of Corrections, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department
of Corrections and Florida Department of Corrections, Region IV,
contracts accounted for
approximately 45% of the healthcare revenues from
continuing and discontinued operations combined for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006. The loss of any of these contracts could have
a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. For more information on the Company&#146;s
significant contracts, see Item 1. &#147;Business &#151; Major
Contracts.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Government Funding. </I>The Company&#146;s cash flow is subject to the receipt of
sufficient funding of, and timely payment by, the government entities with which it contracts.
Economic circumstances at the national, state or local level could affect government entity
budgets, which could result in insufficient funding, increased pricing pressure or termination of
contracts. If a government entity does not receive sufficient funding to cover its obligations
under a healthcare services contract, the contract may be terminated and payment for the Company&#146;s
services could be delayed or not occur. The termination of contracts, a significant delay in
payment or non-payment could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations or cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Privatization of Government Services and Correctional Population. </I>The Company&#146;s future
revenue growth will depend in part on continued privatization by state, county and local
governmental agencies of healthcare services for correctional facilities. The Company believes,
based on its internally built projections, that approximately $15&nbsp;million to $20&nbsp;million in
annualized correctional healthcare contract revenues were newly privatized in 2006 by governmental
agencies either for the first time or as a result of the expansion of existing contracted services
to encompass additional or expanded services. There can be no assurance that this market will
continue to grow at historical rates or at all, or that existing contracts will continue to be made
available to the private sector. Revenue growth could also be adversely affected by material
decreases in the inmate population of correctional facilities. Any of these results could cause
the Company&#146;s revenue to decline and harm its business and operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Negative Publicity</I>. Negative publicity regarding the provision of correctional healthcare
services by for-profit companies, including the Company, or specific
alleged actions or inactions of the Company could adversely affect the Company&#146;s
results of operations or business. Privatization of healthcare services for correctional
facilities may encounter resistance from groups or constituencies that believe that healthcare
services to correctional facilities should only be provided by governmental agencies. Negative
publicity regarding the privatization of correctional healthcare services or specific
alleged actions or inactions of the Company may result in increased
regulation and legislative review of industry practices that further increase the Company&#146;s costs
of doing business and adversely affect its results of operations by:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Compliance with Government Regulations</I>. Failure to comply with governmental regulations

industry in which the Company operates is subject to extensive federal, state and local
regulations, including educational, health care, pharmacy and safety regulations and judicial
orders, decrees and judgments. Some of the regulations are unique to the Company&#146;s industry, and
the combination of regulations it faces is unique. Generally, providers of healthcare and
pharmaceutical services to correctional facilities must be able to detail their readiness to, and
must comply with, a variety of applicable state and local regulations and court orders. The
Company&#146;s contracts typically include reporting requirements, supervision and on-site monitoring by
representatives of the contracting governmental agencies or courts. The Company may not always
successfully comply with these regulations or court orders, and failure to comply can result in
material penalties, sanctions or non-

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Governmental Agency Investigations and Audits. </I>Certain of the governmental agencies with
which the Company contracts have the authority to audit and investigate its contracts with them. As
part of that process, government agencies may review the Company&#146;s performance of the contract, its
pricing practices, its cost structure and its compliance with applicable laws, regulations and
standards. For contracts that actually or effectively provide for certain reimbursement of
expenses, if an agency determines that the Company has improperly allocated costs to a specific
contract, it may not be reimbursed for those costs, and it could be required to refund the amount
of any such costs that have been reimbursed. If a government audit asserts improper or illegal
activities by the Company, it may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative
sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments,
fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with certain government entities. Any
adverse determination could adversely impact the Company&#146;s ability to bid in response to RFPs in
one or more jurisdictions. Additionally, as a result of these governmental agency investigations
and audits, the Company&#146;s collections of balances due from its customers could be substantially
delayed. For more information on the Company&#146;s risk of accounts receivable collection, see the
section titled &#147;Collectibility of Accounts Receivable&#148; below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Competition. </I>The business of providing correctional healthcare services to governmental
agencies is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. The Company is in direct competition
with local, regional and national correctional healthcare providers including certain state medical
schools and other state or municipal organizations. The Company estimates that it has
approximately 7.5% of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, based on its estimates of
national aggregate annual expenditures on correctional healthcare services. Its primary
competitors are Correctional Medical Services, which the Company estimates has approximately 8.5%
of the combined privatized and non-privatized market, and Wexford Health Sources, Inc., which the
Company estimates has approximately 2.5% of such market. As the private market for providing
correctional healthcare matures, the Company&#146;s competitors may gain additional experience in
bidding and administering correctional healthcare contracts. Competitors may use the additional
experience to underbid the Company. In addition, new competitors, some of whom may have extensive
experience in related fields or greater financial resources than the Company, may enter the market.
Increased competition could result in a loss of contracts and market share and could seriously
harm the Company&#146;s business and operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Acquisitions. </I>The Company&#146;s expansion strategy involves both internal growth and, as
opportunities become available, acquisitions. The inability to successfully integrate future
acquisitions may seriously harm the Company&#146;s business or operating revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Exposure to Catastrophic Events. </I>Contracts accounting for approximately 9.8% of the Company&#146;s
correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December
31, 2006 contain no limits on the Company&#146;s exposure for treatment costs related to catastrophic
illnesses or injuries to inmates. Although the Company attempts to compensate for the increased
financial risk when pricing contracts that do not contain catastrophic limits and has not had any
catastrophic illnesses or injuries to inmates that exceeded its insurance coverage in the past,
there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience a catastrophic illness or injury of
a patient that exceeds its coverage in the future. The occurrence of severe individual cases
outside of those catastrophic limits could render contracts unprofitable and could have a material
adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Key Personnel. </I>The success of the Company depends in large part on the ability
and experience of its senior management. The loss of services of one or more key employees could
adversely affect the Company&#146;s business and operating results. The Company has employment contracts
with Michael Catalano, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lawrence H. Pomeroy, Senior
Vice President and Chief Development Officer; Michael W. Taylor, Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer; and Richard Hallworth, Chief Operating Officer and
the President and Chief Executive Officer of PHS, as well as
certain other key personnel. The Company does not maintain key man life insurance on any member of
its senior management.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Healthcare Personnel. </I>The Company faces stiff competition for staffing, which
may increase its labor, professional liability and other costs
(including contractually mandated penalties) and reduce profitability. The
Company competes with other healthcare and service providers in recruiting qualified management and
staff personnel for the day-to-day operations of its business, including nurses and other
healthcare professionals. In some markets, the scarcity of
physicians, nurses and other medical support
personnel is a significant operating issue to healthcare businesses. This scarcity may require the
Company to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified nurses and other healthcare
professionals. Because a significant percentage of the Company&#146;s existing contracts are structured
as fixed fee and/or population based contracts, the Company&#146;s
ability to pass along increased labor costs is limited. If the Company is not successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient
number of qualified healthcare personnel in the future, it may not be able to perform under its
contracts, which could lead to the loss of existing contracts or its ability to gain new contracts.
Moreover, lack of success in this area could further result in the provision of negligent
healthcare services or in the provision of untimely healthcare services, or in the allegation of such
negligent or untimely services (whether valid or invalid), any or all of which could increase the
Company&#146;s exposure to professional liability, medical,
pharmaceutical or other expenses. See the section titled, &#147;Corporate Exposure
to Professional Liability and Insurance Costs&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">below. Additionally, approximately 47% of the Company&#146;s contracts contain financial penalties
that apply when performance or staffing criteria are not achieved. For the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2006, the Company incurred revenue deductions related to these criteria totaling approximately $1.3
million, or 0.2% of the Company&#146;s healthcare revenues from continuing operations and discontinued
operations combined.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Corporate Exposure to Professional Liability and Insurance Costs. </I>The Company&#146;s business
ordinarily results in the Company becoming involved in actions for medical malpractice and other
claims related to the provision of healthcare services with the attendant risk of substantial
damage awards, or court endorsed non-monetary relief such as changes in operating practices or
procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in the Company&#146;s operating
expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits
brought by inmates (or their successors) alleging negligent healthcare services or the lack of timely adequate healthcare
services. The Company may also be liable, as employer, for the negligence of healthcare
professionals it employs or healthcare professionals or entities with whom it contracts. All but
one of the Company&#146;s contracts generally provide for the Company to indemnify the governmental
agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the Company and its agents. The
Company maintains professional and general liability insurance;
however, due to the use of adjustable premium policies in 2002
through 2006, with respect to a majority of its inmates, the Company is effectively self-insured for professional liability claims incurred under
its primary program. In addition to its primary program, the Company
also has traditional risk transfer insurance policies
that relate to certain specific healthcare services contracts. Many of the Company&#146;s independent contractors maintain professional
liability insurance in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon the Company&#146;s claims
history and the nature and risks of its business. However, the
Company does indemnify and pay for coverage for some of its
independent contractors. Management establishes reserves for
the estimated losses that will be incurred under or in excess of these insurance policies after
taking into consideration internal and external counsel evaluations of the merits of the individual
claims, analysis of claim history, the estimated reserves recommended by the Company&#146;s
third-party administrator and independent actuarial analysis. However, there can be no assurance that a future
claim or claims will not exceed management&#146;s loss estimates or the limits of available insurance
coverage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate
levels of malpractice and other liability insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable price. The Company
is dependent on the financial health of the insurance carriers with whom it has insurance policies.
Substantially all of the Company&#146;s contracts require the Company to be insured at certain levels.
Failure to obtain sufficient levels of professional liability insurance or deterioration in an
insurance carrier&#146;s financial health may expose the Company to significant financial or contractual
losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Information Systems. </I>The Company depends on its information technology systems
for timely and accurate information. Failure to maintain effective and efficient information
technology systems or disruptions in the Company&#146;s information technology systems could cause
disruptions in its business operations, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new
customers, disputes with customers and providers, potential regulatory problems, increases in
administrative expenses and other adverse consequences.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dependence on Credit Facility. </I>The Company&#146;s debt consists of a credit facility dated October
31, 2005 with CapitalSource Finance LLC. The Company is dependent on the availability of
borrowings pursuant to this credit facility to meet its working capital needs, capital expenditure
requirements and other cash flow requirements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credit facility requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants related to
minimum levels of earnings. The financial covenants contained in the credit facility are described
in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151;
Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. At December&nbsp;31,
2006, the Company was not in compliance with one of the covenant requirements and has obtained a
waiver of the debt covenant. Should the Company fail to meet its projected results, fail to remain
in compliance with the terms of the credit facility or fail to obtain
a waiver, amendment or other curative document in the event of
default, it may be forced to seek alternative sources of financing. No assurances can be made that
the Company can obtain alternative financing arrangements on terms acceptable to it, or at all.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Inflation</I>. Some of the Company&#146;s contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed base fee
based upon changes in the regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all
other contracts that extend beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future
inflation rate of its cost of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years.
If inflation exceeds projected levels, depending on the contract structure, the Company&#146;s
profitability could be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Performance Bonds. </I>The Company is required under certain contracts to provide a performance
bond. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had outstanding performance bonds totaling $12.0&nbsp;million.
The performance bonds are renewed on an annual basis. The market for performance bonds was
severely impacted by certain corporate failures in recent years and the events of September&nbsp;11,
2001 and continues to be impacted by general economic conditions. Consequently, the sureties for
the Company&#146;s performance bond program may require additional collateral to issue or renew
performance bonds in support of certain contracts. The Company has letters of credit in the
amount of $5.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 that collateralize these performance bonds, reduce
availability under the Company&#146;s credit facility and limit funds available for debt service and
working capital. The Company is also dependant on the financial health of the surety companies
that it relies on to issue its performance bonds. An inability to obtain new or renew

cause the Company&#146;s stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Lake Professional Liability Suit. </I>On July&nbsp;15, 2005, EMSA, a limited partnership owned by the
Company, received an adverse jury verdict in United States District Court for the Northern District
of New York in Albany, New York. The verdict relates to a claim regarding the plaintiff&#146;s medical
care while incarcerated in the Schoharie and Schenectady County, New York jails in December&nbsp;1998,
prior to the Company&#146;s acquisition of EMSA in 1999. The adverse verdict consisted of an indemnity
award to plaintiff of $150,000 to be allocated among four defendants and an assessment of punitive
damages totaling approximately $633,000 against EMSA. EMSA subsequently filed post-trial motions
challenging the appropriateness and amounts of the verdict. On January&nbsp;3, 2006, the trial court
entered a judgment as a matter of law in favor of EMSA that had the effect of dismissing the
verdict for punitive damages against EMSA in its entirety. The indemnity award was unaffected by
such ruling and still stands as entered. The plaintiff has appealed this ruling in favor of EMSA.
EMSA is vigorously defending the appeal. If EMSA is not successful and the punitive damages
verdict is reinstated, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial
position and its quarterly or annual results of operations. EMSA is appealing the underlying
indemnity award against it. Plaintiff has also requested prevailing party attorney fees in excess
of $225,000 (and increasing as the appeal proceeds), which EMSA is contesting vigorously. The
Company&#146;s exposure related to the indemnity award is covered under its professional liability
program. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has no separate legal reserves associated with this
proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>EMSA lease matter. </I>On July&nbsp;12, 2004, EMSA received an unexpected adverse jury verdict in the
Circuit Court, 11<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> Judicial Circuit, Miami-Dade County, Florida of
approximately $1.2&nbsp;million plus potential interest which has the potential to double the amount of
the award to $2.5&nbsp;million. This verdict relates to a 12&nbsp;year old case filed by the plaintiff,
Community Health Related Services, Inc. (&#147;CHRS&#148;) seeking unspecified damages involving a lease
dispute in connection with a line of business managing physician clinics operated by EMSA prior to
its acquisition by the Company in 1999. However, on December&nbsp;9, 2005, the trial court granted
EMSA&#146;s post trial motion for Judgment in Accordance with Motion for Directed Verdict, which had the
effect of setting aside the above-referenced jury verdict, and entered a judgment in favor of EMSA
and against CHRS. In addition, the trial court ruled that in the event its ruling dismissing the
jury verdict was reversed on appeal, EMSA would then be entitled to a new trial. As of December
31, 2006, the Company has no reserves associated with this proceeding. CHRS has filed an Appeal in
the Florida Third District Court of Appeal. EMSA is vigorously defending the appeal. In the event
both trial court rulings set forth above are overturned, the original verdict against EMSA could be
reinstated. Alternatively, if the jury verdict is reversed on appeal and EMSA receives a new
trial, EMSA could receive an adverse verdict at the conclusion of such new trial. Either such
occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its
quarterly or annual results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the Company has filed suit against Caremark Rx, Inc. (&#147;Caremark&#148;), the successor
to the party who sold EMSA to the Company, for indemnification for all costs associated with this
case as well as any judgment returned which is adverse to the Company. Caremark is defending this
lawsuit and the trial court has stayed all proceedings until final resolution of the above
referenced CHRS matter is reached. Accordingly, the Company does not know whether it will prevail
against Caremark.

Inc. </I>On August&nbsp;1, 2005, Plaintiff, Albert Einstein Healthcare Network, filed suit against the City
of Philadelphia and PHS in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, seeking damages in the
amount of $1.7&nbsp;million (plus interest) and punitive damages in the amount of $0.5&nbsp;million.
Plaintiff alleges that it rendered medical and/or surgical services to prisoners/arrestees for
which the defendants were obligated to pay pursuant to an implied contract resulting from an
extended course of dealing. Plaintiff alleges that defendants have failed to pay for such
services. Plaintiff further has alleged that PHS, in acting as the City of Philadelphia&#146;s third
party administrator, fraudulently withheld payment for such services from Plaintiff. On December
27, 2005, the trial court dismissed Plaintiff&#146;s punitive damages claim. PHS believes that it has
viable affirmative defenses and cross claims as to this cause of action. However, in the event PHS
is not successful at the trial court level, an adverse judgment could have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has no reserves associated with this proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County, Indiana v. Prison Health Services, Inc.</I>
On or about April&nbsp;12, 2006, Plaintiff, The Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County,
Indiana filed suit against PHS in the Marion County (Indiana) Superior Court, Civil Division,
seeking damages in the amount of approximately $1.1&nbsp;million plus all allowable interest, costs and
fees. Plaintiff alleges that, pursuant to a contract between Plaintiff and PHS, Plaintiff provided
medical care to prisoners of the Indiana Department of Corrections; services for which PHS is
financially responsible. Plaintiff alleges that PHS has failed to pay for such services. PHS has accrued for the costs associated
with these services, net of customary adjustments made in
the claims adjudication process (the &#147;Accrued Amount&#148;), which Accrued Amount PHS believes reflects
the amount, if any, owed to the Plaintiff. However, irrespective of the aforementioned accrual,
PHS believes it has amounts due from the Plaintiff that if recouped would offset substantially all
of the Accrued Amount. Such amounts due are the result of the Plaintiff&#146;s overbilling and PHS&#146;
resulting overpayment for services unrelated to those that are the subject of the lawsuit. As a
result, PHS believes that it has viable defenses and counterclaims as to this cause of action. However, in the
event PHS is not successful at the trial court level, an adverse judgment could have a material
adverse affect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of
operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Andrew Berkowitz, M.D., Individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Prison
Health Services, Inc. and City of Philadelphia. </I>On or about August&nbsp;2, 2006, Plaintiff, an
individual physician independent contractor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a putative class
action suit against PHS and the City of Philadelphia in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia
County, Trial Division, seeking unspecified damages for the class, but damages in the amount of at
least $9,588 individually. Plaintiff alleges that he provided services to inmates in the
Philadelphia Prison System at the request of the defendants and that the defendants breached the
alleged contractual duties owed to him by paying an amount alleged to be less than the full amount
Plaintiff billed for his medical services. On September&nbsp;22, 2006, the City of Philadelphia filed a
New Matter Crossclaim against PHS alleging breach of contract, negligence and seeking
indemnification. On September&nbsp;29, 2006, PHS filed its Answer to Plaintiff&#146;s complaint, which
Answer included a crossclaim against the City of Philadelphia for contribution and indemnification.
PHS believes that it has viable defenses as to the certification of this action as a class action
and as to the substantive claims of these causes of action. However, in the event PHS is not
successful at the trial court level, an adverse judgment could have a material adverse affect on
the Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations. As of December
31, 2006, the Company has no reserves associated with this proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Saint Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center v. Correctional Health Services, et al. </I>On or
about February&nbsp;8, 2007, the Company&#146;s subsidiary, CHS, was served with a lawsuit by Plaintiff,
Saint Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center. Plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court of New Jersey,
Law Division: Passaic County, against CHS, Barnert Hospital, County of Bergen, Bergen County Jail,
County of Essex, Essex County Jail, County of Hudson, Hudson County Jail, County of Passaic and
Passaic County Jail, &#147;John Does #1-30&#148;, &#147;ABC Corporations #1-30&#148;, &#147;XYZ Jails, Prisons and/or
Detention Centers&#148; seeking damages from CHS totaling approximately $2.5&nbsp;million. Plaintiff
claims that CHS failed to administer various contracts with respect to the medical claims for the
treatment of certain patients and the payment of such claims between each of the respective
counties and jails named in the complaint and Barnert Hospital, to which St. Joseph claims it was
an intended third-party beneficiary. CHS intends to defend itself vigorously, however, the
proceedings are at a preliminary stage and the Company is unable to predict the ultimate
outcome. However, a judgment adverse to CHS could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Matters involving PHS and Baltimore County, Maryland. </I>PHS is currently involved in three
lawsuits with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;). The first lawsuit
involves the term of PHS&#146; contract with the County. PHS contends that the original term of this
contract expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005, without the County exercising the first of three, two-year
renewal options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, PHS sent a letter to the County stating its position that PHS&#146;
contract to provide services expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s failure to provide such
extension notice. The County is disputing PHS&#146; contention and has asserted that it properly
exercised the first renewal option and that the term of the contract therefore was through June&nbsp;30,
2007, with extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In 2005, the County and PHS agreed to have a
judicial authority interpret the contract through formal

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">judicial proceedings, and, at the County&#146;s request, PHS continued to provide healthcare
services to the County pending the judicial resolution of the dispute, while reserving all of its
rights. Finally, during September&nbsp;2006, amid reciprocal claims
of default, both PHS and the County took individual steps to terminate
the relationship between (or the contract, if it is ultimately determined to be in effect by the court in the proceeding discussed above) the parties. PHS contends that it terminated the
relationship effective September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to various breaches by the County.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the
County ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two year renewal option by sending a
faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed this ruling. On December&nbsp;6,
2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County
did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the
case to the district court to determine whether the County properly exercised the option by its
conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally decided by the trial court. PHS plans to
vigorously pursue its case with respect to this issue and feels that it has
valid arguments in its favor. However, in the event PHS is not
ultimately successful and the court determines that the contract was renewed due to the conduct of the County prior
to June&nbsp;30, 2005, such an adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect on the other two
suits between the County and PHS (which are discussed below) and therefore on the Company&#146;s
financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second lawsuit revolves around the County&#146;s actions on or about May&nbsp;5, 2006, when it
opened a new detention facility. PHS is of the opinion that this new facility increased the
staffing and equipment required to service the County contract in a material fashion not
contemplated by the initial contract. The County informed PHS that it expected PHS to provide the
same services at the new facility at no increase in price. Accordingly, on or about July&nbsp;12, 2006,
PHS filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against the County in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore County, Maryland seeking to have the Court declare that PHS is under no obligation to
provide personnel or services to the County at the new facility. During the pendency of this
second lawsuit, PHS was providing services at the new facility under a reservation of rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally,
as a result of the termination discussed above and the
County&#146;s claims of default,
as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, PHS has approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of receivables due from this former
client, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006. The
County has refused to pay PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS filed suit
against the County in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of the
outstanding receivable balances and damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit and unjust
enrichment. PHS believes, in the case of the lawsuit filed in October&nbsp;2006 that it has a valid and
meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the outstanding receivables, which
represent services performed under the relationship between the
parties, are probable of
collection. However, although PHS believes it has valid
contractual and legal arguments, an adverse result in either or both
of the two declaratory judgment actions could
have a negative impact on PHS&#146; ability to collect the outstanding receivable amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the three suits is currently separate and distinct; however, the ultimate resolution
of any of these suits could influence the ultimate outcome of the remaining suits. Should PHS be
unsuccessful in any or all of these suits, such result could have a
material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results
of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company announced that its Audit Committee had concluded
its investigation and reached certain conclusions with respect to findings of the investigation
that resulted in the recording of amounts due to SPP&#146;s customers that were not charged in
accordance with the terms of their respective contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>SEC and United States Attorney Informal Inquiries. </I>As previously reported, the Company
contacted the SEC to inform it of the existence of the internal investigation conducted by the
Audit Committee and the issues being investigated, and, since that time, the Company has cooperated
with the SEC in an informal inquiry that it is conducting as well as with the Office of the U. S.
Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee in the informal inquiry it is conducting. Both the
Audit Committee and the Company intend to continue to cooperate with those government entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholder Litigation. </I>On April&nbsp;6, 2006, plaintiffs filed the first of four similar
securities class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee against the Company and the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. Plaintiffs&#146; allegations in these class action lawsuits are substantially identical and
generally allege on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased the Company&#146;s common
stock between September&nbsp;24, 2003 and March&nbsp;16, 2006 that, prior to the Company&#146;s announcement of
the Audit Committee investigation, the Company and/or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934 and SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 by making false and misleading statements, or concealing information about
the Company&#146;s business, forecasts and financial performance. The complaints seek certification as

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">other relief. By order dated August&nbsp;3, 2006, the district court consolidated the lawsuits
into one consolidated action and on October&nbsp;31, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding
SPP, Enoch E. Hartman III and Grant J. Bryson as defendants. The amended complaint also generally
alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements concerning the Company&#146;s business
which caused the Company&#146;s securities to trade at inflated prices during the class period.
Plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of damages in the form of (i)&nbsp;restitution; (ii)&nbsp;compensatory
damages, including interest; and (iii)&nbsp;reasonable costs and expenses. Defendants moved to dismiss
the amended complaint on January&nbsp;19, 2007, and the Company expects briefing on the motion to be
complete by May&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Company believes that it has meritorious liability and damages defenses to the
securities class action and intends to defend it vigorously, it is unable at this time to predict
the outcome of this action or reasonably estimate a range of possible damages. The Company
maintains directors and officers liability (&#147;D&#038;O&#148;) insurance that may provide coverage for some or
all of these matters. It has given notice to its D&#038;O insurers of the claims described above. There
is risk that some or all of the claims will not be covered by such policies; or that, even if
covered, the Company&#146;s ultimate liability will exceed the available limits of insurance.
Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the
Company&#146;s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or stock price.

Catalano and Michael W. Taylor and former and current Company directors, William D. Eberle, Burton
C. Einspruch, Michael E. Gallagher, Carol R. Goldberg, Richard M. Mastaler and Richard W. Wright,
individually, and the Company, as a nominal defendant. The suit was filed in the Circuit Court for
Williamson County, Tennessee, seeking (i)&nbsp;money damages in the amount of $70&nbsp;million, (ii)
disgorgement by the individual defendants of all profits, special benefits and unjust enrichment,
(iii)&nbsp;actions to reform and improve its corporate governance and internal controls, (iv)&nbsp;punitive
damages, and (v)&nbsp;attorney&#146;s fees. Plaintiff alleged that the defendants acted in a grossly
negligent and reckless manner so as to cause the Company to violate the federal securities laws.
On July&nbsp;21, 2006, all parties to the action entered into a joint Stipulated Order of Dismissal to
dismiss the action in its entirety. This order was entered by the presiding judge on July&nbsp;27,
2006, and as such, this action has been dismissed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working capital amounts as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005, 2003 and 2002 include $10.0
million, $12.5&nbsp;million, $0.4&nbsp;million and $41.1&nbsp;million, respectively, of borrowings outstanding
under the Company&#146;s revolving credit facilities in place on those dates which were classified as
current liabilities in accordance with the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standard Board&#146;s
Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus 95-22, <I>Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding
Under Revolving Credit Agreements that Include Both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box
Arrangement </I>(&#147;EITF 95-22&#148;) as discussed below. The previous revolving credit facility had a
maturity date of October&nbsp;31, 2005; however, due to the presence of a typical material adverse
effect clause in the loan agreement combined with the existence of a mandatory lock-box agreement,
borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility have been classified as a current
liability in accordance with the guidance in EITF 95-22. On October&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company entered
into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement, which includes a revolving
credit facility and a maturity date of October&nbsp;31, 2008; however, due to a similar material adverse
effect clause combined with the existence of a mandatory lock-box agreement, borrowings outstanding
under the revolving credit facility are also classified as a current liability as of December&nbsp;31,
2006 and 2005. For further discussion, see &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; or Note 15 to the Company&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2007, the Company entered into a non-binding asset purchase proposal whereby
it intends to sell certain assets of SPP to Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corporation (&#147;Maxor&#148;).
The Company and Maxor are in the process of negotiating a definitive asset purchase agreement
providing for Maxor&#146;s purchase, at book value, of certain assets of SPP at closing, including certain
prepaid assets, inventory, information systems and other property and equipment. As part of the
proposed transaction, Maxor and PHS will enter into a long-term supply contract pursuant to which
Maxor will be the exclusive provider of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to PHS.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and Maxor are currently targeting the closing of this transaction effective March
31, 2007. The final execution of a definitive asset purchase agreement, long-term supply contract
and closing of the transaction is subject to final negotiations of the agreements, completion of
due diligence and final approval of the respective companies&#146; boards of directors, among other
things.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts
with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing arrangements, such as stop-loss
provisions and aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical costs. Such contracts typically
have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and generally may be terminated
by either party without cause upon proper notice. Revenues earned under contracts with
correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered. Cash received in
advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the
service is performed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee. For fixed fee contracts,
revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service contract
irrespective of inmate population. Revenues for population-based contracts are calculated either
on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for variances in the inmate
population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate multiplied by the average
inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee contracts, revenues are
calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual fee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a portion of the
Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in the majority
of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses, stop-loss provisions,
cost plus a fee arrangement or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of certain or all off-site
service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts.
Typically under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue under the contract increases
to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site expenses or pharmaceutical costs.
For contracts which include such provisions, the Company recognizes the additional revenues that
would be due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract to date costs incurred as
compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs. Because such provisions
typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and require all such additional
revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the additional revenues are initially
recorded as unbilled receivables until the time period for billing has been met and actual costs
are known. Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates of incurred costs and the actual costs
are recorded in the period in which such differences become known along with the corresponding
adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related
criteria. If necessary, the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods
when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon
delivery of the related products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and other healthcare
professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing and/or
administering the managed care including the costs associated with services provided and/or
administered by off-site medical providers, the costs of professional and general liability
insurance and other self-funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below. The cost of
healthcare services provided, administered or contracted for are recognized in the period in which
they are provided and/or administered based in part on estimates, including an accrual for
estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date. The Company
estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization data including
hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and
their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the average historical cost of such services.
An actuarial analysis is also prepared at least quarterly by an independent actuary to evaluate the
adequacy of the Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims payment
history. The analysis takes into account historical claims experience (including the average
historical costs and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial data. Additionally,
the Company&#146;s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient hospital stays
in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the historical average rates.
Once identified, reserves for such stays are determined which take into consideration the specific
facts of the stay.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the
healthcare cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of
claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual
claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are
made. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded decreases of
approximately $1.8&nbsp;million, $2.2
million and $1.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims liabilities as a result of
differences between actual and estimated claims experience.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, reserves have been recorded for the Company&#146;s self-insurance retention for
certain reported as well as unreported professional and general liability claims associated with the
delivery of medical services and included in accrued expenses and noncurrent portion of accrued
expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss
has been incurred (i.e., expected future healthcare costs and maintenance costs will exceed
anticipated future revenue) and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company
performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. The Company recognizes
allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors, including the length of time
receivables are past due, significant one-time events, contractual
rights, client funding and/or political pressures, discussions with clients and historical
experience. If circumstances change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be
further adjusted and such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results
of operations in the period in which they are recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbilled accounts receivable generally represent additional revenue earned under shared-risk
contracting models that remain unbilled at each balance sheet date, due to provisions within the
contracts governing the timing for billing such amounts.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s more significantly aged
receivable balances, net of reserves, are discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in September&nbsp;2005, management made a decision to temporarily suspend billings to SPP
customers until certain findings of the Audit Committee&#146;s internal investigation into matters at
SPP had been reviewed by the Company. Primarily as a result of this decision, SPP had
approximately $7.0&nbsp;million in unbilled receivables at December&nbsp;31, 2005. In February of 2006, SPP
submitted invoices to its customers for these amounts. As of February&nbsp;28, 2007, less than $0.1
million of these receivables remain outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to PHS accounts receivable, at December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had approximately
$1.7&nbsp;million of billed receivables due from clients whose contracts terminated prior to January&nbsp;1,
2006. Approximately $0.3&nbsp;million of this amount is due from clients whose contracts expired prior
to January&nbsp;1, 2005. In addition to the billed receivables due from these former clients, the
Company also has approximately $0.3&nbsp;million of unbilled receivables related to these former clients
which represent aggregate risk sharing receivable amounts which remain unbillable at December&nbsp;31,
2006 based on stated contract terms. This unbilled receivable amount relates to one client whose
contract expired prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005. The Company believes that these receivables are
contractually due under the terms of the respective expired contracts and therefore has recorded no
additional reserves related to these amounts. However, due to the age of the receivables and the
lack of an ongoing business relationship between the Company and the clients, there is a heightened
risk of uncollectibility related to these receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its clients will, from time to time, have disputes over amounts billed under
the Company&#146;s contracts. The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts in circumstances
where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company
is involved in a dispute with a current client where the client has withheld approximately $1.8
million from payments of receivables due the Company. The Company has recorded approximately $1.2
million of contractual allowances related to this matter which it estimates as the amount due to
the client for the period in question related to staffing penalties under the contract.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company is involved in a dispute with another current client over
billed receivables totaling approximately $1.1&nbsp;million. The Company has recorded no reserves
related to this amount as it believes the risk of loss is not probable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHS is currently involved in three lawsuits with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland
(the &#147;County&#148;). As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, PHS has approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of receivables due
from this former client, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September
14, 2006. The County has refused to pay PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006,
PHS filed suit against the County in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking
collection of the outstanding receivable balances and damages for breach of contract, quantum
meruit and unjust enrichment. The Company believes, in the case of the lawsuit filed in October
2006 that it has a valid and meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the
outstanding receivables, which represent services performed under the relationship between the
parties, are probable of collection. In the case of the two declaratory judgment actions described
in Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;, the Company believes it has valid contractual and legal
arguments, however, an adverse result in either or both of these cases could have a negative impact
on the Company&#146;s ability to collect the outstanding receivable amount. For more information about
the Baltimore County contract, see Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3.
&#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in each of the cases above, the Company believes the recorded amounts represent
valid receivables which are contractually due from clients, and other than the recorded reserves,
expects full collection. However, due to the factors discussed above, there is a heightened risk
of uncollectibility related to each of these circumstances which may result in future losses in
excess of such reserves. Nevertheless, the Company intends to take all necessary and available
measures in order to collect these receivables.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in circumstances related to the matters discussed above, or any other receivables,
could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate of contractual
adjustments in future periods. Such change, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Loss Contracts</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for succeeding
periods. The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company performs
this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as
future contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs, projected future
stop-loss insurance recoveries and each contract&#146;s specific terms related to future revenue
increases as compared to increased healthcare costs. The projected future healthcare and
maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost
increases. These estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims
experience as previously noted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. </I>The Company&#146;s contract with
the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (&#147;Maryland DPS&#148;) historically
underperformed, fluctuating between minimal profitability, break even and losses. This contract
was entered into on July&nbsp;1, 2000 to provide comprehensive medical services to four regions of the
Maryland prison system. The initial term of the contract was for the three years ended June&nbsp;30,
2003, with the Maryland DPS having the ability to renew the contract for two additional one-year
terms. The second renewal term of the contract expired June&nbsp;30, 2005. Under the terms of the
contract, the Maryland DPS paid the Company a flat fee per month with certain limited cost-sharing
adjustments for staffing costs, primarily nurses, and the cost of medications related to certain
specific illnesses. The Company was fully at risk for increases in hospitalization and outpatient
costs under the terms of the contract with the Maryland DPS. The contract also contained
provisions that allowed the Maryland DPS to assess penalties if certain staffing or performance
criteria were not maintained. The flat fee paid to the Company was increased annually based on a
portion of the Consumer Price Index.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the flat fee nature of this contract, the Company&#146;s margin under the contract was
significantly impacted by changes in healthcare costs, utilization trends or inmate population.
The Company incurred losses under this contract in April&nbsp;2004 at a level slightly above
expectations. The losses under the contract increased significantly in May&nbsp;2004 to approximately
$1.1&nbsp;million for the month. The primary cause for the increased loss was an unanticipated increase
in hospitalization costs beginning in May&nbsp;2004, resulting from the volume and acuity of services
being provided, the number of HIV and mental health patients and the costs associated with current
treatment guidelines. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss
contract charge of $6.8&nbsp;million, effective June&nbsp;1, 2004, which represented its &#147;most likely&#148;
estimate, at that date, of the future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland
DPS contract through its expiration on June&nbsp;30, 2005. This increase in the reserve for loss
contracts is reflected as a component of income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of tax, in
the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. This estimate assumed monthly losses under
the contract would diminish from the May&nbsp;2004 level, which was viewed as an aberration, to
approximately $0.5&nbsp;million per month, including allocated overhead, an amount significantly above
recent historical levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2004, the Company utilized $2.6&nbsp;million of its loss contract
reserve, almost entirely due to the underperformance of the Maryland DPS contract. While actual
monthly losses incurred under the Maryland DPS contract had trended downward from the record loss
in May&nbsp;2004, losses once again increased in September&nbsp;2004, driven primarily by off-site medical
costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off-site medical costs under the Maryland DPS contract averaged $1.3&nbsp;million per month for
June through September&nbsp;2004, as compared with initial estimates of $1.0&nbsp;million per month, based on
historical results. As a result of this new and more severe trend, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $6.0&nbsp;million, effective September&nbsp;30, 2004, to increase its reserve for estimated future
losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland DPS contract until its expiration on
June&nbsp;2005. This increase to the loss contract reserve is reflected as a component of income (loss)
from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations.
A fundamental assumption of the $6.0&nbsp;million increase in loss reserve was that the contract would
continue to incur on average $1.4&nbsp;million per month of off-site medical costs through its
termination on June&nbsp;30, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through April&nbsp;2005, actual losses incurred under the contract approximated the estimated
amounts. In May&nbsp;2005, off-site medical costs incurred under the Maryland DPS contract increased to
$1.8&nbsp;million, a level significantly above previous experience. These increased costs continued in
June&nbsp;2005 resulting in the Company recording an additional $1.3&nbsp;million increase to its reserve for
loss contracts. This pre-tax loss contract charge of $1.3&nbsp;million is reflected as a component of
income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of
operations. On June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company&#146;s contract with the Maryland DPS expired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company no longer has a loss contract reserve.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Baltimore County. </I>In addition to the Maryland DPS contract, the Company was
previously carrying a loss contract reserve for a contract to provide services to a county jail in
Baltimore County, Maryland. The Company contends that the original term of this contract expired
on June&nbsp;30, 2005, without Baltimore County (the &#147;County&#148;) exercising the first of three, two-year
renewal options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, the Company sent a letter to the County stating its position
that the Company&#146;s contract to provide services expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s
failure to provide such extension notice. The County is disputing the Company&#146;s contention and has
asserted that it properly exercised the first renewal option and that the term of the contract
therefore was through June&nbsp;30, 2007, with extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In 2005, the
County and PHS agreed to have a judicial authority interpret the contract through formal judicial
proceedings, and, at the County&#146;s request, PHS continued to provide healthcare services to the
County pending the judicial resolution of the dispute, while reserving all of its rights. Finally,
during September&nbsp;2006, amid reciprocal claims of default, both the Company and the County took individual steps to terminate the
relationship between (or the contract, if it is ultimately determined to be in effect by the appellate court
in the proceeding discussed above) the parties. PHS contends that it terminated the relationship
effective September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to various breaches by the County.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the
County ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two year renewal option by sending a
faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed this ruling. On December&nbsp;6,
2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County
did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the
case to the district court to determine whether the County properly exercised the option by its
conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally decided by the trial court. PHS plans to
vigorously pursue its case with respect to this issue and feels that it has
valid arguments in its favor. However, in the event PHS is not
ultimately successful and the court determines that the contract was renewed due to the conduct of the County prior
to June&nbsp;30, 2005, such an adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect on the other two
suits between the County and PHS (which were discussed previously) and therefore on the Company&#146;s
financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For

Proceedings.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might identify
additional contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances.
Circumstances that might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract
in a future period include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions,
unanticipated adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the
utilization of outside medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by
increased healthcare revenues. Should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future
period, the Company would record, in the period in which such identification is made, a reserve for
the estimated future losses that would be incurred under the contract. The identification of a
loss contract in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of
operations in the period in which the reserve is recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Professional and General Liability Self-Insurance Retention</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company&#146;s business ordinarily results in actions for negligence
and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the attendant risk
of substantial damage awards, or court ordered non-monetary relief such as, changes in operating
practices or procedures, which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in the Company&#146;s
operating expenses. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk
of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services or the lack of timely adequate
healthcare services. The Company may also be liable, as employer, for the negligence of healthcare
professionals it employs or healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The Company&#146;s
contracts generally provide for the Company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses
incurred related to healthcare provided by the Company and its agents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains a primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. However, the Company is effectively
self-insured resulting from the use of adjustable
premium policies in 2002 through 2006. For 2002 and 2003, the Company is covered by
separate policies each of which contains a retro-premium with adjustment based on actual losses
after a minimum of 42&nbsp;months. For 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company is covered by separate policies
each of which contains a retro-premium with adjustment based on

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">actual
losses after a minimum of 30&nbsp;months. The Company&#146;s ultimate
premium for its 2002 through 2006 policies will depend on the final incurred losses related to each of
these separate policy periods. Management establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will
be incurred under these insurance policies after taking into consideration internal and external
counsel evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis
of claim history, the
estimated reserves recommended by the Company&#146;s third-party
administrator and independent actuarial analysis. Any adjustments
resulting from the review are reflected in current earnings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence, in addition to
its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported
claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by an independent actuarial analysis, which
is obtained on a quarterly basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company&#146;s reserves for both known and incurred but not reported claims
totaled $23.5&nbsp;million. Reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number of
claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next.
Furthermore, payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the
estimated liability. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and
differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to
the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which the estimates are changed or
payments are made. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded increases of approximately $4.2
million, $4.3&nbsp;million and $4.7&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims reserves as a result
of adverse development. The reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of
the third-party insurance carriers used by the Company. If a third party insurance carrier fails
to meet its contractual obligations under the agreement with the Company, the Company would then be
responsible for such obligations. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s results of operations in the period in which the changes occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Self-Funded Insurance Reserves</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has approximately $7.9&nbsp;million in accrued liabilities for
employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims. Approximately
$6.4 million of this amount is related to workers&#146; compensation
claims, of which approximately $3.5&nbsp;million is included within the noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is
not expected to be paid within a year. The Company is essentially self-insured for employee health
and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain individual case stop loss levels. As such, its
insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and the ability to control claims. The
Company accrues the estimated liability for employee health insurance based on its history of
claims experience and estimated time lag between the incident date and the date of actual claim
payment. The Company accrues the estimated liability for workers&#146; compensation claims based on
internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis of claims
history and the estimated reserves assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator. On a
periodic basis, the Company obtains an independent actuarial analysis to further support the
appropriateness of the workers&#146; compensation reserve. These estimates of self-funded insurance
reserves could change in the future based on changes in the factors discussed above. Any
adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are reflected in current earnings. In 2006,
2005 and 2004, the Company recorded an increase of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, a decrease of
approximately $1.4&nbsp;million and an increase of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to its
prior year other self-insurance reserves as a result of differences between actual and estimated
claims experience.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to professional and general liability claims, the Company is also subject to other
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such proceedings generally relate to labor,
employment or contract matters. When estimable, the Company accrues an estimate of the probable
costs for the resolution of these claims. Such estimates are developed in consultation with outside
counsel handling the Company&#146;s defense in these matters and are based upon an estimated range of
potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. The Company
does not believe any of the current proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position. However, it is possible that future results of operations for any
particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions, new
developments or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with such
litigation. See discussion of certain outstanding legal matters in

Based on the results of this annual review, management has determined that goodwill related to its
pharmaceutical distribution services segment is impaired as of December&nbsp;31, 2006. Accordingly, the
Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3.0&nbsp;million during the fourth quarter of 2006.
No other indication of goodwill impairment was identified. However, future events could cause the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired based upon the
existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment or as a result of its annual
impairment review, any impairment is measured using a fair-value-based goodwill impairment test as
required under the provisions of SFAS 142. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be
bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number
of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value
techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenues. The fair value
of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation
techniques.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company determines that the carrying value of other intangible assets may not be
recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, any
impairment is measured using an estimate of the asset&#146;s fair value based on the projected net cash
flows expected to result from that asset, including eventual disposition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles on at
least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and circumstances, including its retention
rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and circumstances indicate the current estimated life
is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the estimated useful life on a prospective basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;109&#148;). Under the asset and liability method of SFAS
No.&nbsp;109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; It further states &#147;forming a conclusion that a
valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative
losses in recent years.&#148; From December&nbsp;31, 2001 to June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company maintained a
100% valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets
that can be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the Company&#146;s results of operations since December&nbsp;31, 2001, and its expected
profitability in future years, the Company concluded, effective June&nbsp;30, 2004, that it is more
likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets will be realized. As a
result, in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to
such net deferred tax assets was reversed in the second quarter of 2004. Reversal of the valuation
allowance resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit in the second
quarter of 2004 totaling $6.6
million. This benefit represented the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax assets,
excluding those deferred tax assets that resulted from the exercise of employee stock options. The
reversal of the valuation allowance that related to the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax
assets resulting from the exercises of employee stock options totaled $3.9&nbsp;million and was recorded
as a direct increase to additional paid-in capital in the stockholders&#146; equity portion of the
Company&#146;s balance sheet as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. At December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, the Company&#146;s
valuation allowance of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million and $0.3&nbsp;million, respectively, represents
management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss carryforwards which will expire unused.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that
the Company&#146;s tax return positions are fully supported, the Company believes that certain positions
will be challenged and a risk exists that the Company&#146;s positions will not be fully sustained. The
tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of

are recorded in the period in which the new facts or circumstances become known, therefore the
accruals are subject to change in future periods and such change, if it were to occur, could have a

tax contingency accruals are reflected as a component of accrued liabilities.

transition method. Under the modified prospective transition method, recognized compensation cost
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 includes (i)&nbsp;compensation cost for all share-based payments
granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January&nbsp;1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123; and (ii)&nbsp;compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted on or after January&nbsp;1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective method,
the Company has not restated prior period results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company recognized total share-based compensation
cost of $4.3&nbsp;million which consisted of $0.4&nbsp;million classified in healthcare expenses and $3.9
million classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. These amounts include restricted stock share-based compensation that was
already being reflected in net income prior to the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R). For the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company also recognized a total income tax benefit in the consolidated
statements of operations for share-based compensation arrangements of $1.5&nbsp;million. The Company
did not capitalize any share-based compensation cost.

adopting SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) by amounts totaling $4.2&nbsp;million, $2.7&nbsp;million and $2.7&nbsp;million,
respectively. The effect of adopting SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) on basic and diluted earnings per common

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Note 7 of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, the Company is applying
the discontinued operations provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;), to all correctional healthcare service contracts that expire subsequent to
January&nbsp;1, 2002. SFAS No.&nbsp;144 requires the Company to follow the income statement presentation
format described in SFAS No.&nbsp;144. The results of operations of contracts that expire, less
applicable income taxes, are classified on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations
separately from continuing operations. The presentation prescribed for discontinued operations
requires the collapsing of healthcare revenues and expenses, as well as other specifically
identifiable costs, into the income or loss from discontinued operations. Items such as indirect
selling, general and administrative expenses or interest expense cannot be allocated to expired
contracts. The application of the SFAS No.&nbsp;144 accounting presentation to expired contracts has no
impact on net income, earnings per share, total cash flows or stockholders&#146; equity. As a result of
the application of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;healthcare revenues&#148; and &#147;healthcare expenses&#148; on the Company&#146;s
consolidated statements of operations for any period presented will only include revenues and
expenses from continuing contracts.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare revenues. </I>Healthcare revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 increased $29.9
million, or 5.5%, from $539.5&nbsp;million in 2005 to $569.4&nbsp;million in 2006. Healthcare revenues in
2006 included $35.3&nbsp;million of revenue growth resulting from new correctional healthcare services
contracts added in 2006 and 2005 through marketing activities. Correctional healthcare services
contracts in place at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and in continuing operations at December&nbsp;31, 2006,
experienced revenue growth of 2.6% consisting of an increase in revenue of $12.2&nbsp;million during
2006 as the result of contract renegotiations and automatic price adjustments. Offsetting these
revenue increases, SPP pharmaceutical distribution revenue decreased $17.6&nbsp;million primarily due to
the loss of two distribution customers in 2005 and one distribution customer in June&nbsp;2006. As
discussed in the discontinued operations section below, all healthcare services contracts that have
expired or otherwise been terminated subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2002 have been classified as
discontinued operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare expenses. </I>Healthcare expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 increased $23.8
million, or 4.7%, from $506.4&nbsp;million in 2005 to $530.2&nbsp;million in 2006. Included in the
healthcare expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 is approximately $0.4&nbsp;million related to
share-based compensation expense. No such share-based compensation was recorded in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005. Expenses related to new correctional healthcare services contracts
added in 2005 and 2006 through marketing activities accounted for $33.6&nbsp;million of the increase.
Correctional healthcare services contracts in place at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and in continuing
operations at December&nbsp;31, 2006 accounted for $4.4&nbsp;million of the increase as a result of increases
in the levels of staff and staff compensation and increases in the outpatient services and pharmacy
costs associated with providing healthcare to inmates at existing contracts. Offsetting these
healthcare expense increases, SPP pharmaceutical distribution expense decreased $14.6&nbsp;million
primarily as a result of the decrease in SPP pharmaceutical distribution revenue discussed above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selling, general and administrative expenses. </I>Selling, general and administrative expenses
for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2006 increased $6.9&nbsp;million from $18.1&nbsp;million, or 3.4% of
revenue, in 2005 to $25.0&nbsp;million, or 4.4% of revenue, in 2006. Included in the selling, general
and administrative expenses for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2006 and 2005 is approximately $3.9
million and $0.1&nbsp;million, respectively, related to share-based compensation expense. The
share-based compensation expense recorded in 2005 was related to restricted stock granted to
directors in 2004 and 2005. The increase in share-based compensation is due to the adoption of
SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) effective January&nbsp;1, 2006. The remaining increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2005 was primarily the result of salary increases as the Company developed its operational team and
consulting expense related to management and director searches and SPP efficiency
improvements. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company no longer has contracts classified as
loss contracts, therefore there were no overhead costs associated with the Company&#146;s loss
contracts charged against the loss contract reserve during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.
Approximately $0.6&nbsp;million in overhead costs associated with the Company&#146;s loss contracts were
charged against the loss contract reserve during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Audit Committee investigation and related expenses. </I>Audit Committee investigation and related
expenses were $5.3&nbsp;million, or 1.0% of healthcare revenues, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 as
compared to $3.7&nbsp;million, or 0.7% of healthcare revenues, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005.
The Audit Committee investigation and related expenses incurred in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006
and 2005 related to an internal investigation conducted by the Audit Committee primarily to
determine whether SPP provided pricing of pharmaceuticals in accordance with applicable contract
terms and whether some of the accruals and reserves maintained by SPP were established and utilized
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Impairment of goodwill. </I>For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company recorded a
non-cash impairment charge totaling $3.0&nbsp;million, or 0.5% of healthcare revenues related to its
pharmaceutical distribution services segment. The charge was recorded
to write off the carrying
value of goodwill based on the Company&#146;s annual impairment analysis as
required by SFAS No.&nbsp;142.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Depreciation and amortization. </I>Depreciation and amortization expense for each of the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005 was $4.1&nbsp;million and $4.0&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Discontinued acquisition expenses. </I>There were no discontinued
acquisition expenses incurred in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. Discontinued acquisition expenses were $0.7&nbsp;million, or
0.1% of healthcare revenues, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. The discontinued acquisition
expenses incurred in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 related to a potential acquisition of a
healthcare company outside of the corrections sector. These acquisition discussions were
discontinued in late July&nbsp;2005.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest, net. </I>Net interest expense increased to $1.9&nbsp;million, or 0.3% of revenue in 2006,
from $1.2&nbsp;million, or 0.2% of revenue in 2005, as a result of an increase in average borrowings
outstanding and an increase in the prevailing interest rates during
2006. Such increase in borrowings is related to the Company&#146;s minimum outstanding
borrowings requirement under the terms of its Credit Agreement.

as compared with income from discontinued operations, net of taxes of $1.2&nbsp;million, or 0.2% of
revenue, in 2005. Income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of taxes represents the
operating results of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services contracts that have expired or
otherwise been terminated. The classification of these expired contracts is the result of the
Company&#146;s adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 effective January&nbsp;1, 2002. See Note 7 of the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of SFAS No.&nbsp;144. Approximately $6.7
million in negative operating margin related to the Company&#146;s loss contracts classified as
discontinued operations was charged against the loss contract reserve during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005. There was no negative operating margin related to the Company&#146;s loss contracts

million, or 8.9%, from $495.5&nbsp;million in 2004 to $539.5&nbsp;million in 2005. Healthcare revenues in
2005 included $27.1&nbsp;million of revenue growth resulting from new correctional healthcare services
contracts added in 2005 and 2004. Correctional healthcare services contracts in place at December
31, 2003 and in continuing operations at December&nbsp;31, 2006, experienced revenue growth of 5.4%
consisting of an increase in revenue of $24.4&nbsp;million during 2005 as the result of contract
renegotiations and automatic price adjustments. Offsetting these revenue increases, SPP
pharmaceutical distribution revenue decreased $7.5&nbsp;million primarily as a result of the loss of two
distribution customers in 2005. As discussed in the discontinued operations section below, all
healthcare services contracts that have expired or otherwise been terminated subsequent to January
1, 2002 have been classified as discontinued operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare expenses. </I>Healthcare expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 increased $53.8

at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and in continuing operations at December&nbsp;31, 2006 accounted for $31.2&nbsp;million
of the increase as a result of increases in the levels of staff and staff compensation, increases
in off-site utilization, increases in the outpatient services and pharmacy costs associated with
providing healthcare to inmates at existing contracts and increases in medical malpractice
expenses. Offsetting these healthcare expense increases, SPP pharmaceutical distribution expense
decreased $3.4&nbsp;million which was primarily due to the decline in volume discussed above.

Limited Partnership, entered into a settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office
on March&nbsp;30, 2004, related to allegations, first raised in connection with an investigation of EMSA
Correctional Services (&#147;EMSA&#148;) in 1997, that the Company may have played an indirect role in the
improper billing of Medicaid by independent providers treating incarcerated patients. The Company
acquired EMSA in 1999. EMSA was a party to several contracts to provide healthcare to inmates at
Florida correctional facilities. Typically, in those contracts, which were approved by government
lawyers, the clients required EMSA to seek all available third party reimbursement for medical
services provided and/or administered to inmates, specifically including Medicaid. It was the
implementation of these contract requirements that the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office alleged
was improper.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office constitutes a complete
resolution and settlement of the claims asserted against EMSA and required EMSA Limited Partnership
to pay $5.0&nbsp;million to the State of Florida. This payment was made by the Company on March&nbsp;30,
2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company and all of its subsidiaries are
released from liability for any alleged actions which might have occurred from December&nbsp;1, 1998 to
March&nbsp;31, 2004. Both parties entered into the settlement agreement to avoid the delay,
uncertainty, inconvenience and expense of protracted litigation. The settlement agreement states
that it is not punitive in purpose or effect, it should not be construed or used as admission of
any fault, wrongdoing or liability whatsoever, and that EMSA specifically denies intentionally
submitting any medical claims in violation of state or federal law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recorded a charge of $5.2&nbsp;million in its results of operations for the first
quarter of 2004, reflecting the settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office and
related legal expenses.

$1.9&nbsp;million or 0.4% of revenue in 2004 primarily as a result of a reduction in average borrowings
outstanding.

There was no late fee income received in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. The late fee income
received in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 was related to past due accounts receivable balances
due from a client.

was $2.5&nbsp;million, or 0.5% of revenue, as compared with an income tax benefit of $3.4&nbsp;million or
0.7% of revenue in 2004. During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company recorded an income
tax benefit of $6.6&nbsp;million which resulted from the reversal, effective June&nbsp;30, 2004, of
substantially all of the valuation allowance previously established for its net deferred tax
assets. This credit was partially offset by a tax provision recorded for the last six months of
2004 and recognition of a tax contingency reserve of approximately $0.5&nbsp;million. Prior to June&nbsp;30,
2004, the Company maintained a 100% valuation allowance, established in the quarter ended December
31, 2001, related to its net deferred tax assets.

as compared with a loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2004 of $8.0&nbsp;million, or 1.6% of revenue. Income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of taxes
represents the operating results of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services contracts that
have expired or otherwise been terminated. The classification of these expired contracts is the
result of the Company&#146;s adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 effective January&nbsp;1, 2002. See Note 7 of the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of SFAS No.&nbsp;144. Approximately
$6.7&nbsp;million in negative operating margin related to the Company&#146;s loss contracts
classified as discontinued operations was charged against the loss
contract reserve during each of the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004. Approximately $0.1&nbsp;million of this amount
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 related to the Company&#146;s contract to provide services to a
county jail in Baltimore County, Maryland. For more information about the Baltimore County
contract, see Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148;

(&#147;Maryland DPS&#148;) historically underperformed, fluctuating between minimal profitability, break even
and losses. This contract was entered into on July&nbsp;1, 2000 to provide comprehensive medical
services to four regions of the Maryland prison system. The initial term of the contract was for
the three years ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, with the Maryland DPS having the ability to renew the contract
for two additional one-year terms. The second renewal term of the contract expired June&nbsp;30, 2005.
Under the terms of the contract, the Maryland DPS paid the Company a flat fee per month with
certain limited cost-sharing adjustments for staffing costs, primarily nurses, and the cost of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">medications related to certain specific illnesses. The Company was fully at risk for
increases in hospitalization and outpatient costs under the terms of the contract with the Maryland
DPS. The contract also contained provisions that allowed the Maryland DPS to assess penalties if
certain staffing or performance criteria were not maintained. The flat fee paid to the Company was
increased annually based on a portion of the Consumer Price Index.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the flat fee nature of this contract, the Company&#146;s margin under the contract was
significantly impacted by changes in healthcare costs, utilization trends or inmate population.
The Company incurred losses under this contract in April&nbsp;2004 at a level slightly above
expectations. The losses under the contract increased significantly in May&nbsp;2004 to approximately
$1.1&nbsp;million for the month. The primary cause for the increased loss was an unanticipated increase
in hospitalization costs beginning in May&nbsp;2004, resulting from the volume and acuity of services
being provided, the number of HIV and mental health patients and the costs associated with current
treatment guidelines. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss
contract charge of $6.8&nbsp;million, effective June&nbsp;1, 2004, which represented its &#147;most likely&#148;
estimate, at that date, of the future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland
DPS contract through its expiration on June&nbsp;30, 2005. This increase in the reserve for loss
contracts is reflected as a component of income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of tax, in
the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2004. This estimate assumed monthly losses under
the contract would diminish from the May&nbsp;2004 level, which was viewed as an aberration, to
approximately $0.5&nbsp;million per month, including allocated overhead, an amount significantly above
recent historical levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2004, the Company utilized $2.6&nbsp;million of its loss contract
reserve, almost entirely due to the underperformance of the Maryland DPS contract. While actual
monthly losses incurred under the Maryland DPS contract had trended downward from the record loss
in May&nbsp;2004, losses once again increased in September&nbsp;2004, driven primarily by off-site medical
costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off-site medical costs under the Maryland DPS contract averaged $1.3&nbsp;million per month for
June through September&nbsp;2004, as compared with initial estimates of $1.0&nbsp;million per month, based on
historical results. As a result of this new and more severe trend, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $6.0&nbsp;million, effective September&nbsp;30, 2004, to increase its reserve for estimated future
losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland DPS contract until its expiration on
June&nbsp;2005. This increase in the reserve for loss contracts is reflected as a component of income
(loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of
operations for the year
ended December 31, 2004. A fundamental assumption of the $6.0&nbsp;million increase in loss reserve was that the
contract would continue to incur on average $1.4&nbsp;million per month of off-site medical costs
through its termination on June&nbsp;30, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through April&nbsp;2005, actual losses incurred under the contract approximated the estimated
amounts. In May&nbsp;2005, off-site medical costs incurred under the Maryland DPS contract increased to
$1.8&nbsp;million, a level significantly above previous experience. These increased costs continued in
June&nbsp;2005 resulting in the Company recording an additional $1.3&nbsp;million increase to its reserve for
loss contracts. This pre-tax loss contract charge of $1.3&nbsp;million is reflected as a component of
income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of
operations for the year
ended December 31, 2005.

factors discussed above.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company had working capital of $6.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 compared to $4.4&nbsp;million
at December&nbsp;31, 2005. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 46 at December&nbsp;31, 2006
while accounts payable days outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2006 were 34 and medical claims liability
days outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2006 were 88. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were
61 at December&nbsp;31, 2005 while accounts payable days outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2005 were 49 and
medical claims liability days outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2005 were 105. The decrease of 15&nbsp;days
sales outstanding from December&nbsp;31, 2005 to December&nbsp;31,
2006 was primarily due to collections of accounts receivable which
were past due and a decrease in unbilled receivables, primarily
related to SPP. The timing of the Company&#146;s collection of
accounts receivable, if delayed, could have a material adverse effect
on the Company&#146;s cash flows from operations, days sales
outstanding and cash and debt levels outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company had a net loss of $3.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 compared to
net income of $4.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. The Company had stockholders&#146;
equity of $46.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 as compared to $56.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005.
The Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalents increased to $13.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006. The
Company had no cash and cash equivalents at December&nbsp;31, 2005. The Company had restricted cash of
$4.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005 used to collateralize outstanding letters of credit. The overall
increase in cash and cash equivalents combined was primarily the result of cash flow provided by
operations. The Company&#146;s outstanding balance on its credit
facility was $10.0&nbsp;million at December
31, 2006 compared to $12.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005.

as compared with cash flows used in operating activities of $10.6&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005. The increase in cash flows from operating activities of $35.9&nbsp;million was
primarily due to a reduction in outstanding accounts receivable resulting from collections of past

net payments on the line of credit and share repurchases. Cash flows provided by financing

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and
Security Agreement with CapitalSource Finance, LLC (&#147;Lender&#148;) which was subsequently amended on
March&nbsp;14, 2006 and on October&nbsp;31, 2006 (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) to amend debt covenant requirements
with which the Company would not have been in compliance. The Credit Agreement matures on October
31, 2008 and includes a $50.0&nbsp;million revolving credit facility under which the Company may have
standby letters of credit issued in amounts up to $15.0&nbsp;million. The amount available to the
Company for borrowings under the Credit Agreement is reduced by the amount of each outstanding
standby letter of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all assets of the
Company and its operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Agreement totaling $10.0&nbsp;million and $16.2&nbsp;million available for
additional borrowing, based on the Company&#146;s collateral base on that date, less a reserve against
availability pending the Lenders&#146; review of the outcome of the Audit Committee&#146;s internal
investigation into matters at SPP of $5.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006, and outstanding standby
letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to maintain a minimum
outstanding borrowings balance (the &#147;Minimum Borrowing Balance&#148;) of $10.0&nbsp;million to October&nbsp;31,
2007 and $7.5&nbsp;million from October&nbsp;31, 2007 to October&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of eligible
receivables less a reserve against availability pending the Lenders&#146; review of the outcome of the
Company&#146;s internal investigation into matters at SPP (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (2)
$50.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;Borrowing Capacity&#148;). Interest under the Credit Agreement is payable monthly
at an annual rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.75% if the Company&#146;s trailing twelve month EBITDA is
less than $40.0&nbsp;million or 2.25% if the Company&#146;s trailing twelve month EBITDA is greater than
$40.0&nbsp;million. The Company&#146;s interest rate at December&nbsp;31, 2006 was 8.1%. The Company is also
required to pay a monthly collateral management fee equal to 0.0625% on average borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a monthly unused line
fee equal to a monthly rate of 0.0375% on the Borrowing Capacity less the actual average borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Agreement for the month, the reserve against availability pending
the Lenders&#146; review of the outcome of the Company&#146;s internal investigation into matters at SPP and
the balance of any outstanding letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will be due and payable on October&nbsp;31, 2008.
If the Credit Agreement is extinguished prior to August&nbsp;1, 2008, the Company will be required to
pay an early termination fee equal to between 1.5% and 2.5% of the Borrowing Capacity depending on
the date extinguished. The Credit Agreement requires a lockbox agreement which provides for all
receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. This agreement, combined with the
existence of a Material Adverse Effect (&#147;MAE&#148;) clause in the Credit Agreement, requires the
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement to be classified as a current liability, in
accordance with EITF Issue No.&nbsp;95-22, <I>Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under
Revolving Credit Agreements that Include Both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box
Arrangement</I>. The MAE clause, which is a common requirement in commercial credit agreements, allows
the Lender to require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s operations, business, properties, assets, liabilities, condition or
prospects. The classification of the Credit Agreement as a current liability is a result only of
the combination of the two aforementioned factors: the mandatory lockbox agreements and the MAE
clause. The Credit Agreement does not expire or have a maturity date within one year. As discussed
above, the Credit Agreement has a final expiration date of October&nbsp;31, 2008.

ratio of 1.75 on a trailing twelve-month basis to be measured at the end of each calendar quarter.
The Credit Agreement defines the fixed charge coverage ratio as
EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, divided
by the sum of principal payments on outstanding debt, cash interest expense on outstanding debt,

As discussed further above, although the Company&#146;s revolving credit facility does not
contractually mature until October&nbsp;31, 2008, it is classified as a current liability under the
guidance of EITF Issue No.&nbsp;95-22. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company was contingently liable for
$12.0&nbsp;million of performance bonds. The performance bonds are collateralized by standby letters of
credit totaling $5.0&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Company&#146;s contracts provide for annual increases in the base fixed fee based upon
changes in the regional medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. In all other contracts
that extend beyond one year, the Company utilizes a projection of the future inflation rate of its
cost of services when bidding and negotiating the fixed fee for future years. If the rate of
inflation exceeds the levels projected, the excess costs will be absorbed by the Company with the
financial impact dependent upon contract structure. Conversely, the Company may benefit should the
actual rate of inflation fall below the estimate used in the bidding and negotiation process.

interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109 </I>(&#147;FIN 48&#148;). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement
No.&nbsp;109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes</I>, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle
recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting FIN 48.

extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to
measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. The standard applies

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial statements
of the Company due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. The Company&#146;s
exposure to market risk is primarily related to changes in the variable interest rate under the
Credit Agreement in 2006. The Credit Agreement carries an interest rate based on the one-month
LIBOR rate; therefore the Company&#146;s cash flow may be affected by changes in the one-month LIBOR
rate. A hypothetical 10% change in the underlying interest rate would have would have had no
material effect on interest expense paid under the Credit Agreement. Interest expense represents
0.3% and 0.2% of the Company&#146;s revenues, respectively, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and
2005. The Company&#146;s total debt outstanding of $10.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 represents 5.4%
of the Company&#146;s total liabilities and stockholders&#146; equity.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure controls and procedures are the Company&#146;s controls and other procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported in a complete, accurate and appropriate manner, within the time
periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company evaluated under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures,
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;13a-15 and Rule&nbsp;15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information that is required to be
included in the Company&#146;s periodic SEC filings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules&nbsp;13a &#151; 15(f).
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;). Based on the
Company&#146;s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework, management
concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of December&nbsp;31, 2006 has been audited by Ernst &#038; Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page
39.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Remediation of Material Weaknesses</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies,
that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In performing the annual assessment as of
December&nbsp;31, 2005, management identified the following control deficiencies that the Company
concluded were material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31,
2005:

on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Board of Directors and Stockholders of America Service Group Inc.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited management&#146;s assessment, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that America Service Group Inc. (the
&#147;Company&#148;) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the &#147;COSO criteria&#148;). The Company&#146;s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management&#146;s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, management&#146;s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, based on the COSO
criteria<B>.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of America Service Group Inc. as
of December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146;
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and our
report dated March&nbsp;2, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America Service Group Inc. (the
&#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31,
2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule referenced at Item&nbsp;15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of America Service Group Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2006
and 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for share-based payments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004) on January&nbsp;1, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting
as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
March&nbsp;2, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>1. Description of Business</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America Service Group Inc. (&#147;ASG&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) and its consolidated subsidiaries provide
managed healthcare services to correctional facilities under contracts with state and local
governments and certain private entities. The health status of inmates impacts the results of
operations under such contractual arrangements. In addition to providing managed healthcare
services, the Company also provides pharmaceutical distribution services through one of its
operating subsidiaries, Secure Pharmacy Plus, LLC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Principles of Consolidation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, Prison Health Services, Inc. (&#147;PHS&#148;), EMSA Limited Partnership, Correctional
Health Services, LLC (&#147;CHS&#148;) and Secure Pharmacy Plus, LLC (&#147;SPP&#148;). All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Use of Estimates</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the more significant areas requiring
estimates in the financial statements include the Company&#146;s estimate of refunds due to customers
as a result of the investigation performed by the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors (the
&#147;Audit Committee&#148;) into certain matters related to its subsidiary, SPP, accruals for unbilled
medical services calculated based upon a claims payment lag methodology, realization of goodwill,
reductions in revenue for contractual allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, loss contract
reserves, legal contingencies, employee health, workers&#146; compensation and professional and general
liability claims for which the Company is substantially self-insured and share-based compensation.
Estimates change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, or additional information is
obtained. A change in an estimate is accounted for in the period of change.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets consist of
cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities and revolving credit facility. Due to the short term nature of these instruments and
the variable interest rate nature of the revolving credit facility, the carrying amounts
approximate fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue and Cost Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts
with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing arrangements, such as stop-loss
provisions and aggregate limits for off-site or pharmaceutical costs. Such contracts typically
have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and generally may be terminated
by either party without cause upon proper notice. Revenues earned under contracts with
correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered. Cash received in
advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the
service is performed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three
general categories: fixed fee, population based, or cost plus a fee. For fixed fee contracts,
revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service contract
irrespective of inmate population. Revenues for population-based contracts are calculated either
on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for variances in the inmate
population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate multiplied by the average
inmate population for the period of service. For cost plus a fee contracts, revenues are
calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual fee.
</DIV>

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><!-- Folio -->F-7<!-- /Folio -->

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a portion of the
Company&#146;s risk related to cost increases. Off-site utilization risk is mitigated in the majority
of the Company&#146;s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off-site expenses, stop-loss provisions,
cost plus a fee arrangement or, in some cases, the entire exclusion of certain or all off-site
service costs. Pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the Company&#146;s contracts.
Typically under the terms of such provisions, the Company&#146;s revenue under the contract increases
to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off-site expenses or pharmaceutical costs.
For contracts which include such provisions, the Company recognizes the additional revenues that
would be due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract to date costs incurred as
compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs. Because such provisions
typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and require all such additional
revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses, the additional revenues are initially
recorded as unbilled receivables until the time period for billing has been met and actual costs
are known. Any differences between the Company&#146;s estimates of incurred costs and the actual costs
are recorded in the period in which such differences become known along with the corresponding
adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all contracts, the Company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances
for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related
criteria. If necessary, the Company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods
when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon
delivery of the related products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians, nurses and other healthcare
professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing and/or
administering the managed care including the costs associated with services provided and/or
administered by off-site medical providers, the costs of professional and general liability
insurance and other self-funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below. The cost of
healthcare services provided, administered or contracted for are recognized in the period in which
they are provided and/or administered based in part on estimates, including an accrual for
estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date. The Company
estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization data including
hospitalization, one-day surgeries, physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and
their corresponding costs, which are estimated using the average historical cost of such services.
An actuarial analysis is also prepared at least quarterly by an independent actuary to evaluate the
adequacy of the Company&#146;s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims payment
history. The analysis takes into account historical claims experience (including the average
historical costs and billing lag time for such services) and other actuarial data. Additionally,
the Company&#146;s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient hospital stays
in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the historical average rates.
Once identified, reserves for such stays are determined which take into consideration the specific
facts of the stay.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the Company&#146;s current
estimates. The differences could be material if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the
healthcare cost structure or the Company&#146;s future claims experience. Changes in estimates of
claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual
claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are
made. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded decreases of
approximately $1.8 million, $2.2
million and $1.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year claims liabilities as a result of
differences between actual and estimated claims experience.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, reserves have been recorded for the Company&#146;s self-insurance retention for
certain reported as well as unreported professional and general liability claims associated with the
delivery of medical services and included in accrued expenses and noncurrent portion of accrued
expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of its annual review at December&nbsp;31, 2006, management has determined
that goodwill related to its pharmaceutical distribution services segment is impaired.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3.0&nbsp;million during the fourth
quarter of 2006. See Note 4 for further information related to this impairment charge. No other
indication of goodwill impairment was identified. However, future events could cause the Company
to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the Company&#146;s goodwill related to its
correctional healthcare services segment is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a
material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Contracts and Other Intangibles</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its contract and other intangibles
when events and circumstances warrant, generally in conjunction with the annual business planning
cycle. If the carrying value of the evaluated asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized
based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value. Fair market value
is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company amortizes its contract intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life. Contract amortization expense totaled approximately $1.6&nbsp;million for each of the
three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The estimated useful life of the Company&#146;s
contract intangibles was determined by an independent appraisal at the time of the acquisition.
Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its
contract intangibles on at least a quarterly basis, taking into account new facts and
circumstances related to its retention rate for acquired contracts. If such facts and
circumstances indicate the current estimated life is no longer reasonable, the Company adjusts the
estimated useful life on a prospective basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other intangibles are comprised primarily of non-compete agreements. Amortization of
non-compete agreements is calculated over the term of the related agreements (2 to 10&nbsp;years) and
approximates $0.2&nbsp;million for each of the three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Assets</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005 include cash deposits totaling approximately $7.3
million and $9.8&nbsp;million, respectively, which are held by the Company&#146;s professional liability
insurer and workers compensation insurer and are not expected to be utilized within the next year.
In addition to cash deposits recorded within other assets, the Company has recorded cash
deposits for professional liability claims losses totaling $6.0&nbsp;million and $8.4&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, within prepaid expenses and other current assets, which
are expected to be utilized within a year. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s professional
liability insurance policies for 2002 through 2006, this cash will be used by the insurer
to pay any professional liability claims made against the Company during those years. For 2002
and 2003, the Company is covered by separate policies each of which contains a retro-premium with
adjustment based on actual losses after a minimum of 42&nbsp;months. For 2004, 2005 and 2006, the
Company is covered by separate policies each of which contains a retro-premium with adjustment
based on actual losses after a minimum of 30&nbsp;months. As discussed further in the Professional and
General Liability Insurance section of this Note and Note 22, management monitors the Company&#146;s
estimated exposure related to claims made under the policies using external and internal
evaluations of the merits of the individual claims, analysis of claim
history, the estimated
reserves assigned by the Company&#146;s third-party administrator and
independent actuarial analysis. Based on this information,
management estimates the amount of cash deposits that will be utilized by the insurer to pay
losses and the amount that will ultimately be refunded to the Company at the end of the 30- month
or 42-month settlement period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included in other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005 are deferred financing costs
associated with the Company&#146;s credit facility (see Note 15). Such costs are being amortized over
the life of the credit facility and are included in interest expense on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense associated with deferred financing
costs was approximately $0.1&nbsp;million, $0.5&nbsp;million and $0.6&nbsp;million for the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Disposal of Long-Lived Assets </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;), requires the Company to consider whether
indicators of impairment of long-lived assets held for use (including the Company&#146;s property and
equipment, contracts and other intangibles) are present. If such indicators are present, the
Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to
such assets is less than their carrying amount, and if so, recognizes an impairment loss based on
the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value. Accordingly, management
periodically evaluates the ongoing value of property and equipment and intangible assets and
considers events, circumstances and operating results, including consideration of contract
performance at the fixed price contract level, to determine if impairment exists. If long-lived
assets are deemed impaired, management adjusts the asset value to fair value.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;109&#148;). Under the asset and liability method of SFAS
No.&nbsp;109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the Company to
record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; It further states &#147;forming a conclusion that a
valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative
losses in recent years.&#148; From December&nbsp;31, 2001 to June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company maintained a
100% valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets
that can be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the Company&#146;s results of operations since December&nbsp;31, 2001, and its expected
profitability in future years, the Company concluded, effective June&nbsp;30, 2004, that it is more
likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets will be realized. As a
result, in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to
such net deferred tax assets was reversed in the second quarter of 2004. Reversal of the valuation
allowance resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2004 totaling
approximately $6.6&nbsp;million. This benefit represented the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred
tax assets, excluding those deferred tax assets that resulted from the exercise of employee stock
options. The reversal of the valuation allowance that related to the Company&#146;s estimated
realizable deferred tax assets resulting from the exercises of employee stock options totaled $3.9
million and was recorded as a direct increase to additional paid-in capital in the stockholders&#146;
equity portion of the Company&#146;s balance sheet as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. At December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005,
the Company&#146;s valuation allowance of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million and $0.3&nbsp;million, respectively,
represents management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss carryforwards which will expire
unused.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that
the Company&#146;s tax return positions are fully supported, the Company believes that certain positions
may be challenged and a risk exists that the Company&#146;s positions will not be fully sustained. The
tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of tax audits, case law, and emerging legislation. Adjustments to the tax contingency
accruals are recorded in the period in which the new facts or circumstances become known, therefore
the accruals are subject to change in future periods and such change, if it were to occur, could
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in future periods. The
Company&#146;s tax contingency accruals are reflected as a component of accrued liabilities.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthcare provider, the Company&#146;s business ordinarily results in actions for negligence
and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the attendant risk
of substantial damage awards. The most significant source of potential liability in this regard is
the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services or the lack of timely
adequate healthcare services. The Company may also be liable, as employer, for the negligence of
healthcare professionals it employs or healthcare professionals with whom it contracts. The
Company&#146;s contracts generally provide for the Company to indemnify the governmental agency for
losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the Company and its agents.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate a portion of this risk, the Company maintains a primary professional liability
insurance program, principally on a claims-made basis. However, the Company is effectively
self-insured resulting from the use of adjustable
premium policies in 2002 through 2006. For 2002 and 2003, the Company is covered by
separate policies each of which contains a retro-premium with adjustment based on actual losses
after a minimum of 42&nbsp;months. For 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company is covered by separate policies
each of which contains a retro-premium with adjustment based on actual losses after a minimum of 30
months. The Company&#146;s ultimate premium for its 2002 through 2006 policies will
depend on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods. Management
establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will be incurred under these insurance policies
after taking into consideration internal and external counsel evaluations of the merits of the
individual claims, analysis of claim history, the estimated reserves recommended by the
Company&#146;s third-party administrator and an independent actuarial
analysis. Any adjustments resulting from the review are reflected in
current earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence, in addition to
its reserves for known claims, the Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported
claims. The reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis.
The Company&#146;s estimates of this reserve are supported by an independent actuarial analysis, which
is obtained on a quarterly basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, the Company&#146;s reserves for both known and incurred but not reported
claims totaled $23.5&nbsp;million and $24.6&nbsp;million, respectively. Reserves for medical malpractice
claims fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change
from one period to the next. Furthermore, payments with respect to previously estimated
liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability. Changes in estimates of losses
resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss
payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the
period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company recorded increases of approximately $4.2&nbsp;million, $4.3&nbsp;million and $4.7&nbsp;million,
respectively, to its prior year claims reserves as a result of adverse development. The reserves
can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the third-party insurance carriers used
by the Company. If a third party insurance carrier fails to meet its contractual obligations under
the agreement with the Company, the Company would then be responsible for such obligations. Such
changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period
in which the changes occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Self-funded Insurance Reserves</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had accrued approximately $7.9&nbsp;million for employee
health and workers&#146; compensation claims. Approximately $3.5&nbsp;million of this amount for workers&#146;
compensation claims is included within the noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is not
expected to be paid within a year. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company had approximately $7.1
million in accrued liabilities for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims, all of which
was included in current accrued expenses as it was expected to be paid within a year. The Company
is essentially self-insured for employee health and workers&#146; compensation claims subject to certain
individual case stop loss levels. As such, its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims
experience and the ability to control claims. The Company accrues the estimated liability for
employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between
the incident date and the date of actual claim payment. The Company accrues the estimated
liability for workers&#146; compensation claims based on internal and external evaluations of the merits
of the individual claims, analysis of claims history and the estimated reserves assigned by the
Company&#146;s third-party administrator. On a periodic basis, the Company obtains an independent
actuarial analysis to further support the appropriateness of the workers&#146; compensation reserve.
These estimates of self-funded insurance reserves could change in the future based on changes in
the factors discussed above. Any adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are
reflected in current earnings. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded an increase of
approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, a decrease of approximately $1.4&nbsp;million and an increase of
approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to its prior year other self-insurance reserves as a
result of differences between actual and estimated claims experience.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. </I>In June&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, <I>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#151; an
interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109 </I>(&#147;FIN 48&#148;). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement
No.&nbsp;109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes</I>, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle
recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting FIN 48.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Fair Value Measurement. </I>In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair Value Measurement </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;157&#148;), which provides guidance for using fair
value to measure assets and liabilities, including a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
information used to develop fair value assumptions. It also requires expanded disclosure about the
extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to
measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. The standard applies
whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and
does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November&nbsp;15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;157 to have a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>3. Audit Committee Investigation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;24, 2005, the Company announced that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
(the &#147;Audit Committee&#148;) had initiated an internal investigation into certain matters related to its
subsidiary, SPP. As disclosed in further detail in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, on March&nbsp;15, 2006 the Company announced that the Audit Committee
had concluded its investigation and reached certain conclusions with respect to findings of the
investigation that resulted in an accrual of $3.7&nbsp;million of aggregate refunds due to customers
that were not charged by SPP in accordance with the terms of their
respective contracts, including PHS. In circumstances where
SSP&#146;s incorrect billings resulted in PHS billing its clients
incorrectly, PHS passed the applicable amount through to its clients. This amount plus associated interest represented
management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts due to affected customers, based on the results of the
Audit Committee&#146;s investigation. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has paid approximately $3.1
million of these refunds to customers plus associated interest and tendered the remaining amounts
for payment to the appropriate customers. The ultimate amounts paid could differ from the
Company&#146;s estimates; however, actual amounts to date have not differed materially from the
estimated amounts. There can be no assurance that the Company, a customer or a third-party,
including a governmental entity, will not assert that additional amounts, which may include
penalties are owed to these customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, the Company has recorded $5.3&nbsp;million and $3.7
million, respectively, of Audit Committee investigation and related costs associated with the
investigation described above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>4. Impairment of Goodwill</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company performed its annual impairment analysis as required by
SFAS No.&nbsp;142 and recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to its pharmaceutical distribution
services segment, SPP, of $3.0&nbsp;million to write off the carrying value of goodwill.
 The impairment charge was
primarily attributable to a decrease in the segment&#146;s estimated fair value resulting from a
decline in volume occurring primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006 and from an indication of
value of this segment based on a proposed independent third party
transaction. The estimated fair value of the operating segment was determined based upon consideration of
various valuation methodologies, including multiples of current earnings and projected future cash
flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risk involved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
February&nbsp;28, 2007, the Company entered into a non-binding asset purchase proposal whereby
it intends to sell certain assets of SPP to Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corporation
(&#147;Maxor&#148;). The Company and Maxor are in the process of negotiating a definitive asset purchase
agreement providing for Maxor&#146;s purchase, at book value, of certain assets of SPP at closing,
including certain prepaid assets, inventory, information systems and other property and equipment.
This asset purchase proposal excludes SPP&#146;s goodwill. For further information on this
transaction, see Note 28.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;30, 2004, EMSA Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the Company which was acquired in
January&nbsp;1999, entered into a settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office,
related to allegations, first raised in connection with an investigation of EMSA Correctional
Services (&#147;EMSA&#148;) in 1997, that the Company may have played an indirect role in the improper
billing of Medicaid by independent providers treating incarcerated patients.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office constitutes a complete
resolution and settlement of the claims asserted against EMSA and required EMSA Limited Partnership
to pay $5.0&nbsp;million to the State of Florida. This payment was made by the Company on March&nbsp;30,
2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company and all of its subsidiaries are
released from liability for any alleged actions which might have occurred from December&nbsp;1, 1998 to
March&nbsp;31, 2004. Both parties entered into the settlement agreement to avoid the delay,
uncertainty, inconvenience and expense of protracted litigation. The settlement agreement states
that it is not punitive in purpose or effect, it should not be construed or used as admission of
any fault, wrongdoing or liability whatsoever, and that EMSA specifically denies intentionally
submitting any medical claims in violation of state or federal law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recorded a charge of $5.2&nbsp;million in its results of operations for the first
quarter of 2004, reflecting the settlement agreement with the Florida Attorney General&#146;s office and
related legal expenses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>6. Reserve for Loss Contracts</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the
purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for succeeding
periods. The Company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company performs
this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as
future contractual revenue, projected future healthcare and maintenance costs, projected future
stop-loss insurance recoveries and each contract&#146;s specific terms related to future revenue
increases as compared to increased healthcare costs. The projected future healthcare and
maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management&#146;s estimate of future cost
increases. These estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims
experience as previously noted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. </I>The Company&#146;s contract with
the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (&#147;Maryland DPS&#148;) historically
underperformed, fluctuating between minimal profitability, break even and losses. This contract
was entered into on July&nbsp;1, 2000 to provide comprehensive medical services to four regions of the
Maryland prison system. The initial term of the contract was for the three years ended June&nbsp;30,
2003, with the Maryland DPS having the ability to renew the contract for two additional one-year
terms. The second renewal term of the contract expired June&nbsp;30, 2005. Under the terms of the
contract, the Maryland DPS paid the Company a flat fee per month with certain limited cost-sharing
adjustments for staffing costs, primarily nurses, and the cost of medications related to certain
specific illnesses. The Company was fully at risk for increases in hospitalization and outpatient
costs under the terms of the contract with the Maryland DPS. The contract also contained
provisions that allowed the Maryland DPS to assess penalties if certain staffing or performance
criteria were not maintained. The flat fee paid to the Company was increased annually based on a
portion of the Consumer Price Index.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the flat fee nature of this contract, the Company&#146;s margin under the contract was
significantly impacted by changes in healthcare costs, utilization trends or inmate population.
The Company incurred losses under this contract in April&nbsp;2004 at a level slightly above
expectations. The losses under the contract increased significantly in May&nbsp;2004 to approximately
$1.1&nbsp;million for the month. The primary cause for the increased loss was an unanticipated increase
in hospitalization costs beginning in May&nbsp;2004, resulting from the volume and acuity of services
being provided, the number of HIV and mental health patients and the costs associated with current
treatment guidelines. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss
contract charge of $6.8&nbsp;million, effective June&nbsp;1, 2004, which represented its &#147;most likely&#148;
estimate, at that date, of the future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland
DPS contract through its expiration on June&nbsp;30, 2005. This increase in the reserve for loss
contracts is reflected as a component of the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the
Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. This estimate assumed monthly losses under the
contract would diminish from the May&nbsp;2004 level, which was viewed as an aberration, to
approximately $0.5&nbsp;million per month, including allocated overhead, an amount significantly above
recent historical levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2004, the Company utilized $2.6&nbsp;million of its loss contract
reserve, almost entirely due to the underperformance of the Maryland DPS contract. While actual
monthly losses incurred under the Maryland DPS contract had trended downward from the record loss
in May&nbsp;2004, losses once again increased in September&nbsp;2004, driven primarily by off-site medical
costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off-site medical costs under the Maryland DPS contract averaged $1.3&nbsp;million per month for
June through September&nbsp;2004, as compared with initial estimates of $1.0&nbsp;million per month, based on
historical results. As a result of this new and more severe trend, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $6.0&nbsp;million, effective September&nbsp;30, 2004, to increase its reserve for estimated future
losses and allocated corporate overhead under the Maryland DPS contract until its expiration on
June&nbsp;30, 2005. This increase in the reserve for loss contracts is reflected as a component of the loss
from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations A
fundamental assumption of the $6.0&nbsp;million increase in loss reserve was that the contract would
continue to incur on average $1.4&nbsp;million per month of off-site medical costs through its
termination on June&nbsp;30, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through April&nbsp;2005, actual losses incurred under the contract approximated the estimated
amounts. In May&nbsp;2005, off-site medical costs incurred under the Maryland DPS contract increased to
$1.8&nbsp;million, a level significantly above previous experience. These increased costs continued in
June&nbsp;2005 resulting in the Company recording an additional $1.3&nbsp;million increase to its reserve for
loss contracts. This pre-tax loss contract charge of $1.3&nbsp;million is reflected as a component of
the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of
operations. On June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company&#146;s contract with the Maryland DPS expired.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company no longer has a loss contract reserve.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Baltimore County. </I>In addition to the Maryland DPS contract, the Company was previously
carrying a loss contract reserve for a contract to provide services to a county jail in Baltimore
County, Maryland. The Company contends that the original term of this contract expired on June&nbsp;30,
2005, without Baltimore County (the &#147;County&#148;) exercising the first of three, two-year renewal
options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, the Company sent a letter to the County stating its position that the
Company&#146;s contract to provide services expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s failure to
provide such extension notice. The County is disputing the Company&#146;s contention and has asserted
that it properly exercised the first renewal option and that the term of the contract therefore was
through June&nbsp;30, 2007, with extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In 2005, the County and PHS
agreed to have a judicial authority interpret the contract through formal judicial proceedings,
and, at the County&#146;s request, PHS continued to provide healthcare services to the County pending
the judicial resolution of the dispute, while reserving all of its rights. Finally, during
September&nbsp;2006, amid reciprocal claims of default, both the Company and the County took individual steps to terminate the relationship
between (or the contract, if it is ultimately determined to be in effect by the appellate court in the
proceeding discussed above) the parties. The Company contends that it terminated the relationship
effective September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to various breaches by the
County.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the
County ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two year renewal option by sending a
faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed this ruling. On December&nbsp;6,
2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County
did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the
case to the district court to determine whether the County properly exercised the option by its
conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally decided by the trial court. PHS plans
to vigorously pursue its case with respect to this issue and feels that it has
valid arguments in its favor. However, in the event PHS is not
ultimately successful, and the court determines that the contract was renewed due to the conduct of the
County prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005, such an adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect on the
other two suits between the County and PHS (which are discussed in
Note 23) and therefore on the
Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information about the Baltimore County contract, see Note 23.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of performing its reviews in future periods, the Company might identify
additional contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances.
Circumstances that might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract
in a future period include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions,
unanticipated adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure, inmate population or the
utilization of outside medical services in a contract, where such changes are not offset by
increased healthcare revenues. Should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future
period, the Company would record, in the period in which such identification is made, a reserve for
the estimated future losses that would be incurred under the contract. The identification of a
loss contract in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of
operations in the period in which the reserve is recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>7. Discontinued Operations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;144, each of the Company&#146;s correctional healthcare services contracts is
a component of an entity, whose operations can be distinguished from the rest of the Company.
Therefore, when a correctional healthcare services contract terminates, by expiration or otherwise,
the contract&#146;s operations generally will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company
and classified as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the operations of such contracts, net of
applicable income taxes, have been presented as discontinued operations and prior period
consolidated statements of operations have been reclassified.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbilled accounts receivable generally represent additional revenue earned under
shared-risk contracting models that remain unbilled at each balance sheet date, due to provisions
within the contracts governing the timing for billing such amounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s more
significantly aged receivable balances, net of reserves, are discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in September&nbsp;2005, management made a decision to temporarily suspend billings to SPP
customers until certain findings of the Audit Committee&#146;s internal investigation into matters at
SPP had been reviewed by the Company. Primarily as a result of this decision, SPP had
approximately $7.0&nbsp;million in unbilled receivables at December&nbsp;31, 2005. In February of 2006, SPP
submitted invoices to its customers for these amounts. As of February&nbsp;28, 2007, less than $0.1
million of these receivables remain outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to PHS accounts receivable, at December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had approximately
$1.7&nbsp;million of billed receivables due from clients whose contracts terminated prior to January&nbsp;1,
2006. Approximately $0.3&nbsp;million of this amount is due from clients whose contracts expired prior
to January&nbsp;1, 2005. In addition to the billed receivables due from these former clients, the
Company also has approximately $0.3&nbsp;million of unbilled receivables related to these former clients
which represent aggregate risk sharing receivable amounts which remain unbillable at December&nbsp;31,
2006 based on stated contract terms. This unbilled receivable amount relates to one client whose
contract expired prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005. The Company believes that these receivables are
contractually due under the terms of the respective expired contracts and therefore has recorded no

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">additional reserves related to these amounts. However, due to the age of the receivables and
the lack of an ongoing business relationship between the Company and the clients, there is a
heightened risk of uncollectibility related to these receivables.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its clients will, from time to time, have disputes over amounts billed under
the Company&#146;s contracts. The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts in circumstances
where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company
is involved in a dispute with a current client where the client has withheld approximately $1.8
million from payments of receivables due the Company. The Company has recorded approximately $1.2
million of contractual allowances related to this matter which it estimates as the amount due to
the client for the period in question related to staffing penalties under the contract.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company is involved in a dispute with another current client over
billed receivables totaling approximately $1.1&nbsp;million. The Company has recorded no reserves
related to this amount as it believes the risk of loss is not probable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHS is currently involved in three lawsuits with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland
(the &#147;County&#148;). In addition to the amounts discussed above, as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, PHS has
approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of receivables due from this former client, primarily related to
services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006. The County has refused to pay PHS
for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS filed suit against the County in the
Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of the outstanding receivable
balances and damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit and unjust enrichment. The Company
believes, in the case of the lawsuit filed in October&nbsp;2006 that it has a valid and meritorious
cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the outstanding receivables, which represent
services performed under the relationship between the parties, are probable of collection. In the
case of the two declaratory judgment actions described in Note 23, the Company believes it has
valid contractual and legal arguments, however, an adverse result in either or both of these cases
could have a negative impact on the Company&#146;s ability to collect the outstanding receivable amount.
For more information about the Baltimore County contract, see Note 23.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in each of the cases above, the Company believes the recorded amounts represent
valid receivables which are contractually due from clients, and other than the recorded reserves,
expects full collection. However, due to the factors discussed above, there is a heightened risk
of uncollectibility related to each of these circumstances which may result in future losses in
excess of such reserves. Nevertheless, the Company intends to take all necessary and available
measures in order to collect these receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in circumstances related to the matters discussed above, or any other receivables,
could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate of contractual
adjustments in future periods. Such change, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse
affect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position in the period in which the
change occurs.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and
Security Agreement with CapitalSource Finance, LLC (&#147;Lender&#148;) which was subsequently amended on
March&nbsp;14, 2006 and on October&nbsp;31, 2006 (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) to amend debt covenant requirements
with which the Company would not have been in compliance. The Credit Agreement matures on October
31, 2008 and includes a $50.0&nbsp;million revolving credit facility under which the Company may have
standby letters of credit issued in amounts up to $15.0&nbsp;million. The amount available to the
Company for borrowings under the Credit Agreement is reduced by the amount of each outstanding
standby letter of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all assets of the
Company and its operating subsidiaries. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Agreement totaling $10.0&nbsp;million and $16.2&nbsp;million available for
additional borrowing, based on the Company&#146;s collateral base on that date, less a reserve against
availability pending the Lenders&#146; review of the outcome of the Audit Committee&#146;s internal
investigation into matters at SPP of $5.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006, and outstanding standby
letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to maintain a minimum
outstanding borrowings balance (the &#147;Minimum Borrowing Balance&#148;) of $10.0&nbsp;million to October&nbsp;31,
2007 and $7.5&nbsp;million from October&nbsp;31, 2007 to October&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;85% of eligible
receivables less a reserve against availability pending the Lenders&#146; review of the outcome of the
Company&#146;s internal investigation into matters at SPP (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (2)
$50.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;Borrowing Capacity&#148;). Interest under the Credit Agreement is payable monthly
at an annual rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.75% if the Company&#146;s trailing twelve month EBITDA is
less than $40.0&nbsp;million or 2.25% if the Company&#146;s trailing twelve month EBITDA is greater than
$40.0&nbsp;million. The Company&#146;s interest rate at December&nbsp;31, 2006 was 8.1%. The Company is also
required to pay a monthly collateral management fee equal to 0.0625% on average borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a monthly unused line
fee equal to a monthly rate of 0.0375% on the Borrowing Capacity less the actual average borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Agreement for the month, the reserve against availability pending
the Lenders&#146; review of the outcome of the Company&#146;s internal investigation into matters at SPP and
the balance of any outstanding letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agrement will be due and payable on October&nbsp;31, 2008.
If the Credit Agreement is extinguished prior to August&nbsp;1, 2008, the Company will be required to
pay an early termination fee equal to between 1.5% and 2.5% of the Borrowing Capacity depending on
the date extinguished. The Credit Agreement requires a lockbox agreement which provides for all
receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. This agreement, combined with the
existence of a Material Adverse Effect (&#147;MAE&#148;) clause in the Credit Agreement, requires the
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement to be classified as a current liability, in
accordance with EITF Issue No.&nbsp;95-22, <I>Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under
Revolving Credit Agreements that Include Both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box
Arrangement</I>. The MAE clause, which is a common requirement in commercial credit agreements, allows
the Lender to require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s operations, business, properties, assets, liabilities, condition or
prospects. The classification of the Credit Agreement as a current liability is a result only of
the combination of the two aforementioned factors: the mandatory lockbox agreements and the MAE
clause. The Credit

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants related to
minimum levels of earnings. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company was not in compliance with one of
the covenant requirements and has obtained a waiver of the debt covenant from the Lender.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is dependent on the availability of borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement to
meet its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and other cash flow requirements
during 2007. Management believes that the Company can comply with the terms of the Credit
Agreement and meet its expected obligations throughout 2007. However, should the Company fail to
meet its projected results, it may be forced to seek additional sources of financing in order to
fund its working capital needs. No assurances can be made that the Company can obtain alternative
financing arrangements on terms acceptable to it, or at all.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into
consideration such factors as historical financial results, projected future taxable income and the
expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires the
Company to record a valuation allowance when it is &#147;more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#148; It further states &#147;forming a conclusion that a
valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative
losses in recent years.&#148; From December&nbsp;31, 2001 to June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company maintained a
100% valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets
that can be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the Company&#146;s results of operations since December&nbsp;31, 2001, and its expected
profitability in future years, the Company concluded, effective June&nbsp;30, 2004, that it is more
likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets will be realized. As a
result, in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to
such net deferred tax assets was reversed in the second quarter of 2004. Reversal of the valuation
allowance resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit in the second
quarter of 2004 totaling $6.6 million. This benefit represented the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax assets,
excluding those deferred tax assets that resulted from the exercise of employee stock options. The
reversal of the valuation allowance that related to the Company&#146;s estimated realizable deferred tax
assets resulting from the exercises of employee stock options totaled $3.9&nbsp;million and was recorded
as a direct increase to additional paid-in capital in the stockholders&#146; equity portion of the
Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. At December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company&#146;s valuation allowance of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million and $0.3&nbsp;million, respectively,
represents management&#146;s estimate of state net operating loss carryforwards which will expire
unused.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
$17.5&nbsp;million and $35.6&nbsp;million, respectively, which expire at various dates through
2023. Included in current deferred tax assets at December&nbsp;31, 2006 are federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards that management estimates will be utilized in 2007.
</DIV>

income from continuing operations, is as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had tax contingency reserves totaling
approximately $0.5&nbsp;million, which are included in accrued expenses on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;16, 2004, stockholders of the Company authorized a proposal to amend the Company&#146;s
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock
it is authorized to issue from 10,000,000 shares to 20,000,000. Currently, the Company has
2,000,000 authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;15, 2005, the Company issued 9,000 shares of restricted stock to its Board of
Directors. On June&nbsp;14, 2006 and September&nbsp;6, 2006, the Company issued 44,500 shares and 6,000
shares, respectively, of restricted stock to its Board of Directors. The restricted shares were
valued at the market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant and are being
recognized as compensation expense over the restricted stock&#146;s vesting period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;25, 2005, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to
repurchase up to $30&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s common stock
over an approximate two year period. See Note 20
for further information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>18. Share-Based Compensation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has several approved stock incentive plans for its eligible employees and outside
directors. The Company currently has two types of share-based awards outstanding under these
plans: stock options and restricted stock. Additionally, the Company instituted an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan during 1996. Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company accounted for these plans under
the recognition and measurement provisions of APB No.&nbsp;25 as permitted by SFAS No.&nbsp;123.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R), using the modified prospective
transition method. Under the modified prospective transition method, recognized compensation cost
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 includes (i)&nbsp;compensation cost for all share-based payments
granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January&nbsp;1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123; and (ii)&nbsp;compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted on or after January&nbsp;1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective method,
the Company has not restated prior period results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company recognized total share-based compensation
cost of $4.3&nbsp;million which consisted of $0.4&nbsp;million classified in healthcare expenses and $3.9
million classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. These amounts include restricted stock share-based compensation that was
already being reflected in net income prior to the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R). For the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company also recognized a total income tax benefit in the consolidated
statements of operations for share-based compensation arrangements of $1.5&nbsp;million. The Company
did not capitalize any share-based compensation cost.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income from continuing operations before income taxes, income from continuing operations and
the net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 were all negatively impacted as a result of
adopting SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) by amounts totaling $4.2&nbsp;million, $2.7&nbsp;million and $2.7&nbsp;million,
respectively. The effect of adopting SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) on basic and diluted earnings per common
share for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 was $0.25 per common share.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to adopting SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R), the Company presented the tax benefit of stock option
exercises as operating cash flows. SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) requires that tax benefits resulting from tax
deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options be classified as
financing cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has elected to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits under the alternative
transition method described in FASB Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) No.&nbsp;FAS 123(R)-3, <I>Transition Election
Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards</I>, which also specifies the
method the Company must use to calculate excess tax benefits reported on the statement of cash
flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss)&nbsp;per common share as if the
Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123 for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands except per share data):

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has an Incentive Stock Plan (the &#147;Incentive Plan&#148;) which provides for the
granting of options, stock awards and stock appreciation rights to officers, key employees and
non-employee directors for up to 2,224,500 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. Awards and
vesting periods under the Incentive Plan are discretionary and are administered by the Incentive
Stock and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;). The
exercise price of the options shall not be less than the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common
stock at the date of grant. Options and other benefits expire at such times as the Compensation
Committee determines at the time of grant, but no later than ten years from the grant date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective June&nbsp;16, 2004, stockholders of the Company approved the America Service Group Inc.
Amended and Restated 1999 Incentive Stock Plan (the &#147;Amended Plan&#148;) to attract and retain eligible
employees and outside directors of the Company, to provide an incentive to eligible employees and
outside directors to work to increase the value of the Company&#146;s common stock and to provide
eligible employees and outside directors with a stake in the future of the Company which
corresponds to the stake of each stockholder. There are 2,439,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock authorized under the Amended Plan. The exercise price of the options shall not be less than
the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant. Options and other
benefits expire at such times as the Committee determines at the time of grant, but no later than
10&nbsp;years from the grant date. Additionally, the Amended Plan does not permit loans to eligible
employees and outside directors for the purchase of common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Incentive Plan and the Amended Plan, the Company has also granted options
to certain members of executive management to purchase 352,500 shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock (the &#147;Executive Plans&#148;). The exercise price of these options equaled the fair market value
of the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant. The options expire 10&nbsp;years from the date of
grant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, there were 283,592 options available for future grants under the above
plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, there were $4.9&nbsp;million of total unrecognized compensation costs
related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the stock incentive plans
discussed above. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.66
years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company estimated the fair value of
each option award on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company
based expected volatility on historical volatility. The Company estimated the expected term of
stock options using historical exercise and employee termination experience. The following table
shows the weighted average assumptions used to develop the fair value estimates:

receives 1,500 restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock on an annual basis. Each new
Director and each non-employee director shall have the right, among other rights, to receive cash
dividends on all of these shares and to vote such shares unless the director&#146;s right to such shares

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company instituted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 1996 pursuant to which an
aggregate of 750,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock may be sold. The Employee Stock Purchase
Plan allows eligible employees to elect to purchase shares of common stock through voluntary
automatic payroll deductions of up to 10% of the employee&#146;s annual salary. Purchases of stock
under the plan are made at the end of two six-month offering periods each year, one beginning on
January 1 and one beginning on July 1. At the end of each six-month period, the employee&#146;s
contributions during that six-month period are used to purchase shares of common stock from the
Company at 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of that
six-month period, whichever is lower. The employee may elect to discontinue participation in the
plan at any time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, there were 353,210 shares available for future employee purchases under
the above plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records compensation expense for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the
fair value of the employees&#146; purchase rights, which is estimated using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The following table shows the weighted average assumptions used to develop the fair
value estimates for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>19. Net Income Per Share</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net income per share is measured at two levels: basic income per share and diluted income per
share. Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding after considering the additional
dilution related to other dilutive securities. The Company&#146;s other dilutive securities outstanding
consist of options to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. The table below sets forth
the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share as required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;128, <I>Earnings Per Share </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;128&#148;)<I>, </I>for the three years in the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;25, 2005, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to
repurchase up to $30&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s common stock
over an approximate two-year period. Under the stock
repurchase program, no shares shall be repurchased directly from officers or directors of the
Company and the common stock repurchased shall be retired. The repurchase program does not
obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the repurchase program
may be suspended at any time at the Company&#146;s discretion. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006,
the Company repurchased and retired a total of 963,836 common shares at an aggregate cost of
approximately $12.4&nbsp;million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has repurchased and retired a
total of 1,112,936 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $15.3&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) covering substantially all
employees who have completed one year and 1,000 hours of service. The Plan permits eligible
employees to defer and contribute to the Plan a portion of their compensation. The Company may, at
the Board&#146;s discretion, match such employee contributions to the Plan ranging from 1% to 3% of
eligible compensation, depending on the employee&#146;s years of participation. The Company made no
matching contributions in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company records a liability for reported as well as unreported professional and general
liability claims. Amounts accrued were $23.5&nbsp;million and $24.6&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and
2005, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and non-current portion of accrued
expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in estimates of losses resulting from the
continuous review process and differences between estimates and loss payments are recognized in
the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made. Reserves for professional and
general liability exposures are subject to fluctuations in frequency and severity. Given the
inherent degree of variability in any such estimates, the reserves reported at December&nbsp;31, 2006
represent management&#146;s best estimate of the amounts necessary to discharge the Company&#146;s
obligations.

for the years ended December&nbsp;31 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Catastrophic Limits</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Company&#146;s contracts require the Company&#146;s customers to reimburse the Company for
all treatment costs or, in some cases, only treatment costs related to certain catastrophic
events, and/or for AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses. Certain contracts do not contain such limits.
The Company attempts to compensate for the increased financial risk when pricing contracts that do
not contain individual, catastrophic or specific disease diagnosis-related limits. However, the
occurrence of severe individual cases, AIDS-related illnesses or a catastrophic event in a
facility governed by a contract without such limitations could render the contract unprofitable
and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations. For contracts that do not
contain catastrophic protection, the Company typically maintains stop loss insurance from an
unaffiliated insurer with respect to, among other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital
expenses (as defined in the policy) for amounts in excess of $300,000 per inmate up to an annual
and a lifetime cap of $1.0&nbsp;million per inmate. Amounts reimbursable per claim under the policy
are further limited to the lesser of 60% of billed charges, the amount paid or the contracted
amounts in situations where the Company has negotiated rates with the applicable providers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Lake Professional Liability Suit. </I>On July&nbsp;15, 2005, EMSA, a limited partnership owned by the
Company, received an adverse jury verdict in United States District Court for the Northern District
of New York in Albany, New York. The verdict relates to a claim regarding the plaintiff&#146;s medical
care while incarcerated in the Schoharie and Schenectady County, New York jails in December&nbsp;1998,
prior to the Company&#146;s acquisition of EMSA in 1999. The adverse verdict consisted of an indemnity
award to plaintiff of $150,000 to be allocated among four defendants and an assessment of punitive
damages totaling approximately $633,000 against EMSA. EMSA subsequently filed post-trial motions
challenging the appropriateness and amounts of the verdict. On January&nbsp;3, 2006, the trial court
entered a judgment as a matter of law in favor of EMSA that had the effect of dismissing the
verdict for punitive damages against EMSA in its entirety. The indemnity award was unaffected by
such ruling and still stands as entered. The plaintiff has appealed this ruling in favor of EMSA.
EMSA is vigorously defending the appeal. If EMSA is not successful and the punitive damages
verdict is reinstated, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial
position and its quarterly or annual results of operations. EMSA is appealing the underlying
indemnity award against it. Plaintiff has also requested prevailing party attorney fees in excess
of $225,000 (and increasing as the appeal proceeds), which EMSA is contesting vigorously. The
Company&#146;s exposure related to the indemnity award is covered under its

Circuit Court, 11<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> Judicial Circuit, Miami-Dade County, Florida of
approximately $1.2&nbsp;million plus potential interest which has the potential to double the amount of
the award to $2.5&nbsp;million. This verdict relates to a 12&nbsp;year old case filed by the plaintiff,
Community Health Related Services, Inc. (&#147;CHRS&#148;) seeking unspecified damages involving a lease
dispute in connection with a line of business managing physician clinics operated by EMSA prior to
its acquisition by the Company in 1999. However, on December&nbsp;9, 2005, the trial court granted
EMSA&#146;s post trial motion for Judgment in Accordance with Motion for Directed Verdict, which had the
effect of setting aside the above-referenced jury verdict, and entered a judgment in favor of EMSA
and against CHRS. In addition, the trial court ruled that in the event its ruling dismissing the
jury verdict was reversed on appeal, EMSA would then be entitled to a new trial. As of December
31, 2006, the Company has no reserves associated with this proceeding. CHRS has filed an Appeal in
the Florida Third District Court of Appeal. EMSA is vigorously defending the appeal. In the event
both trial court rulings set forth above are overturned, the original verdict against EMSA could be
reinstated. Alternatively, if the jury verdict is reversed on appeal and EMSA receives a new
trial, EMSA could receive an adverse verdict at the conclusion of such new trial. Either such
occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its
quarterly or annual results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the Company has filed suit against Caremark Rx, Inc. (&#147;Caremark&#148;), the successor
to the party who sold EMSA to the Company, for indemnification for all costs associated with this
case as well as any judgment returned which is adverse to the Company. Caremark is defending this
lawsuit and the trial court has stayed all proceedings until final resolution of the above
referenced CHRS matter is reached. Accordingly, the Company does not know whether it will prevail
against Caremark.

Inc. </I>On August&nbsp;1, 2005, Plaintiff, Albert Einstein Healthcare Network, filed suit against the City
of Philadelphia and PHS in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, seeking damages in the
amount of $1.7&nbsp;million (plus interest) and punitive damages in the amount of $0.5&nbsp;million.
Plaintiff alleges that it rendered medical and/or surgical services to prisoners/arrestees for
which the defendants were obligated to pay pursuant to an implied contract resulting from an
extended course of dealing. Plaintiff alleges that defendants have failed to pay for such
services. Plaintiff further has alleged that PHS, in acting as the City of Philadelphia&#146;s third
party administrator, fraudulently withheld payment for such services from Plaintiff. On December
27, 2005, the trial court dismissed Plaintiff&#146;s punitive damages claim. PHS believes that it has
viable affirmative defenses and cross claims as to this cause of action. However, in the event PHS
is not successful at the trial court level, an adverse judgment could have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has no reserves associated with this proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County, Indiana v. Prison Health Services, Inc.</I>
On or about April&nbsp;12, 2006, Plaintiff, The Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County,
Indiana filed suit against PHS in the Marion County (Indiana) Superior Court, Civil Division,
seeking damages in the amount of approximately $1.1&nbsp;million plus all allowable interest, costs and
fees. Plaintiff alleges that, pursuant to a contract between Plaintiff and PHS, Plaintiff provided
medical care to prisoners of the Indiana Department of Corrections; services for which PHS is
financially responsible. Plaintiff alleges that PHS has failed to pay
for such services. PHS has accrued for the costs associated with
these services, net of customary adjustments made in
the claims adjudication process (the &#147;Accrued Amount&#148;), which Accrued Amount PHS believes reflects
the amount, if any, owed to the Plaintiff. However, irrespective of the aforementioned accrual,
PHS believes it has amounts due from the Plaintiff that if recouped would offset substantially all
of the Accrued Amount. Such amounts due are the result of the Plaintiff&#146;s overbilling and PHS&#146;
resulting overpayment for services unrelated to those that are the subject of the lawsuit. As a
result, PHS believes that it has viable defenses and counterclaims as to this cause of action. However, in the
event PHS is not successful at the trial court level, an adverse judgment could have a material
adverse affect on the Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results of
operations.

individual physician independent contractor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a putative class
action suit against PHS and the City of Philadelphia in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia
County, Trial Division, seeking unspecified damages for the class, but damages in the amount of at
least $9,588 individually. Plaintiff alleges that he provided services to inmates in the
Philadelphia Prison System at the request of the defendants and that the defendants breached the
alleged contractual duties owed to him by paying an amount alleged to be less than the full amount
Plaintiff billed for his medical services. On September&nbsp;22, 2006, the City of Philadelphia filed a
New Matter Crossclaim against PHS alleging breach of contract, negligence and seeking
indemnification. On September&nbsp;29, 2006, PHS filed its Answer to Plaintiff&#146;s complaint, which
Answer included a crossclaim against the City of Philadelphia for contribution and indemnification.

and as to the substantive claims of these causes of action. However, in the event PHS is not

about February&nbsp;8, 2007, the Company&#146;s subsidiary, CHS, was served with a lawsuit by Plaintiff,
Saint Joseph&#146;s Regional Medical Center. Plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court of New Jersey,
Law Division: Passaic County, against CHS, Barnert Hospital, County of Bergen, Bergen County Jail,
County of Essex, Essex County Jail, County of Hudson, Hudson County Jail, County of Passaic and
Passaic County Jail, &#147;John Does #1-30&#148;, &#147;ABC Corporations #1-30&#148;, &#147;XYZ Jails, Prisons and/or
Detention Centers&#148; seeking damages from CHS totaling approximately $2.5&nbsp;million. Plaintiff
claims that CHS failed to administer various contracts with respect to the medical claims for the
treatment of certain patients and the payment of such claims between each of the respective
counties and jails named in the complaint and Barnert Hospital, to which St. Joseph claims it was
an intended third-party beneficiary. CHS intends to defend itself vigorously, however, the
proceedings are at a preliminary stage and the Company is unable to predict the ultimate
outcome. However, a judgment adverse to CHS could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations.
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Matters involving PHS and Baltimore County, Maryland. </I>PHS is currently involved in three
lawsuits with its former client, Baltimore County, Maryland (the &#147;County&#148;). The first lawsuit
involves the term of PHS&#146; contract with the County. PHS contends that the original term of this
contract expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005, without the County exercising the first of three, two-year
renewal options. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, PHS sent a letter to the County stating its position that PHS&#146;
contract to provide services expired on June&nbsp;30, 2005 due to the County&#146;s failure to provide such
extension notice. The County is disputing PHS&#146; contention and has asserted that it properly
exercised the first renewal option and that the term of the contract therefore was through June&nbsp;30,
2007, with extension options through June&nbsp;30, 2011. In 2005, the County and PHS agreed to have a
judicial authority interpret the contract through formal judicial proceedings, and, at the County&#146;s
request, PHS continued to provide healthcare services to the County pending the judicial resolution
of the dispute, while reserving all of its rights. Finally, during
September&nbsp;2006, amid reciprocal claims of default, both PHS and the
County took individual steps to terminate the relationship between (or the contract, if it is
ultimately determined to be in effect by the court in the proceeding discussed above) the parties.
PHS contends that it terminated the relationship effective September&nbsp;14, 2006, due to various
breaches by the County.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland ruled in favor of the
County ruling that the County properly exercised its first, two year renewal option by sending a
faxed written renewal amendment to PHS on July&nbsp;1, 2005. PHS appealed this ruling. On December&nbsp;6,
2006, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals (i)&nbsp;reversed this judgment; (ii)&nbsp;ruled that the County
did not timely exercise its renewal option by its actions of July&nbsp;1, 2005; and (iii)&nbsp;remanded the
case to the district court to determine whether the County properly exercised the option by its
conduct prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005 &#151; an issue not originally decided by the trial court. PHS plans
to vigorously pursue its case with respect to this issue and feels that it has
valid arguments in its favor. However, in the event PHS is not
ultimately successful and the court determines that the contract was renewed due to the conduct of the County
prior to June&nbsp;30, 2005, such an adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect on the other
two suits between the County and PHS (which are discussed below) and therefore on the Company&#146;s
financial position and its quarterly or annual results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second lawsuit revolves around the County&#146;s actions on or about May&nbsp;5, 2006, when it
opened a new detention facility. PHS is of the opinion that this new facility increased the
staffing and equipment required to service the County contract in a material fashion not
contemplated by the initial contract. The County informed PHS that it expected PHS to provide the
same services at the new facility at no increase in price. Accordingly, on or about July&nbsp;12, 2006,
PHS filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against the County in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore County, Maryland seeking to have the Court declare that PHS is under no obligation to
provide personnel or services to the County at the new facility. During the pendency of this
second lawsuit, PHS was providing services at the new facility under a reservation of rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally,
as a result of the termination discussed above and the County&#146;s claims of default,
as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, PHS has approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of receivables due from this former
client, primarily related to services rendered between April&nbsp;1, 2006 and September&nbsp;14, 2006. The
County has refused to pay PHS for these amounts and therefore, on October&nbsp;27, 2006, PHS filed suit
against the County in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland seeking collection of the
outstanding receivable balances and damages for breach of contract, quantum meruit and unjust
enrichment. PHS believes, in the case of the lawsuit filed in October&nbsp;2006 that it has a valid and
meritorious cause of action and, as a result, has concluded that the outstanding receivables, which
represent services performed under the relationship between the
parties, are probable of
collection. However, although PHS believes it has valid
contractual and legal arguments, an adverse result in either or both
of the two declaratory judgment actions could
have a negative impact on PHS&#146; ability to collect the outstanding receivable amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the three suits is currently separate and distinct; however, the ultimate resolution
of any of these suits could influence the ultimate outcome of the remaining suits. Should PHS be
unsuccessful in any or all of these suits, such result could have a
material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s financial position and its quarterly or annual results
of operations.

Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee in the informal inquiry it is conducting. Both the
Audit Committee and the Company intend to continue to cooperate with those government entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholder Litigation. </I>On April&nbsp;6, 2006, plaintiffs filed the first of four similar
securities class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee against the Company and the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. Plaintiffs&#146; allegations in these class action lawsuits are substantially identical and
generally allege on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased the Company&#146;s common
stock between September&nbsp;24, 2003 and March&nbsp;16, 2006 that, prior to the Company&#146;s announcement of
the Audit Committee investigation, the Company and/or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934 and SEC Rule&nbsp;10b-5 by making false and misleading statements, or concealing information about
the Company&#146;s business, forecasts and financial performance. The complaints seek certification as
a class action, unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys&#146; fees and costs, and other relief. By
order dated August&nbsp;3, 2006, the district court consolidated the lawsuits into one consolidated
action and on October&nbsp;31, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding SPP, Enoch E. Hartman
III and Grant J. Bryson as defendants. The amended complaint also generally alleges that
defendants made false and misleading statements concerning the Company&#146;s business which caused the
Company&#146;s securities to trade at inflated prices during the class period. Plaintiff seeks an
unspecified amount of damages in the form of (i)&nbsp;restitution; (ii)&nbsp;compensatory damages, including
interest; and (iii)&nbsp;reasonable costs and expenses. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended
complaint on January&nbsp;19, 2007, and the Company expects briefing on the motion to be complete by May
2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Company believes that it has meritorious liability and damages defenses to the
securities class action and intends to defend it vigorously, it is unable at this time to predict
the outcome of this action or reasonably estimate a range of possible damages. The Company
maintains directors and officers liability (&#147;D&#038;O&#148;) insurance that may provide coverage for some or
all of these matters. It has given notice to its D&#038;O insurers of the claims described above. There
is risk that some or all of the claims will not be covered by such policies; or that, even if
covered, the Company&#146;s ultimate liability will exceed the available limits of insurance.
Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the
Company&#146;s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or stock price.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholder Derivative Litigation. </I>On or about May&nbsp;26, 2006, Plaintiff, Susan Battersby
brought a shareholders&#146; derivative action on behalf of the Company against Company officers Michael
Catalano and Michael W. Taylor and former and current Company directors, William D. Eberle, Burton
C. Einspruch, Michael E. Gallagher, Carol R. Goldberg, Richard M. Mastaler and Richard W. Wright,
individually, and the Company, as a nominal defendant. The suit was filed in the Circuit Court for
Williamson County, Tennessee, seeking (i)&nbsp;money damages in the amount of $70&nbsp;million, (ii)
disgorgement by the individual defendants of all profits, special benefits and unjust enrichment,
(iii)&nbsp;actions to reform and improve its corporate governance and internal controls, (iv)&nbsp;punitive
damages, and (v)&nbsp;attorney&#146;s fees. Plaintiff alleged that the defendants acted in a grossly
negligent and reckless manner so as to cause the Company to violate the federal securities laws.
On July&nbsp;21, 2006, all parties to the action entered into a joint Stipulated Order of Dismissal to
dismiss the action in its entirety. This order was entered by the presiding judge on July&nbsp;27,
2006, and as such, this action has been dismissed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Delaware Department of Justice Inquiry</I>. On April&nbsp;4, 2006, the Company received a letter
notifying it that the Office of the Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice is conducting
an inquiry into the payment of claims by the Delaware Department of Correction to SPP beginning in
July&nbsp;2002 and ending in the Spring of 2005 for pharmaceutical services. The Company has cooperated
and intends to continue to cooperate with the Delaware Department of Justice during its inquiry.

proceedings incidental to its business. An estimate of the amounts payable on existing claims for

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is required under certain contracts to provide a performance bond. At December
31, 2006, the Company had outstanding performance bonds totaling $12.0&nbsp;million. The performance
bonds are renewed on an annual basis. The market for performance bonds was severely impacted by
certain corporate failures in recent years and the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001 and continues to
be impacted by general economic conditions. Consequently, the sureties for the Company&#146;s
performance bond program may require additional collateral to issue or renew performance bonds in
support of certain contracts. The Company has letters of credit in the amount of $5.0&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2006 that collateralize these performance bonds, reduce availability under the
Company&#146;s credit facility and limit funds available for debt service and working capital. The
Company is also dependant on the financial health of the surety companies that it relies on to
issue its performance bonds. An inability to obtain new or renew existing performance bonds could
result in limitations on the Company&#146;s ability to bid for new or renew existing contracts which

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed further in Notes 2 and 7, the Company follows the guidance in SFAS No.&nbsp;144,
which requires that terminated or expired correctional healthcare service contracts be eliminated
from the ongoing operations of the Company and classified as discontinued operations.
Accordingly, the operations of such contracts, net of applicable income taxes, have been presented
as discontinued operations and prior period quarterly financial data has been reclassified.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
following table is a summary of the Company&#146;s unaudited quarterly statements of operations data
for 2006 and 2005 (in thousands except per share data). Earnings per
share for each quarter are computed independently of earnings per
share for the year. The sum of the quarterly earnings per share may
not equal the earnings per share for the year because of: (i)
transactions affecting the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding in each quarter; and (ii) the uneven distribution of
earnings during the year.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2007, the Company entered into a non-binding asset purchase proposal whereby
it intends to sell certain assets of SPP to Maxor. The Company and Maxor are in the process of
negotiating a definitive asset purchase agreement providing for Maxor&#146;s purchase at book value of
certain assets of SPP at closing, including certain prepaid assets, inventory, information systems
and other property and equipment. As part of the proposed transaction, Maxor and PHS will enter
into a long-term supply contract pursuant to which Maxor will be the exclusive provider of
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to PHS (except where prohibited
by contract or for the occasional use of local backup pharmacies). The Company and Maxor are currently targeting the
closing of this transaction effective March&nbsp;31, 2007. The final execution of a definitive asset
purchase agreement, long-term supply contract and closing of the transaction is subject to final
negotiations of the agreements, completion of due diligence and final approval of the respective
companies&#146; boards of directors, among other things.
