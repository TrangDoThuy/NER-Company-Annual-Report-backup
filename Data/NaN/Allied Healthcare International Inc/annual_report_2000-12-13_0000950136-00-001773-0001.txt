                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

         GENERAL

         Transworld Healthcare, Inc. (the "Company") is a provider of a broad
range of health care services and products with operations in the United Kingdom
("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S."). The Company provides the following
services and products: (i) patient services, including nursing and
para-professional services; (ii) respiratory therapy and home medical equipment;
and (iii) infusion therapy. The Company provides these services and products
from the following reportable business segments: (i) U.K. operations ("U.K.
Operations"); and (ii) U.S. hi-tech operations ("Hi-Tech Operations"). The
Company's U.K. Operations include the U.K.'s second largest commercial provider
of nursing and para-professional care to the community and U.K. healthcare
institutions, the U.K.'s second largest home respiratory supplier as well as a
leading value-added medical supplies distributor, all with operations located
throughout the U.K. The Company's Hi-Tech Operations are concentrated in New
Jersey and New York.

         The Company was a provider of specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals and
medical supplies ("Mail-Order Operations"). The Company provided these services
from the reportable business segment of its U.S. Mail-Order Operations, through
the year ended September 30, 2000, to patients in their home nationwide and in
Puerto Rico. In September 2000, the Company entered into an agreement, which was
completed on October 3, 2000, to sell a substantial portion of the assets of its
U.S. Mail-Order Operations (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).

         On December 20, 1999, the Company's U.K. subsidiaries obtained new
financing (the "Refinancing"). As a result of the provisions of the Voting Trust
(as defined and described in Liquidity and Capital Resources) the Company did
not hold a majority interest of the board of directors. The Investors (as
defined and described in Liquidity and Capital Resources) held substantive
rights, principally in the form of their ability to approve the annual budget
and financial forecast of results of operations and sources and uses of cash.
Therefore, the Company was no longer able to consolidate the U.K. subsidiaries
into its financial statements although it owned 100% of the outstanding shares
of the stock of the parent company, Transworld Holdings (UK) Limited ("UK
Parent"), as of December 31, 1999. Therefore, effective with the Refinancing,
the Company began accounting for the investment in UK Parent and its
subsidiaries under the equity method, retroactive to October 1, 1999. During the
second quarter of fiscal 2000, UK Parent and Transworld Healthcare (UK) Limited
("TW UK") amended their Articles of Association to give the Chairman (a Company
designee) the right to resolve any tie votes of the board of directors and
certain documents covering the Notes (as defined and described in Liquidity and
Capital Resources) were amended to eliminate the requirement that the Investors
approve the operating budget. These amendments have enabled the Company to
consolidate the U.K. subsidiaries as of January 1, 2000.

         The Company changed its fiscal year end from October 31 to September 30
effective for fiscal 1997. This resulted in an eleven month reporting period
ended September 30, 1997 (sometimes referred to herein as the "Eleven Month
Period") included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

         The Company's principal executive offices are located at 555 Madison
Avenue, New York, New York 10022, and the Company's telephone number at that
location is (212) 750-0064.





                                       1

         STRATEGY

         The Company's strategic focus is to become the leading health care
staffing and services company in the U.K. The Company's growth strategy is to
take advantage of policy moves by the government funded National Health Service
("NHS") and by private payors seeking to treat a much larger number of patients
than in the past and to shorten waiting lists for access to care, as well as the
general trend of local government toward outsourcing its home care requirements
to private industry.

         It is the Company's intention to focus on internal growth, as well as
to acquire additional nursing and other care giving operations to expand and
complement its existing operations. The Company believes that the health care
staffing and services industry in the U.K. is highly fragmented and that
additional acquisition opportunities will continue to arise in a general trend
toward industry consolidation. Consistent with this strategy, the Company
acquired 12, 10 and 7 nursing and care giving operations in the U.K. during
fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         On April 6, 2000 TW UK acquired all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Nightingale Nursing Bureau Limited ("Nightingale"), a London based
provider of registered nursing and care staff to NHS Trust Hospitals and the
independent sector, with an additional branch in Sydney, Australia, for
approximately $15,362,000, plus an additional sum of up to approximately
$5,600,000 in deferred consideration dependent upon Pre-Tax Profits (as defined
in the agreement for sale and purchase) for certain periods ending in 2000 and
2001.

         Approximately $13,691,000 of the purchase price for the acquisition was
paid using cash on hand and funds borrowed under TW UK's senior credit
facilities with the approximate remaining $1,671,000 of consideration being paid
in 1,050,000 shares of 5 pence par value class A1 common shares of TW UK.

         The Company believes that valuations for health care staffing and
services companies in the U.K. market are significantly more attractive than in
the U.S. Therefore, the Company has executed a program to establish its U.K.
Operations as a stand-alone entity with its own financing in order to execute an
aggressive expansion program. To that end, on December 20, 1999, the Company's
U.K. subsidiaries completed a $125,700,000 refinancing which repaid the
Company's existing senior indebtedness of $55,755,000 and provided approximately
$46,000,000 for additional acquisitions in the U.K. (See "Liquidity and Capital
Resources - Refinancing").

         The Company believes that by structuring its U.K. Operations as a stand
alone entity, it enables the U.K. subsidiaries to raise capital on more
favorable terms than may be available currently in the U.S. In addition it
positions the Company to maximize the value of its ownership interest in the
U.K. Operations in the future, whether by way of a public offering of the U.K.
Operation's shares, through a strategic business combination, or other
alternative means.

                                       2

         The Company also seeks to expand its Hi-Tech Operations through
marketing its services to physicians, managed care organizations, hospitals, and
other referral sources in its market area.


         U.K. OPERATIONS

         U.K. SERVICES AND PRODUCTS

         The Company provides the following services and products in the U.K.:
(i) patient services, principally nursing and para-professional services and
(ii) respiratory therapy. The Company's U.K. Operations' products and services
are provided to patients throughout the U.K.

         During fiscal 2000, the Company derived 72.0% of its revenues from U.K.
Operations, with the following contributions by product line: 82.3% of its U.K.
revenues from patient services, 14.3% from specialty pharmaceutical and medical
supplies and 3.4% from respiratory therapy.


         PATIENT SERVICES.

         The Company offers its U.K. patient services through Allied Medicare
Ltd ("Allied") and Nightingale. Allied and Nightingale are commercially oriented
providers of nursing and care staff services to a broad range of clients,
particularly NHS trusts, nursing homes, private clients and local authority
social services departments. Allied was founded in 1972 as a home nursing
service and has expanded through the establishment and acquisition of branch
offices throughout the U.K. The preferred model for branches in the Allied
network is for a Superintendent Model, where the manager of the branch is self
employed and paid 33% of the gross profit generated by the branch. Under these
arrangements the superintendent is responsible for costs associated with
operating the branch and Allied is responsible for various support services,
including payroll administration and collection of accounts receivable. In a
managed branch all operating costs are the responsibility of Allied. The branch
network has expanded substantially in recent years, through both organic growth
and an on-going nursing and care agency acquisition program. As of September 30,
2000, Allied is represented by 57 superintendent branches and 23 managed
branches in the network, with managed branches being operated where the business
will not easily support superintendent status or where the branch is newly
acquired and has not been fully integrated into the network.

         The Company believes that the demand for most forms of nursing and
other health care services is expected to increase during the next twenty years
as the U.K. population grows older in line with demographic trends.
Consequently, it is anticipated that requirements for temporary nursing services
will increase in the future, benefiting both Allied and Nightingale.

         RESPIRATORY THERAPY.

         The Company offers its U.K. respiratory therapy through the following
Omnicare subsidiaries: (i) Allied Oxycare Ltd ("Oxycare"); and (ii) Medigas Ltd
("Medigas").

         Respiratory Therapy. Medigas and its parent Oxycare service patients
with chronic respiratory diseases either directly at home or via the community
pharmacist. Medigas supplies filled oxygen cylinders to pharmacies for patients
at home who require lower volumes of oxygen per day or who may have temporary
respiratory conditions. These services are offered throughout the U.K. Oxycare
provides oxygen concentrators, which filter room air to provide a 95% oxygen
gas, to patients in their homes.

         The Company offered its U.K. specialty pharmaceutical and medical
supplies through its Omnicare subsidiary, Amcare Ltd ("Amcare"). On November 22,
2000, the Company sold Amcare, for approximately $14,200,000 in cash. The
Company has recorded a charge for impairment of long-lived assets of $2,727,000
in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations, for the year ended
September 30, 2000, to reflect the write-down of the carrying value of goodwill,
originally acquired with the purchase of Amcare, to its fair value. In addition,
the Company has recorded a tax charge of approximately $1,654,000 to reflect the
tax effect of the transaction.

         U.K. QUALITY ASSURANCE; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH LICENSES

         The Company's U.K. Operations maintain quality assurance policies and
procedures and closely monitor operations to provide quality care and services
to patients and health care professionals in the U.K. Where appropriate, the
Company's U.K. Operations operate under license of the U.K. Department of Health
and Medicines Control Agency ("MCA"), adhering to the terms and conditions of
service demanded by such licensing authority.

         The European Quality Standards BS EN ISO 9002 have been awarded to
Oxycare. The awarding authority checks the continued adherence to these
standards on a six month basis with procedure manuals being available for review
at any time.

         U.K. SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES

         The Company's U.K. Operations primarily market their products and
services to health care professionals who act as referral sources to patients.
These health care professionals include medics, nurses, pharmacists,
administrators, the NHS and private health care providers. Other important
targets for promotional activity include patient associations and community
social services organizations. Fundamental to Allied and Nightingale's ability
to obtain and retain referral sources is establishing and maintaining a
reputation for quality service and responsiveness to the needs of referral
sources and their patients and clients.

         Allied markets its nursing agency service via superintendents and their
staff within each of its independent locations. These branch locations are
supported by small teams of sales and marketing professionals based centrally to
coordinate and support the sales activity.

         Nightingale markets its nursing agency service directly to NHS Trust
Hospitals and the independent sector.

         Medigas and Oxycare are marketed directly to the pharmacist for oxygen
cylinders and the NHS Supplies for oxygen concentrator services, by a senior
manager. In addition to primary sales activity, delivery drivers play a key role
as secondary sales staff.

         In general, the sales representatives and managers of the Company's
U.K. Operations market the Company's U.K. products and services through direct
contact with referral sources in the form of meetings, telephone calls and
solicitations. Contact is maintained with these sources to strengthen their
relationships. While representatives strive to develop the strongest provider
relationship possible, referral sources often choose to use several service and
product providers.

         As in many European and U.S. markets, the escalating pressures to
reduce the cost of health care has, for some lines of business (prescribed
products and services, including cylinder oxygen, concentrators and medical
supplies) in the Company's U.K. Operations, resulted in reductions in
reimbursement rates. However, the focus towards offering integrated home health
care can result in an overall cost saving leading to, the Company believes,
substantial sales opportunities for the Company's U.K. Operations.

         U.K. RECRUITING AND TRAINING OF PERSONNEL

         The Company's U.K. Operations recruit, train, provide on-going
education, offer benefits and other programs to its staff appropriate to their
needs and the requirements of the business. Recruiting of staff is conducted
primarily through advertising, direct contact with employment and governmental
organizations and through the use of competitive salary and benefit packages.

         The U.K. health care industry continues to face shortages of certain
qualified personnel. In particular, Allied's nursing business experiences
significant competition in recruiting qualified health care personnel for its
operations. Most of the registered and licensed health care professionals
employed by Allied are also registered with and accept placements from
competitors. Nightingale employs qualified staff from both overseas and the U.K.
Typically between 30 and 50% of Nightingale's staff are sourced from the U.K.
while the majority of overseas staff come from Australia, where the Company has
a branch. The most successful method for recruiting staff is referral, but the
Company regularly advertises in appropriate papers and journals. Recruitment is
managed overseas by a branch manager in Sydney, Australia and by agents in New
Zealand and South Africa. Most of Nightingale's nursing professionals do not
work for other agencies and look to Nightingale as their sole provider of work.

         U.K. THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT

         For the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company's U.K.
Operations received approximately 60.5% and 54.0%, respectively of revenues from
U.K. governmental payors (primarily the NHS). The remaining 39.5% and 46.0%,
respectively of revenues were derived from products and services provided to the
private health care sector and other commercial organizations, such as privately
owned nursing homes.

         In general, reimbursement is received regularly and reliably from all
governmental department payors and this is also the case for most of the
remaining customer base. The Company's U.K. Operations generally collects
payments from all third-party payors within two months after products are
supplied or services are rendered but pays its accounts payable and employees
currently.

         The billing and reimbursement process includes the rendering of
invoices for products and services rendered, as well as prescriptions and other
support documentation for reimbursement of drugs and medical supplies.

         U.K. SUPPLIERS

         The Company's U.K. Operations purchase their equipment and supplies
required in connection with the provision of its services from various approved
suppliers. The Company believes that there are a number of alternative sources
for these items at prices comparable to its current sources.

         U.K. COMPETITION

         The Company believes that there are no major integrated service
providers and few multi-regional or national providers of any individual product
or service in the U.K. The Company also believes that home health care providers
who possess the infrastructure to provide an integrated network of products and
services will have significant growth opportunities.


                                       5
<PAGE>


         The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the U.K.
are: quality of care; breadth of services; reputation and professional
presentation; innovation; and value for services. The Company believes that the
success of its U.K. Operations is dependent on the above factors.

         The Company's U.K. Operations' nursing, medical supplies and
respiratory therapy services compete with local, national and international
companies. The Company's nursing agency business is the second largest in the
U.K.; however, the largest competitor is approximately three times larger in
revenues.

         U.K. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

         The Company's U.K. Operations own no patents. The Company's U.K.
Operations operate under the following trade names: "Transworld Holding (UK)
Ltd," "Allied Medicare Ltd," "Medicare," "Medigas Ltd," "Allied Oxycare Ltd,"
"Omnicare Ltd," "Transworld Healthcare (UK) Ltd," "Allied Medicare Services Ltd"
and "Allied Medical Nursing Services." The Company does not believe that its
business in the U.K. is dependent upon the use of any patent or trademark or
similar property.

         U.K. EMPLOYEES

         As of October 31, 2000, the Company's U.K. Operations employed
approximately 199 full-time employees and 39 part-time employees.

         In addition, the Company's U.K. Operations maintain registers of
approximately 5,000 registered nurses, carers and aides available to staff home
and health service nursing arrangements on a temporary basis. The Company
considers its relationships with its U.K. employees to be satisfactory.

         U.S. OPERATIONS

         During fiscal 2000, the Company derived 28.0% of its revenues from U.S.
operations, with the following contributions by reportable business segments:
59.2% of its U.S. revenues from Mail-Order Operations and 40.8% from Hi-Tech
Operations.

         U.S. SERVICES AND PRODUCTS

         MAIL-ORDER OPERATIONS.

         In September 2000, the Company entered into an agreement, which was
completed on October 3, 2000, to sell a substantial portion of the assets of its
Mail-Order Operations and has decided to exit the business (See Note 3 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

         During fiscal 1999, the remaining accounts receivable associated with
the wound care and orthotic product lines, which the Company previously exited
in fiscal 1997, were reserved for, as the Company became aware of deterioration
in their collectibility. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources."


                                       6

         HI-TECH OPERATIONS.

         The Company's Hi-Tech Operations provide the following services and
products in the U.S.: (i) infusion therapy; (ii) respiratory therapy; and (iii)
home medical equipment. The Company's Hi-Tech Operations are concentrated in New
Jersey and New York. During fiscal 2000, the Company's Hi-Tech Operations
derived 74.8% of its revenues from infusion therapy, 19.8% from respiratory
therapy and 5.4% from home medical equipment.

         Infusion Therapy. Infusion therapy involves the intravenous
administration of antibiotics, nutrients or other medications to patients in
their homes usually as a continuation of treatment initiated in the hospital.
The Company's related support services include patient training in the
self-administration of infusion therapies, nursing support, pharmacy operations
and related delivery services and insurance reimbursement assistance. The
Company offers these therapies and services to patients in the New York
metropolitan area and in New Jersey from its facility located in Clark, New
Jersey.

         Respiratory Therapy. The Company provides home respiratory services to
patients with a variety of conditions, primarily chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (e.g., emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma). The Company employs a
clinical staff of respiratory care professionals to provide support to its home
respiratory therapy patients. These professionals manage the needs of the
Company's patients according to physician-directed plans of care. The Company's
respiratory therapy revenues are derived primarily from the provision of oxygen
systems, nebulizers (devices to aerosolize medication), home ventilators and
respiratory medication on a unit dose basis. The Company offers its respiratory
therapy services principally in New Jersey and the New York metropolitan area.

         Home Medical Equipment. The Company's U.S. product offerings in home
medical equipment consist of patient room equipment (such as hospital beds,
patient lifts and commodes), ambulatory aids (such as walkers and canes) and
bathroom safety items. The Company generally purchases this equipment from
manufacturers and rents it to patients. Accordingly, the Company generally
promotes its home medical equipment and services business as a complementary
product line in each of the markets where it also provides respiratory therapy
and infusion therapy.

         U.S. QUALITY ASSURANCE; JCAHO ACCREDITATIONS

         The Company maintains quality assurance policies and procedures and
closely monitors operations in order to provide high quality care with respect
to the services it offers. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations ("JCAHO"), a not-for-profit private organization that has
established standards for health care organizations, has granted accreditation
status to all of the Company's Hi-Tech Operations. The Company believes that
accreditations of its eligible facilities by JCAHO is a prerequisite for
entering into contracts with managed care providers and other intermediaries and
for obtaining and maintaining required licensure or certification.

         U.S. SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES

         The Company primarily markets its services and products to referral
sources such as physicians, hospital discharge planners and social service
workers, insurance companies, prepaid health plans, health maintenance
organizations ("HMOs"), county medical services and private charitable
organizations. Fundamental to the Company's ability to obtain and retain
referral sources is establishing and maintaining a reputation for quality
service and responsiveness to the requirements of the referral sources.

         The Company currently employs full-time sales representatives for its
Hi-Tech Operations. The Company uses primarily the same sales force to
cross-market its products and services.



                                       7
<PAGE>

         In general, the sales representatives market the Company's services
through direct contact with referral sources in the form of meetings, telephone
calls and sales presentations. The representatives maintain contact with these
sources in order to strengthen their relationships. While the sales
representatives strive to develop exclusive provider relationships, referral
sources frequently utilize the services of several home health care companies.
The sales representatives are trained by the Company to provide information to
referral sources concerning the quality and convenience of the Company's home
health care services and the potential cost-saving advantages of such services.
Primarily due to escalating pressures to contain health care costs, third-party
payors are participating to a greater extent in decisions regarding health care
alternatives and are consequently becoming more important in the referral and
case management process.

         U.S. THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT

         Substantially all of the Company's U.S. revenues are attributable to
third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurers, managed
care plans and HMOs. The amounts received from government programs and private
third-party payors are dependent upon the specific benefits included under the
program or the patient's insurance policies. Like other medical service
providers, the Company is subject to lengthy reimbursement delays as a result of
third-party payment procedures. The Company generally collects payments from
third-party payors within three months after products are supplied or services
are rendered, but pays its accounts payable and employees currently.

         The billing and reimbursement process involves the collection, review
and approval of a significant number of required documents. Certain payors such
as Medicare, Medicaid and managed care plans require very specific procedures
and documentation prior to approving any request for reimbursement.
Reimbursement specialists of the Company work together to assess patient
coverage, review the adequacy of documentation, submit documentation and claims
to the third-party payors and expedite payment. The Company accepts assignment
of insurance benefits from the patient, and in most instances the third-party
payors pay the Company directly.

         For the year ended September 30, 2000, 52.6% and 12.1%, respectively,
of the Company's U.S. revenues were directly attributable to the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. For the year ended September 30, 1999, 64.5% and 6.9%,
respectively, of the Company's U.S. revenues were directly attributable to the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. The decrease in the percentage of revenues
directly attributable to Medicare during the year ended September 30, 2000
versus 1999 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenues in the Company's
Mail-Order Operations, which derives most of its revenues from Medicare.

         U.S. SUPPLIERS

         The Company purchases its equipment and supplies, including drugs, home
medical equipment, nutritional solutions and other materials required in
connection with its therapies and specialty mail-order pharmacy and medical
supplies operations, from various suppliers. The Company believes that there are
a number of available sources of supply for the Company's products.

         U.S. COMPETITION

         The home health care market is highly fragmented and consists of
numerous providers, relatively few of which are national or regional in scope.
The Company competes with a large number of companies, including numerous local,
regional and national companies, in all areas in which it conducts business. The
Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the U.S. are quality
of care, including responsiveness of services and quality of professional
personnel; breadth of services offered; referrals from physicians, hospitals and
HMOs; general reputation with physicians, other referral sources and potential
patients; and for certain payors, price.


                                       8

         U.S. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

         The Company owns no patents in the U.S. The Company owns the following
service marks in the U.S.: "Steri-Pharm," "Transworld Nurses, Inc.," "Advocate
Home Care," "PLANETWELLNESS" and "Respiflow." The Company does not believe that
its business is dependent upon the use of any patent or trademark or similar
property.

         U.S. EMPLOYEES

         As of October 31, 2000, the Company had approximately 162 full-time
employees and approximately 23 part-time employees in the U.S. The Company
considers its relationship with its U.S. employees to be satisfactory.

         GOVERNMENT REGULATION

         U.K. GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

         General. The Company's U.K. Operations are subject to regulations by
the government of the U.K. via acts of Parliament related to health care
provision. These acts generally fall under the Department of Health and relate
to services provided to the general public under the NHS.

         Approximately 85% of health care in the U.K. is provided under the NHS
with the remaining 15% being provided by private health care organizations.
However, all care provision is regulated under the general health regulations of
the Department of Health.

         Health Care Reform. The NHS has released a green paper "Towards a
Healthier Future" and two white papers, one concerned with community care and
the second with primary care reforms.

         The current Labour government has continued to develop the previous
Tory government's plans of devolving decisions on patient care down to the
family doctor. Primary Care Groups, based on local communities are now in
operation, which will increasingly mean that decisions related to patient care
and the funding required, will be decided by a group representing general
practitioners, nurses, pharmacists and community care workers operating in
conjunction with the District Health Authorities and Local Authorities.

         In addition to this top-level development change, the NHS continues to
seek ways in which it can reduce costs. The Company believes that contractors to
the NHS will continue to come under pressure over the next 5 years, until the
next election, with the current government's determination to fund changes in
the NHS without increasing direct taxation.

         Licenses for Contractors and Suppliers. The Company's U.K. Operations
are subject to licensing and approval regulations from both governmental and
non-governmental bodies according to terms of service and operating procedures
decided by the U.K. government.

         Allied and Nightingale operate under the Nurses Act (England and Wales)
1957 and 1961 Amendment and the Nurses Agency Act (Scotland) 1957. In addition,
Allied is accredited by various U.K. social services agencies for the supply of
carers to the Community Services, within that specific area. The MCA has granted
licenses to Oxycare and Medigas for the production and distribution of medical
grade oxygen to the network of 12,000 pharmacies throughout the U.K.


                                       9
<PAGE>


         Fraud and Abuse. In late 1997, the Prescription Pricing Authority
released a report on "Prescription Fraud in the NHS" and certain recommendations
have been introduced to reduce the level of fraud by patients and contractors to
the NHS since April 1998. New prescription forms have been issued which are more
"secure" for the prescriber while patients have to make signed undertakings that
they are entitled to receive the prescribed drugs. Regarding contractor fraud
with prescriptions, a number of practices were identified and challenged as to
their legality.

         The Company believes that its practices regarding claim for
reimbursement and remuneration are in substantial compliance with applicable law
and it has recently amended, whilst continuing to review its practices in light
of recent recommendations to ensure they are in accordance with governmental
regulations. The Company's U.K. Operations were audited by the licensing health
authorities in June and July of 2000 and confirmation of compliance has been
received.

         The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance in all
material respects with U.K. health care laws and regulations applicable to its
U.K. Operations.

         U.S. GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

         General. The Company's business is subject to extensive Federal and
state regulation. Federal regulation covers, among other things, Medicare and
Medicaid billing and reimbursement, reporting requirements, supplier standards,
limitations on ownership and other financial relationships between a provider
and its referral sources and approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the
safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In addition, the
requirements that the Company must satisfy to conduct its businesses vary from
state to state. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial
compliance with applicable Federal and state laws and regulations in all
material respects. However, changes in the law or new interpretations of
existing laws could have a material effect on permissible activities of the
Company, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of
reimbursement for the Company's products and services paid by government and
other third-party payors.

         Health Care Reform. Political, economic and regulatory influences are
subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. Although
Congress has failed to pass comprehensive health care reform legislation, the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (the "Balanced Budget Act") made several changes to
the Medicare reimbursement system that affect payment for the products provided
by the Company. Some of these provisions include an expansion of coverage of
diabetic testing supplies to non- insulin-treated Medicare diabetics, a 10%
reduction of Medicare payment rates for diabetic testing strips, as of January
1, 1998, a 5% reduction of Medicare payment rates for respiratory drugs, as of
January 1, 1998, a requirement that skilled nursing facilities provide directly
and bundle into their payment certain items, including medical supplies, which
may have been previously provided by outside suppliers, a freeze on the update
factor for durable medical equipment and supplies, and parenteral and enteral
equipment and supplies, a provision regarding billing for upgraded medical
equipment, and authorization for a competitive pricing demonstration program.
Under the Social Security Act's authority to the Health Care Financing
Administration ("HCFA") to alter certain reimbursement rates that are not
inherently reasonable, Medicare is proposing additional inherent reasonableness
cuts to Medicare payment rates as follows: (i) up to a 3.38% (depending on the
state) reduction for diabetic testing strips; (ii) a 15% reduction in Medicare
payment rates for diabetic lancets, and an additional 15% and 2.32% in
subsequent years; and (iii) a 10.5% reduction for albuterol sulfate (a
respiratory drug). On November 29, 1999, President Clinton signed into law the
Medicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, better
known as the Provider Relief Act. The Provider Relief Act provides that HCFA may
not use or permit its contractors to use the inherent reasonableness process
until after: (i) the Comptroller General of the United States issues a report
regarding the impact of HCFA's and/or its contractor's use of such authority;
and (ii) HCFA has published final regulations implementing the agency's inherent
reasonableness authority. Consequently, it is unclear if or when HCFA will be
able to implement any of its previously proposed inherent reasonableness
reductions for diabetic testing strips, diabetic lancets or albuterol sulfate or
any other items and services supplied by the Company to Medicare beneficiaries.


                                       10
<PAGE>


         The Company anticipates that Congress and state legislatures will
continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment
systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation effecting
fundamental changes in the health care delivery system. The Company cannot
predict the ultimate timing, scope or effect of any legislation concerning
health care reform. Any proposed Federal legislation, if adopted, could result
in significant changes in the availability, delivery, pricing and payment for
health care services and products. Various state agencies also have undertaken
or are considering significant health care reform initiatives. Although it is
not possible to predict whether any health care reform legislation will be
adopted or, if adopted, the exact manner and the extent to which the Company
will be affected, it is likely that the Company will be affected in some
fashion, and there can be no assurance that any health care reform legislation,
if and when adopted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated business, financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

         Permits and Licensure. Certain of the Company's facilities are subject
to state licensure laws, including licensing from state boards of pharmacy.
Federal laws require certain of the Company's facilities to comply with rules
applicable to controlled substances. These rules include an obligation to
register with the Drug Enforcement Administration of the United States
Department of Justice and to meet certain requirements concerning security,
record keeping, inventory controls, prescription and order forms and labeling.
The Company's pharmacists and nurses also are subject to state licensing
requirements. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all
applicable licensure requirements.

         Fraud and Abuse Laws. The Company is subject to Federal and state laws
prohibiting direct or indirect payments for patient referrals for items and
services reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid and state programs, as well as in
relation to private payors. The Company also is subject to Federal and state
laws governing certain financial relationships with physicians and other fraud
and abuse laws prohibiting the submission of false claims.

         The Federal Medicare and Medicaid "Anti-kickback Statute" prohibits
certain conduct involving improper payments in connection with the delivery of
items or services covered by a number of Federal and state health care programs.
Among other things, these prohibitions apply to anyone who knowingly and
willfully solicits, receives, offers, or pays any remuneration in return for
referring an individual to another person for the furnishing, or arranging for
the furnishing, of any item or service that may be paid, in whole or in part, by
the Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs. To date, courts
have interpreted the Anti-kickback Statute to apply to a broad range of
financial relationships between providers and referral sources, including
physicians and other direct health care providers, as well as persons who do not
have a direct role in the provision of health care services. Violations of the
statute may result in criminal penalties, including fines of up to $25,000 and
imprisonment for up to five years for each violation, exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and civil penalties of up
to $50,000 and treble the amount of remuneration for each violation. The
Balanced Budget Act increases accountability and strengthens program integrity
through additional fraud and abuse penalties.


                                       11
<PAGE>


         The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' ("HHS") Office of
Inspector General ("OIG") has adopted regulations creating "safe harbors" from
Federal criminal and civil penalties under the Anti-kickback Statute by
identifying certain types of ownership interests and other financial
arrangements that do not appear to pose a threat of Medicare and Medicaid
program abuse. Additional safe harbors have also been proposed, and OIG has
recently solicited proposals for developing new and modifying existing safe
harbors. Transactions covered by the Anti-kickback Statute that do not conform
to an applicable safe harbor are not necessarily in violation of the
Anti-kickback Statute, but such arrangements would risk scrutiny and may be
subject to civil sanctions or criminal enforcement action.

         The Federal self-referral or "Stark Law" provides that where a
physician has a "financial relationship" with a provider of "designated health
services" (including, among other things, parenteral and enteral nutrients,
equipment and supplies, outpatient prescription drugs and home medical
equipment, which are products and services provided by the Company), the
physician is prohibited from referring a Medicare patient to the health care
provider, and that provider is prohibited from billing Medicare, for the
designated health service. The Stark Law has certain statutory exceptions. In
August 1995, regulations were issued pursuant to the Stark Law as it existed
prior to significant amendments enacted in 1993. The preamble to these
regulations states that HCFA intends to rely on the language and interpretations
in the regulations when reviewing compliance under the Stark Law, as amended
(the "Amended Stark Law"). Certain exceptions from the referral prohibitions are
available under the Amended Stark Law. Submission of a claim that a provider
knows or should know is for services for which payment is prohibited under the
Amended Stark Law, and which does not meet an exception could result in refunds
of any amounts billed, civil money penalties of not more than $15,000 for each
such service billed, and possible exclusion from the Medicare program. In
addition a state cannot receive Federal financial participation payments under
the Medicaid program for designated health services furnished to an individual
on the basis of a physician referral that would result in a denial of payment
under Medicare if Medicare covered the services to the same extent as under a
state Medicaid plan.

         A number of Federal laws impose civil and criminal liability for
knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim, or
knowingly making a false statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the
government. Under one such law, the "False Claims Act," civil damages may
include an amount that is three times the amount of claims falsely made or the
government's actual damages, and up to $10,000 per false claim. In addition, a
civil penalty of up to $15,000 may be assessed for engaging in other activities
prohibited by this statute. Actions to enforce the False Claims Act may be
commenced by a private citizen on behalf of the Federal government, and such
private citizens receive between 15 and 30 percent of the recovery, as further
described below - see letter received from the HHS' Office of Audit Services.
Recent government efforts have been made (with mixed success) to assert that any
claim resulting from a relationship in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute or
the Amended Stark Law is false or fraudulent under the False Claims Act. The
Company carefully monitors its submissions of Medicare and Medicaid claims and
all other claims for reimbursement to assure that they are not false or
fraudulent, and as noted above, believes that it is in substantial compliance
with the Anti-kickback Statute or the Amended Stark Law.

         The OIG of HHS instituted "Operation Restore Trust" in May 1995 in the
five states with the highest Medicare expenditures (California, Florida, New
York, Texas and Illinois). Operation Restore Trust is intended to counter health
care fraud, waste and abuse in targeted areas that HHS believes to be
particularly vulnerable to fraud and abuse, including home health care, nursing
homes and home medical equipment. The OIG also has issued "Fraud Alerts"
relating to improper business practices in the provision of medical supplies to
nursing homes, and is expected to issue additional Fraud Alerts in the future as
a means of advising the public of suspect business arrangements and practices in
the health care industry. In addition, providers of home medical equipment,
wound care supplies and other products and services are expected to be subject
to increased scrutiny for practices involving fraud and abuse.


                                       12
<PAGE>


         Many states, including the states in which the Company operates, have
adopted statutes and regulations prohibiting payments for patient referrals and
other types of financial arrangements with health care providers, which, while
similar in certain respects to the Federal legislation, vary from state to
state. Sanctions for violating these state restrictions may include loss of
licensure and civil and criminal penalties. Certain states also have begun
requiring health care practitioners and/or other providers to disclose to
patients any financial relationship with a provider, including advising patients
of the availability of alternative providers.

         The Company continues to review all aspects of its operations and
believes that it is in substantial compliance with all material respects with
applicable provisions of the Anti-kickback Statute, the Amended Stark Law, False
Claims and applicable state laws, although because of the broad and sometimes
vague nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that an enforcement action
will not be brought against the Company or that the Company will not be found to
be in violation of one or more of these provisions. The Company intends to
monitor developments under these Federal and state fraud and abuse laws. At this
time, the Company cannot anticipate what impact, if any, subsequent
administrative or judicial interpretation of the applicable Federal and state
fraud and abuse laws may have on the Company's consolidated business, financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.

         On July 11 and July 22, 1997, the Company's RespiFlow, Inc.
("RespiFlow") and MK Diabetic Support Services, Inc. ("MK") subsidiaries,
respectively, each received a letter (the "Audit Letters") from the HHS' Office
of Audit Services, a division of the OIG. The Company was subsequently informed
that the Audit Letters cover its DermaQuest, Inc. ("DermaQuest") subsidiary. The
Company has produced certain documents and provided related information to the
OIG and to the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas regarding these
subsidiaries' financial relationships with suppliers of durable medical
equipment and various other practices including the subsidiaries' practices
regarding the collection of coinsurance and deductible amounts due from Medicare
beneficiaries. Additionally, on November 19, 1997, the Company was notified by
the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas that the Company, RespiFlow,
MK, and various other non-affiliated entities had been named defendants in a qui
tam action under the Federal False Claims Act. The relator is a private party
who has brought action on behalf of the Federal government. The Company entered
into settlement discussions with the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and OIG in an
effort to bring closure to this matter and to avoid the expense, disruption and
uncertainty of litigation. Counsel for the relator was involved in these
settlement discussions as well. On August 4, 2000, a final settlement was
reached with the DOJ, the OIG and the relator in the amount of $10,000,000. In
addition, pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company paid the relator
$82,000 covering reasonable expenses and attorney's fees and costs. In return,
the United States has agreed to release the Company, certain subsidiaries, as
well as its present and former owners, officers, directors, employees, and
certain others, from any civil or administrative monetary claim for the various
allegations being settled in this matter. In addition, the OIG has agreed not to
exclude the Company or any of its subsidiaries from future participation in any
federal health care program as a result of this matter.

         In addition to its settlement with the federal government, the Company
also has reached a final settlement with the prior owners of Respiflow, MK and
related subsidiaries (the "Prior Owners") in connection with an ongoing dispute
with such persons. The Prior Owners paid the Company $5,000,000 to settle all
outstanding issues between the relevant parties. In a related agreement the
Company has guaranteed the Prior Owners a price of $5.00 per share for all
shares of Company common stock they currently own (190,000) and still own on
August 4, 2002. The Prior Owners are obligated to liquidate these shares on the
open market for $5.00 per share or greater. To the extent the shares remain
unliquidated on August 4, 2002, the difference between the closing price of the
Company's common stock on August 4, 2002 and $5.00 per share will be paid to the
Prior Owners by the Company in cash.


                                       13
<PAGE>


         The Company recorded a one-time charge of $5,082,000 related to the
settlement of all of these matters in its third quarter of fiscal 2000.

         Contemporaneously with the government settlement, the Company entered
into a Corporate Integrity Agreement ("CIA") with the OIG to ensure compliance
with existing federal health programs. The CIA requires the Company to, among
other things, appoint a compliance officer and compliance committee, develop and
implement a written code of conduct and policies and procedures, perform
prospective and retrospective reviews of claims submitted to the Medicare
program. In addition, the CIA requires periodic written reporting to the OIG
summarizing the status and findings of the Company's compliance activities. The
CIA, which does not apply to the Company's U.S. Hi-Tech Operations, has a term
of five years.

         INSURANCE

         Participants in both the U.K. and U.S. health care markets are subject
to lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability or other similar legal
theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs. The
Company, from time to time, is subject to such suits as a result of the nature
of its business. The Company maintains general liability insurance, professional
liability insurance and excess liability coverage, as appropriate. Each of these
policies provides coverage on an " occurrence" basis and has certain exclusions
from coverage. The Company's insurance policies must be renewed annually. While
the Company has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such
insurance varies in cost, is difficult to obtain and may not be available in the
future on terms acceptable to the Company, if it is available at all. The
failure to maintain insurance coverage or a successful claim not covered by or
in excess of the Company's insurance coverage could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's business, financial position, cash flows or results of
operations. In addition, claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome,
may have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation. There can be no
assurance that the Company's insurance will be sufficient to cover liabilities
that it may incur in the future.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

         The Company owns three and leases fifty-nine facilities in the U.K. (of
which twenty-one are for a period of three months or less) and leases a total of
six facilities in the U.S. In addition, there are thirty-four facilities in the
U.K. which are owned or leased by branch representatives. Management believes
that its existing leases will be renegotiated as they expire or that alternative
properties can be leased on acceptable terms. The Company also believes that its
present facilities are well maintained and are suitable for it to continue its
existing operations. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.


         THE COMPANY

         On August 20, 1999, Transworld Home Healthcare - Nursing Division, Inc.
("TNI") was named a defendant in a suit brought by Teresa Crutcher, in New
Jersey state court, as administrator of the estate of Aaron Pernell, who was an
infant and Teresa Crutcher's son. The claim is for wrongful death of Aaron
Pernell alleged to have been caused by the negligent manner in which a TNI home
care nurse placed him in an infant car seat. The case was settled on December
27, 1999 for $325,000 and was paid on December 29, 1999 by the Company's
insurance carrier. Since this settlement was within the policy limits of the
Company's insurance policies, it did not have any effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.



                                       14
<PAGE>


         On April 13, 1998, a shareholder of the Company, purporting to sue
derivatively on behalf of the Company, commenced a derivative suit in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, entitled Kevin Mak,
derivatively and on behalf of Transworld Healthcare, Inc., Plaintiff, vs.
Timothy Aitken, Scott A. Shay, Lewis S. Ranieri, Wayne Palladino and Hyperion
Partners II L.P., Defendants, and Transworld Healthcare, Inc., Nominal
Defendant, Index No. 98-106401. The suit alleges that certain officers and
directors of the Company, and Hyperion Partners II L.P. ("HPII"), breached
fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders, in connection with a
transaction, approved by a vote of the Company's shareholders on March 17, 1998,
in which the Company was to issue certain shares of stock to HPII in exchange
for certain trade receivables due from Health Management, Inc. ("HMI") purchased
by HPII from unrelated third parties. The action seeks injunctive relief against
this transaction, damages and costs and attorneys' fees in unspecified amounts.
The transaction subsequently closed and the plaintiff has, on numerous
occasions, stipulated to extend the defendants' time to respond to this suit.
The most recent stipulation provides for an extension to January 12, 2001.

         HMI

         Effective October 1, 1997, the Company owned 100% of the stock of HMI.

         On July 2, 1998, a former shareholder of HMI purporting to sue on
behalf of a class of shareholders of HMI as of June 6, 1997, commenced a suit in
the Delaware Chancery Court, New Castle County, entitled Kathleen S. O'Reilly v.
Transworld HealthCare, Inc., W. James Nicol, Andre C. Dimitriadis, Dr. Timothy
J. Triche and D. Mark Weinberg, Civil Action No. 16507-NC. Plaintiff alleged
that the Company, as majority shareholder of HMI, and the then directors of HMI,
breached fiduciary duties to the minority shareholders of HMI by approving a
merger between HMI and a subsidiary of the Company for inadequate consideration.
Plaintiff demands an accounting, damages, attorney's fees and other payment for
other expenses for unspecified amounts. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss
this action on September 18, 1998. The Court denied defendants' motion in part
and granted the motion in part, leaving intact certain claims. Plaintiff has
propounded discovery requests. The Company's insurer disclaims coverage as to
the Company, however, the insurer for the Company's HMI subsidiary has accepted
coverage for the individual defendant former HMI directors. The Company believes
that it does not have liability and will vigorously defend this action. As such,
the Company cannot predict whether the outcome of these actions will have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash
flows or results of operations.

         By letter dated December 20, 1999, the Company received formal written
notification of the intent of two plaintiffs to file a civil action in the Court
of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania against Transworld Healthcare,
Inc., Transworld Home Healthcare, Inc., Health Management, Inc. and HMI
Pennsylvania, Inc. The two plaintiffs, Irwin Hirsch and Lloyd Myers, formerly
were employees of HMI Pennsylvania, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, and had
written employment agreements. Myers also served as an officer of HMI. Based
upon their former status as employees and as officers, both claim entitlement to
contractual indemnification from HMI and HMI Pennsylvania, Inc. for defense
costs and settlement of certain claims made against them. In 1994, Hirsch and
Myers also sold two retail pharmacies they owned to HMI.

         Hirsch and Myers were named as defendants in an action filed in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York entitled In re
Health Management, Inc. Securities Litigation, Master File No. 96 Civ. 0889
(ADS), which was a class action by shareholders of HMI alleging, among other
claims against the defendants, fraud in connection with the valuation of certain
securities. Hirsch and Myers incurred non-reimbursed legal expenses of $100,000
in defending that litigation and, ultimately, settled their liability jointly
for $1,325,000, which was non-reimbursed. They demand that defendants reimburse
to them their non-reimbursed legal fees and the settlement amount pursuant to
the indemnification provisions of their employee contracts.

         In addition to their indemnification claims, Hirsch and Myers also
claim damages in the amount of $7,000,000 for losses in connection with the
pharmacies sale transaction they entered into with HMI under which they sold
their retail pharmacies to HMI. Hirsch and Myers claim that the pharmacies sale
transaction was based upon fraudulent misrepresentations by HMI.




                                       15
<PAGE>



         The Company and HMI entities will vigorously defend against these
claims. The Company believes that Hirsch and Myers' indemnification claims
should not have any real merit because of testimony given by Hirsch and Myers
under oath in connection with a criminal trial against Clifford Hotte, a
director and former officer of HMI. In their testimony, Hirsch and Myers
acknowledged malfeasance and nonfeasance, which should render their contractual
entitlement to indemnification void. Even if they are entitled to
indemnification despite their acknowledgements, they are liable to defendants
for the economic losses and damages suffered by defendants as a result of the
malfeasance and nonfeasance. Therefore if the civil actions are filed, the
Company and HMI entities will aggressively pursue counterclaims against Hirsch
and Myers for damages which, conservatively, are far in excess of their claims,
including the claims associated with the pharmacies sale transaction.

         The enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") has issued a formal order of investigation relating to matters
arising out of HMI's public announcement on February 27, 1996 that HMI would
have to restate its financial statements for prior periods as a result of
certain accounting irregularities. HMI is fully cooperating with this
investigation and has responded to the requests of the Commission for
documentary evidence.

         The outcomes of certain of the foregoing lawsuits and the investigation
with respect to HMI are uncertain and the ultimate outcomes could have a
material adverse affect on the Company.

         The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings and claims
incidental to its normal business activities. The Company is vigorously
defending its position in all such proceedings. Management believes these
matters should not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial
position, cash flows, or results of operations of the Company.

         As of November 27, 2000, there were approximately 161 stockholders of
record of the Common Stock.

         The Company has neither declared nor paid any dividends on its Common
Stock and does not anticipate paying dividends in respect of its Common Stock in
the foreseeable future. Any payment of future dividends will be at the
discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other
things, the Company's earnings, financial position, cash flows, capital
requirements and other relevant considerations, including the extent of its
indebtedness and any contractual restrictions with respect to the payment of
dividends. Under the terms of the Company's former senior secured revolving
credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), the Company was prohibited from paying
dividends or making other cash distributions. Under the terms of the Refinancing
(as defined and described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources"), the
Company's U.K. subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends or making other
cash distributions. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources." See also

(1)  Effective with the Refinancing, the Company began accounting for the
     investment in the UK Parent and its subsidiaries under the equity method,
     retroactive to October 1, 1999. During the second quarter of fiscal 2000,
     UK Parent and TW UK amended their Articles of Association. The amendments
     enabled the Company to consolidate the UK Parent and its subsidiaries as of
     January 1, 2000.

(2)  The Company changed its fiscal year from October 31 to September 30

     128, "Earnings per Share"("EPS"). SFAS No. 128 replaced primary EPS with
     basic EPS and fully diluted EPS with diluted EPS. The effects of this
     restatement were to increase basic from primary income per share before
     extraordinary item by $0.03 and diluted from fully diluted income per share
     before extraordinary item by $0.01 for the year ended October 31, 1996.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS.

         GENERAL

         The Company is a provider of a broad range of health care services and
products with operations in the U.K. and the U.S. The Company provides the
following services and products: (i) patient services, including nursing and
para-professional services; (ii) respiratory therapy and home medical equipment;
and (iii) infusion therapy. The Company provides these services and products
from the following reportable business segments: (i) U.K. Operations; and (ii)
U.S. Hi-Tech Operations. The Company's U.K. Operations include the U.K.'s second
largest commercial provider of nursing and para-professional care to the
community and U.K. healthcare institutions, the U.K.'s second largest home
respiratory supplier as well as a leading value-added medical supplies
distributor, all with operations located throughout the U.K. The Company's
Hi-Tech Operations are concentrated in New Jersey and New York.

         The Company was a provider of specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals and
medical supplies. The Company provided these services from the reportable
business segment of its U.S. Mail-Order Operations, through the year ended
September 30, 2000, to patients in their home nationwide and in Puerto Rico. In
September 2000, the Company entered into an agreement, which was completed on
October 3, 2000, to sell a substantial portion of the assets of its U.S.
Mail-Order Operations (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements).

         On December 20, 1999, the Company's U.K. subsidiaries obtained new
financing. As a result of the provisions of the Voting Trust (as defined and
described in Liquidity and Capital Resources) the Company did not hold a
majority interest of the board of directors. The Investors (as defined and
described in Liquidity and Capital Resources) held substantive rights,
principally in the form of their ability to approve the annual budget and
financial forecast of results of operations and sources and uses of cash.
Therefore, the Company was no longer able to consolidate the U.K. subsidiaries
into its financial statements although it owned 100% of the outstanding shares
of the stock of the parent company, UK Parent, as of December 31, 1999.
Therefore, effective with the Refinancing, the Company began accounting for the
investment in UK Parent and its subsidiaries under the equity method,
retroactive to October 1, 1999. During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, UK
Parent and TW UK amended their Articles of Association to give the Chairman (a
Company designee) the right to resolve any tie votes of the board of directors
and certain documents covering the Notes (as defined and described in Liquidity
and Capital Resources) were amended to eliminate the requirement that the
Investors approve the operating budget. These amendments have enabled the
Company to consolidate the U.K. subsidiaries as of January 1, 2000.

         The Company's revenue mix and payor mix is influenced to a significant
degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective
payor profiles. The following table shows the percentage of historical net
revenues represented by each of the Company's product lines:

<PAGE>


         The increase in net patient services as a percentage of total revenues
for the year ended September 30, 2000 as compared to 1999 is primarily due to
the acquisition of Nightingale and growth in Allied's branch network (both
organically and through the on-going nursing and care agency acquisition
program). The decrease in net respiratory medical equipment and supplies sales
as a percentage of revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000 as compared to
1999 is due primarily to a decrease in revenues in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order
Operations due principally to a reduction in the number of patients serviced. On
a pro forma basis, assuming the U.K. Subsidiaries had been consolidated for the
entire year ended September 30, 2000, the percentage of total revenues would
have been as follows: net patient services 62.3%, net respiratory, medical
equipment and supplies sales 30.7% and net infusion services 7.0%.

         The following table shows the historical payor mix for the Company's
total revenues for the periods presented:

</TABLE>



         The increase in U.K. NHS and other U.K. governmental payors as a
percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000 as compared
to 1999 is primarily due to the acquisition of Nightingale, which derives the
majority of its revenues from the NHS, and to the growth in Allied's branch
network, as described above. The decrease in Medicare as a percentage of total
revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000 as compared to 1999 is primarily
due to the decrease in revenue in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations. The
Company believes that its payor mix in the future will be determined primarily
by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and to a lessor extent, from
shifts in existing business among payors.

         The increase in U.K. NHS and other U.K. governmental payors and private
payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999
as compared to 1998 is primarily due to the growth in Allied's branch network,
as described above. The decrease in Medicare and Medicaid as a percentage of
total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999 as compared to 1998 is
primarily due to the decrease in revenues in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order and
Hi-Tech Operations, as described above.

         The Company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived
from private payors in the U.S. was subject to case management and managed care
and that this relationship will continue in the future. The Company maintains a
diversified offering of home services and products in an attempt to mitigate the
impact of potential reimbursement reductions for any individual product or
service.

         The Company's gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of
its product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates. The Company
historically has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail-order
and medical supplies pharmacy and respiratory therapy operations than from its
nursing and infusion therapy operations. Subsequent acquisitions, when
completed, will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall
gross margin.


                                       21
<PAGE>


         At September 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company had $90,786,000 and
$103,248,000, respectively of intangible assets (primarily goodwill) on its
balance sheet. This represented 49.4% of total assets and 144.0% of total
stockholders' equity at September 30, 2000 and 60.0% of total assets and 113.1%
of total stockholders' equity at September 30, 1999. Amortization of intangibles
for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $3,301,000, $3,459,000
and $3,147,000, respectively. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will
continue to increase the amount of intangible assets on the balance sheet and
future amortization expense. On a pro forma basis, assuming the U.K.
subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended September 30, 2000,
amortization of intangibles would have been $4,065,000.

         The Company amortizes goodwill over periods ranging from ten to forty
years based on the likely period of time over which related economic benefits
will be realized. The Company believes its estimated goodwill life is reasonable
given, among other factors, the continuing movement of patient care to
non-institutional settings, expanding demand due to demographic trends, the
emphasis of the Company on establishing coverage in each of its local and
regional markets and the consistent practice of other home health care
companies. At each balance sheet date, or if a significant adverse change occurs
in the Company's business, management assesses the carrying amount of enterprise
goodwill. The Company measures impairment of goodwill by comparing the future
undiscounted cash flows (without interest) to the carrying amount of goodwill.
This evaluation is done at the reportable business segment level (primarily by
subsidiary). If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the future cash flows,
the excess carrying amount of goodwill is written off. The factors considered by
management in estimating future cash flows include current operating results,
the effects of any current or proposed changes in third-party reimbursement or
other governmental regulations, trends and prospects of acquired businesses, as
well as the effect of demand, competition, market and other economic factors. If
permanent impairment of goodwill were to be recognized in a future period, it
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.


         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 VS. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999

         Revenues. Total reported revenues for the years ended September 30,
2000 and 1999 were $135,408,000 and $154,728,000, respectively. This represents
a decrease of $19,320,000 or 12.5%. This decrease relates primarily to the
change in accounting for the U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity
method during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 ($24,489,000) and declines in
revenue experienced by the Mail-Order Operations ($14,554,000) due to a
reduction in the number of patients serviced. Partly offsetting these decreases
were increased revenues in the Company's U.K. nursing operations, subsequent to
January 1, 2000, ($17,945,000) as a result of acquisitions (including
$10,325,000 from Nightingale) and an increase in the billable hours. The Hi-Tech
Operations also experienced an increase in revenues ($2,336,000) primarily due
to an increase in the number of patients being serviced.

         Cost of Revenues. Total reported cost of revenues for the years ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999 was $89,781,000 and $99,410,000, respectively. As a
percentage of total revenue, cost of revenues for the year ended September 30,
2000 increased to 66.3% in comparison to 64.2% for the year ended September 30,
1999. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased slightly for
patient services (69.0% for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 68.1% for
the year ended September 30, 1999) and for respiratory, medical equipment and
supplies sales (59.7% for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 57.7% for the
year ended September 30, 1999) and decreased for infusion services (72.4% for
the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 76.9% for the year ended September 30,
1999). The increase in patient services costs is primarily due to the
acquisition of Nightingale, which has a higher cost of revenue (82.0%) than the
historical U.K. nursing operations (67.1%). The increase in respiratory, medical
equipment and supplies sales costs is principally attributable to higher
delivery costs in the U.K. Operations. The decrease in infusion services costs
is due to an increase in volume of higher gross margin infusion therapies in the
Hi-Tech Operations.

                                       22
<PAGE>

         Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Reported selling, general
and administrative expenses for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 were
$49,041,000 and $57,946,000, respectively. This represents a decrease in the
current year of $8,905,000 or 15.4%. The change in accounting for the U.K.
subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of
fiscal 2000 accounted for $5,070,000 of the decrease. The recording of
additional bad debt expense of $3,655,000 (principally as a result of fully
reserving for DermaQuest's accounts receivable) and $2,030,000 of charges
primarily related to the attempted acquisitions of Sinclair Montrose Healthcare
("Sinclair") and Gateway Homecare, Inc. ("Gateway") and additional legal costs
during the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999 added to the decrease. In
addition, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in the
Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations due to an overhead reduction program
($2,165,000). Overhead costs in the Company's U.S. Corporate offices also
decreased ($537,000) principally due to headcount reductions. These decreases
were offset by higher levels of overhead in the U.K. operations, subsequent to
January 1, 2000, principally due to its acquisitions ($3,170,000). These
decreases were also offset by the net increase in bad debt expense in the
Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations as a result of valuing accounts receivable
to net realizable value ($3,180,000) which was offset by declines in revenue
resulting in reduced bad debt charges ($1,697,000).

         Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. For the year ended September 30, 2000,
the Company recorded a $15,073,000 charge related to the write-down of assets to
their fair value for the U.S. Mail-Order Operations and Amcare (see Notes 3 and
16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

         Legal Settlements, Net. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the
Company recorded a one-time charge of $10,082,000 related to a settlement with
the federal government which was offset by a $5,000,000 settlement with the
Prior Owners (see "Business - Government Regulation").

         Restructuring Charge. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the
Company recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge related to exiting and
closing its U.S. Mail-Order Operations (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

         Interest Income. Reported interest income for the years ended September
30, 2000 and 1999 was $1,443,000 and $227,000, respectively. The increase was
attributable to higher interest income earned ($1,276,000) on a higher level of
funds invested partially offset by the change in accounting for the U.K.
subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first quarter of
fiscal 2000 ($60,000).

         Interest Expense. Reported interest expense for the years ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999 was $9,382,000 and $5,445,000, respectively. The
increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of borrowings combined
with higher borrowing rates under the Refinancing than the Credit Facility
($4,153,000). This increase was partially offset by the change in accounting for
the U.K. subsidiaries from consolidation to the equity method during the first
quarter of fiscal 2000 ($215,000).

                                       23
<PAGE>

         Benefit for Income Taxes. The Company recorded a benefit for income
taxes amounting to $7,348,000 or 22.4% of loss before income taxes, equity
income, minority interest and extraordinary loss for the year ended September
30, 2000 versus $500,000 or 6.4% of loss for the year ended September 30, 1999.
The difference between the 22.4% effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 and the
statutory tax rate resulted from non-deductible expenses, primarily amortization
of intangible assets, the legal settlements and foreign capital gains tax on the
sale of Amcare.

         Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company
will generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the
$20,961,000 of reported net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit
associated with future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss
carryforwards, prior to their expiration (primarily 12 years or more). This
belief is based upon, among other factors, management's focus on its business
realignment activities and current business strategies primarily with respect to
its U.K. Operations. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of taxable income
might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. If this
were to occur, management is committed to implementing tax planning strategies,
such as the sale of net appreciated assets of the Company to the extent required
(if any) to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these
benefits. Should such strategies be required, they could potentially result in
the sale of a portion of the Company's interest in the U.K. Operations and
repatriation of such proceeds to the U.S.

         Management expects that it is more likely than not that future levels
of income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets, as recorded.
The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be
reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the
carryforward period are reduced.

         Equity in Income of and Interest Income Earned from U.K. Subsidiaries.
Equity in income of U.K. subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2000 was
$411,000, which represents 100% of the net income of the Company's U.K.
subsidiaries for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 (See Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest income earned from U.K.
subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $782,000 (net of tax
provision of $421,000), which represents interest income on an intercompany
loan, which was repaid on December 20, 2000, concurrent with the Refinancing.
There was no equity in income of and interest income earned from U.K.
subsidiaries for the entire year ended September 30, 1999 as the Company
consolidated its U.K. subsidiaries in fiscal 1999.

         Minority Interest. The Company reported a benefit from minority
interest of $70,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000. The minority interest
represents the 1,050,000 shares of class A1 common stock of TW UK issued as part
of the Nightingale consideration (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

         Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. An extraordinary
loss (net of tax benefit of $408,000) of $759,000 was recorded in the year ended
September 30, 2000, as a result of the write-off of deferred financing costs
associated with the early extinguishment of borrowings under the Company's
Credit Facility.

         Net Loss. As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss
of $24,944,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000 compared to $7,346,000 for
the year ended September 30, 1999.


         YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 VS. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998.

         Revenues. Total revenues decreased by $581,000 or .4% to $154,728,000
for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $155,309,000 for the year ended
September 30, 1998. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in
the number of patients serviced by the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations
($9,514,000) and Hi-Tech Operations ($1,666,000) and the incremental impact of
the Balanced Budget Act, which reduced revenue in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order
Operations by $611,000. In addition, the sale of TNI accounted for a decrease of
$7,661,000. These decreases were substantially offset by increases in the
Company's U.K. Operations, specifically, patient services ($18,934,000). The
U.K. Operations increased principally due to continued expansion, increased
billing rates and an increase in the number of patients serviced.

                                       24
<PAGE>

         Pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act, a 10% reduction in Medicare
reimbursement of diabetic testing strips and a 5% reduction in Medicare
reimbursement of respiratory drugs became effective January 1, 1998. These
reductions reduced revenue, increased cost of revenues as a percentage of
revenues and decreased gross profit for respiratory, medical equipment and
supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction (as discussed herein).

         Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $2,218,000 to
$99,410,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $97,192,000 for the year
ended September 30, 1998. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues
for the year ended September 30, 1999 increased to 64.2% in comparison to 62.6%
for the year ended September 30, 1998. Cost of revenues as a percentage of
revenues declined for patient services (68.1% for the year ended September 30,
1999 versus 69.4% for the year ended September 30, 1998), increased for
respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (57.7% for the year ended
September 30, 1999 versus 55.0% for the year ended September 30, 1998) and
increased for infusion services (76.9% for the year ended September 30, 1999
versus 73.4% for the year ended September 30, 1998). The decrease in patient
services is primarily due to increased billing rates. The increase in
respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales is due to an increase in
respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales in the U.S. Mail-Order
Operations with higher product costs. The increase in infusion services is due
to an increase in infusion therapies in the Hi-Tech Operations with higher
product costs.

         Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $5,966,000 or 11.5% to $57,946,000 for the
year ended September 30, 1999 from $51,980,000 for the year ended September 30,
1998. This increase was due to additional bad debt expense ($3,605,000)
principally as a result of fully reserving for DermaQuest's accounts
receivables. In addition, there were higher levels of overhead in the U.K.
Operations ($3,585,000) due to its continued expansion and the U.S. Mail-Order
Operations incurred additional costs for overhead related to sales and
collection efforts in the U.S. operations during the first half of fiscal 1999
($1,942,000). Year ended September 30, 1999 included $1,392,000 of charges
primarily related to the attempted acquisitions of Sinclair and Gateway and
additional legal reserves versus $554,000 of charges included in fiscal 1998
primarily relating to costs incurred from its attempted acquisitions of
Healthcall and Apria. These increases were offset by an overhead reduction
program in the Mail-Order Operations ($2,642,000). The sale of TNI accounted for
an additional decrease of $1,871,000.

         Gain on Sale of Assets. For the year ended September 30, 1998, the
Company recorded a $2,511,000 gain on the TNI Sale.

         Operating (Loss) Income. The Company incurred an operating loss of
$2,628,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 compared to operating income of
$8,648,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998. Excluding the $1,392,000 of
charges related to attempted acquisitions and additional legal reserves and
$3,605,000 of additional bad debt expenses in the year ended September 30, 1999,
the Company would have recorded operating income of $2,369,000.

         Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $408,000 to $227,000 for
the year ended September 30, 1999 from $635,000 for the year ended September 30,
1998. This decrease was attributable to lower interest income earned on a lower
level of funds invested.

                                       25
<PAGE>

         Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $841,000 to $5,445,000
for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $6,286,000 for the year ended
September 30, 1998. This favorable variance was primarily attributable to a
lower level of borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility combined with a
reduced borrowing rate.

         (Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. (Benefit) provision for income
taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was a benefit of 6.4% for
the year ended September 30, 1999 and a provision of 61.5% for the year ended
September 30, 1998. The difference between the 6.4% effective tax rate for
fiscal 1999 and the statutory tax rate resulted from non-deductible expenses,
primarily amortization of intangible assets.

         Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company
will generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the
$11,369,000 net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit associated with
future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards,
prior to their expiration (primarily 13 years or more). This belief is based
upon, among other factors, changes in operations over the last few years,
management's focus on its business realignment activities and current business
strategies primarily with respect to its U.K. Operations. Failure to achieve
sufficient levels of taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the
net deferred tax assets. If this were to occur, management is committed to
implementing tax planning strategies, such as the sale of net appreciated assets
of the Company to the extent required (if any) to generate sufficient taxable
income prior to the expiration of these benefits. Should such strategies be
required, they could potentially result in the sale of a portion of the
Company's interest in the U.K. Operations and repatriation of such proceeds to
the U.S.

         Net Loss (Income). As a result of the foregoing, the Company incurred a
net loss of $7,346,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 compared to net
income of $1,153,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998.

         PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 VS. HISTORICAL YEAR ENDED
SEPTEMBER 30, 1999

         The following comparisons of pro forma year ended September 30, 2000 as
compared to September 30, 1999 present the pro forma statement of operations
data as if the U.K. subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended
September 30, 2000.

         Revenues. Total pro forma revenues for the year ended September 30,
2000 were $164,255,000 as compared to $154,728,000 for the year ended September
30, 1999, which represents an increase of $9,527,000 or 6.2%. This increase was
primarily attributable to increased revenues in the Company's U.K. nursing
operations ($22,132,000) as a result of acquisitions (including $10,325,000 from
Nightingale) and an increase in the number of billable hours. Also contributing
to the increase was increased revenues in the Hi-Tech Operations ($2,336,000).
Partly offsetting the increases from the U.K. and Hi-Tech Operations were
declines in revenue experienced by the Mail-Order Operations ($14,554,000) due
to a reduction in the number of patients serviced.

         Cost of Revenues. Pro forma cost of goods sold for the year ended
September 30, 2000 was $109,635,000 as compared to $99,410,000 for the year
ended September 30, 1999. On a pro forma basis total cost of revenues as a
percentage of revenues increased to 66.7% from 64.2% in the year ended September
30, 2000. On a pro forma basis cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues
increased for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales (61.5% for the
year ended September 30, 2000 versus 57.7% for the year ended September 30,
1999), decreased for infusion services (72.4% for the year ended September 30,
2000 versus 76.9% for the year ended September 30, 1999) and increased slightly
for patient services (68.7% for the year ended September 30, 2000 versus 68.1%
for the year ended September 30, 1999). The increase in respiratory, medical
equipment and supplies sales operations costs is attributable to higher delivery
costs in the U.K. Operations. The decrease in infusion services costs is due to
an increase in volume of higher gross margin infusion therapies in the Hi-Tech
Operations. Patient services costs increased slightly due to the acquisition of
Nightingale, which has a higher cost of revenue (82.0%) than the historical U.K.
nursing operations (67.2%).

                                       26

         Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Pro forma selling,
general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2000 were
$55,592,000 as compared to $57,946,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999,
which represents a decrease of $2,354,000 or 4.1%. This decrease was primarily
due to the recording of additional bad debt expense of $3,655,000 (principally
as a result of fully reserving for DermaQuest's accounts receivable) and
$2,030,000 of charges primarily related to the attempted acquisitions of
Sinclair and Gateway and additional legal costs during the year ended September
30, 1999. In addition, selling, general and administrative expensed decreased in
the Company's Mail-Order Operations due to an overhead reduction program
($2,165,000). Overhead costs in the Company's U.S. Corporate offices also
decreased ($333,000) principally due to headcount reductions. These decreases
were offset by higher levels of overhead in the U.K. Operations principally due
to its acquisitions and internal growth ($4,447,000). These decrease were also
offset by the net increase in bad debt expense in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order
Operations as a result of valuing accounts receivable to net realizable value
($3,180,000) which was offset by declines in revenue resulting in reduced bad
debt charges ($1,697,000).

         Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. For the year ended September 30, 2000,
the Company recorded a $15,073,000 charge related to the write-down of assets to
their fair value for the U.S. Mail-Order Operations and Amcare (see Notes 3 and
16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

         Legal Settlements, Net. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the
Company recorded a one-time charge of $10,082,000 related to a settlement with
the federal government which was offset by a $5,000,000 settlement with the
Prior Owners (see "Business - Government Regulation").

         Restructuring Charge. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the
Company recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge related to exiting and
closing its U.S. Mail-Order Operations (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

         Interest Income. Pro forma interest income for the year ended September
30, 2000 was $1,503,000 as compared to $227,000 for the year ended September 30,
1999, which represents an increase of $1,276,000. This increase was attributable
to higher interest income earned on a higher level of funds invested.

         Interest Expense. Pro forma interest expense for the year ended
September 30, 2000 was $9,598,000 as compared to $5,445,000 for the year ended
September 30, 1999, which represents an increase of $4,153,000. This variance
was primarily attributable to a higher level of borrowings combined with higher
borrowing rates under the Refinancing than the Credit Facility.

         Benefit for Income Taxes. Pro forma benefit for income taxes for the
year ended September 30, 2000 was $6,254,000 or 20.5% of loss before income
taxes, equity income, minority interest and extraordinary loss for the year
ended September 30, 2000 versus $500,000 or 6.4% of loss before income taxes for
the year ended September 30, 1999. The difference between the effective tax rate
for the year ended September 30, 2000 and the statutory tax rate resulted from
non-deductible expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets, the legal
settlements and foreign capital gains tax on the sale of Amcare.

                                       27
<PAGE>


         Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company
will generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the
$20,961,000 of reported net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit
associated with future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss
carryforwards, prior to their expiration (primarily 12 years or more). This
belief is based upon, among other factors, management's focus on its business
realignment activities and current business strategies primarily with respect to
its U.K. Operations. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of taxable income
might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. If this
were to occur, management is committed to implementing tax planning strategies,
such as the sale of net appreciated assets of the Company to the extent required
(if any) to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these
benefits. Should such strategies be required, they could potentially result in
the sale of a portion of the Company's interest in the U.K. Operations and
repatriation of such proceeds to the U.S.

         Management expects that it is more likely than not that future levels
of income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets, as recorded.
The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be
reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the
carryforward period are reduced.

         Minority Interest. On a pro forma basis, the Company still would have
reported a benefit from minority interest of $70,000 in the year ended September
30, 2000. The minority interest represents the 1,050,000 shares of class A1
common stock of TW UK issued as part of the Nightingale consideration (See Note
3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

         Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. On a pro forma
basis, the Company still would have reported an extraordinary loss (net of tax
benefit of $408,000) of $759,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000, as a
result of the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the early
extinguishment of borrowings under the Credit Facility.

         Net Loss. As a result of the foregoing, on a pro forma basis, the
Company still would have reported a net loss of $24,944,000 for the year ended
September 30, 2000 compared to $7,346,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999.

         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         GENERAL.

         Cash requirements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 for
capital expenditures ($1,207,000), payments for acquisitions ($13,687,000),
financing fees and issuance costs ($2,849,000), payments on revolving loan
($5,121,000), payments on long-term debt ($2,187,000), as well as the
$55,755,000 repayment of the Credit Facility were met through funds generated
from net payments received from the U.K. subsidiaries ($67,069,000) (as
discussed further in "Refinancing"), borrowings under the acquisition loan
($5,632,000) and proceeds from notes payable ($2,012,000).

         During the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company generated
$3,258,000 from its operating activities. Cash flow from operating activities,
combined with the use of existing cash, funded a $1,500,000 payment to further
reduce the Company's Credit Facility and the following investing activities:
$3,824,000 for further expansion of the Company's U.K. Operations and $2,642,000
for capital expenditures.

         During the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company received
$22,241,000 from investing activities as follows: $32,328,000 received from the
sale of substantially all of the assets of HMI to Counsel Corporation (the "HMI
Asset Sale") partly offset by $11,122,000 paid to complete the merger with HMI
as well as for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and to
satisfy existing HMI obligations which were retained by the Company; $6,029,000
received from asset sales net of utilization of $3,346,000 for capital
expenditures and $1,648,000 for acquisitions and purchases of other intangibles.
Funds generated by investing activities along with net proceeds of $6,492,000
from the exercise of the Company's warrants were used to reduce the Company's
borrowings under the Credit Facility by $29,100,000 and to fund operating
activities.

                                       28
<PAGE>

         The Company believes it has adequate capital resources to conduct its
operations for the next twelve months. On December 20, 1999, the Company's U.K.
subsidiaries completed a $125,700,000 refinancing which repaid the Company's
existing senior indebtedness of $55,755,000 and provided funds for additional
acquisitions in the U.K., subject to the terms of the refinancing agreements.
See " Business - Strategy" "- and Refinancing."


         ASSETS LIMITED TO USE.

         Represents cash and cash equivalents, advanced under the Refinancing,
available for payment of up to fifty percent of the total consideration payable
in connection with Permitted Acquisitions (as defined in the Senior Credit
Agreement).

         ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

         The Company maintains a cash management program that focuses on the
reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main
operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 2000 and 1999, $23,029,000
(12.5%) and $30,814,000 (17.9%), respectively, of the Company's total assets
consisted of accounts receivable substantially from third-party payors. Such
payors generally require substantial documentation in order to process claims.
The collection time for accounts receivable is typically the longest for
services that relate to new patients or additional services requiring medical
review for existing patients.

         Accounts receivable decreased by $7,785,000 from September 30, 1999 to
September 30, 2000 primarily due to additional reserves in the U.S. Mail-Order
Operation, the effect the weakening dollar has had on the translation of the
U.K. subsidiaries accounts receivable ($2,114,000), improved collections in the
Company's U.K. nursing operations and Hi-Tech Operations, and a decline in the
Mail-Order Operations revenue base. These decreases were partially offset by the
acquisition of Nightingale.

         Management's goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or
less than industry averages, which will tend to mitigate the risk of recurrence
of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in
accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. Days
sales outstanding ("DSOs") is a measure of the average number of days taken by
the Company to collect its accounts receivable, calculated from the date
services are rendered. For the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
the Company's average DSOs were 51, 73 and 72, respectively.

         Amcare and Novacare (UK) Limited (subsidiaries of TW UK), had claims
against Health Authorities to recover outstanding sums which they alleged were
due in respect of services performed as National Health Service dispensing
appliance contractors from their respective licensed premises across England and
Wales.

         It is believed that the dispute arose out of a wider national dispute
between Health Authorities and many dispensing appliance contractors over the
correct interpretation of the statutory-based contractual reimbursement
provisions in the context of modern distribution and dispensing practices.
Amcare and Novacare (UK) Limited have reached commercial settlements of the
various disputes with the Health Authorities. As a result of the settlement
discussions with the Health Authorities the Company has recorded a sales credit
of $859,000 in the year ended September 30, 2000.

         REFINANCING.

         General. As described more fully below, on December 20, 1999, the
Company's U.K. subsidiaries, UK Parent and its subsidiary TW UK obtained new
financing denominated in pounds sterling, which aggregates approximately
$114,178,000 at September 30, 2000. The new financing consists of a $66,562,000
senior collateralized term and revolving credit facility (the "Senior Credit
Facility"), $15,012,000 in mezzanine indebtedness (the "Mezzanine Loan") and
$32,604,000 principal amount of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") (each of
the foregoing are sometimes referred to collectively herein as the
"Refinancing"). Of the $114,178,000 of the net proceeds of the Refinancing,
$55,755,000 was used to repay the Company's existing Credit Facility,
$11,617,000 was provided to the Company for general corporate purposes, with the
balance to be used for acquisitions and working capital in the U.K., subject to
the terms of the documents governing the Refinancing. In connection with the
repayment of the Company's existing Credit Facility, the Company recorded a
non-cash, after-tax, extraordinary charge of approximately $759,000 in its first
quarter of fiscal 2000 relating to the write-off of the deferred financing costs
associated with the Credit Facility.

         Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility consists of a (i)
$40,961,000 term loan A, maturing December 17, 2005, (ii) $18,286,000
acquisition term loan B, maturing December 17, 2006 which may be drawn upon
during the first nine years following closing, and (iii) $7,315,000 revolving
facility, maturing December 17, 2005. Repayment of the loans commenced on July
30, 2000 and continues until final maturity. The loans bear interest at rates
equal to LIBOR plus 2% to 2.75% per annum. As of November 1, 2000, TW UK had
outstanding borrowings of $45,120,000 under the Senior Credit Facility. As of
November 1, 2000, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bore interest at a
rate of 8.10% to 8.85%.

         Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Credit Facility prohibits or
restricts, among other things, the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of
indebtedness, certain fundamental corporate changes, dividends (including
distributions to the Company), the making of specified investments and certain
transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Senior Credit Facility contains
affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of
this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as senior
interest coverage, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, fixed charge coverage and minimum net worth.

         The loans under the Senior Credit Facility are collateralized by, among
other things, a lien on substantially all of TW UK's and its subsidiaries'
assets, a pledge of TW UK's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and
guaranties by TW UK's subsidiaries.

         Mezzanine Loan and Mezzanine Warrants. Mezzanine Loan. The Mezzanine
Loan is a term loan maturing December 17, 2007 and bears interest at the rate of
LIBOR plus 7% per annum, where LIBOR plus 3.5% will be payable in cash, with the
remaining interest being added to the principal amount of the loan. The
Mezzanine Loan contains other terms and conditions substantially similar to
those contained in the Senior Credit Facility. The lenders of the Mezzanine Loan
also received warrants to purchase 2% of the fully diluted ordinary shares of TW
UK. As of November 1, 2000, borrowings under the Mezzanine Loan bore interest at
a rate of 13.1038%.

         Mezzanine Warrants. The warrants issued to the mezzanine lenders (the
"Mezzanine Warrants") are detachable and can be exercised at any time without
condition for an aggregate exercise price of approximately $120,000. The fair
value of the Mezzanine Warrants ($2,319,000) issued to the mezzanine lenders has
been recorded as a discount to the mezzanine loan and is being amortized over
the term of the loan using the interest method.

                                       30

         Senior Subordinated Notes and Warrants. Notes. The Notes consist of
$32,604,000 principal amount of senior subordinated notes of UK Parent purchased
by several institutional investors and certain members of management
(collectively, the "Investors"), plus equity warrants issued by TW UK
concurrently with the sale of the Notes (the "Warrants") exercisable for
ordinary shares of TW UK ("Warrant Shares") representing in the aggregate 27% of
the fully diluted ordinary shares of TW UK. See "Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions - Transactions with Directors and Executive Officers."

         The Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.375% per annum payable
quarterly in cash subject to restrictions contained in the Senior Credit
Facility requiring UK Parent to pay interest in-kind through the issuance of
additional notes ("PIK Notes") for the first 18 months, with payment of interest
in cash thereafter subject to a fixed charge coverage test (provided that
whenever interest cannot be paid in cash, additional PIK Notes shall be issued
as payment in-kind of such interest). As of September 30, 2000, $2,403,000 of
PIK Notes have been recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
Notes mature nine years from issuance.

         UK Parent will not have the right to redeem the Notes and the PIK Notes
except as provided in, and in accordance with the documents governing the
issuance of the Notes and Warrants (herein the "Securities Purchase Documents").
The redemption price of the Notes and the PIK Notes will equal the principal
amount of the Notes and the PIK Notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest on
each.

         The Investors have the right, at their option, to require UK Parent to
redeem all or any portion of the Notes and the PIK Notes under certain
circumstances and in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase
Documents. The redemption price of the Notes and the PIK Notes shall be equal to
the principal amount of the Notes and the PIK Notes, plus all accrued and unpaid
interest on each.

         UK Parent's redemption obligation of the Notes and the PIK Notes is
guaranteed by TW UK, which guarantee is subordinated to the existing senior
indebtedness of TW UK to the same extent as the Notes and the PIK Notes are
subordinated to senior indebtedness of UK Parent. If UK Parent fails to perform
in full its obligations following exercise of the Investors put of Notes and TW
UK fails to perform its obligations as a guarantor of such obligations, the
Investors shall have the right to among other things exercise directly (through
the voting trust described below) the drag-along rights described without the
requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK first take any action.

         Warrants. The Warrants may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any
time, unless previously purchased or cancelled upon a redemption of the Notes,
at the option of the holders prior to the time of maturity of the Notes for
Warrant Shares representing approximately 27% of TW UK's fully diluted ordinary
share capital, subject to antidilution adjustment as contained in the Securities
Purchase Documents.

         The exercise price of the Warrants shall equal the entire principal
amount of the Notes (other than PIK Notes and excluding any accrued unpaid
interest) for all Warrants in the aggregate and can be exercised for cash or
through the tender of Notes (other than PIK Notes) to TW UK, whereby TW UK shall
issue to the Investors the appropriate number of Warrant Shares and pay to the
Investors in cash an amount equal to the principal amount of the PIK Notes and
all accrued unpaid interest on the Notes and the PIK Notes. In the event that
any warrants are exercised by tendering cash, the UK Parent shall have the
right, at its option (which it intends to exercise), to redeem the aggregate
principal amount of Notes equal to the number of warrants so exercised
multiplied by the warrant exercise price.

                                       31
<PAGE>

         The Warrants will automatically be exercised for Warrant Shares in the
event that TW UK consummates a public offering of shares valuing the Investors'
ordinary shares of TW UK issuable upon a voluntary exercise of the Warrants at
or above 2.5x the initial investment.

         The Investors will have the right, at their option, to require UK
Parent to purchase all or any portion of the Warrants or the Warrant Shares
under certain circumstances and in accordance with the terms of the Securities
Purchase Documents. The purchase price of the Warrants shall be equal to the
difference, if a positive number, between (i) the fair market value of the
Warrant Shares which the Investors have the right to acquire upon exercise of
such Warrants and (ii) the exercise price of such Warrants. The purchase price
of the Warrant Shares shall be equal to the fair market value of such Warrant
Shares.

         UK Parent's purchase obligation of the Warrants is guaranteed by TW UK,
which guarantee is subordinated to existing senior indebtedness of TW UK. If UK
Parent fails to perform in full its obligations following exercise of the
Investors put of Warrants and TW UK fails to perform its obligations as a
guarantor of such obligations, the Investors shall have the right to among other
things exercise directly through the Voting Trust the drag-along rights without
the requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK first take any action.

         If UK Parent fails to perform in full its obligations following
exercise of the Investors put of Warrant Shares, the Investor shall have the
right to among other things exercise directly through the Voting Trust the
drag-along rights without the requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK
first take any action.

         Following an initial public offering and upon exchange of the Warrants
the Investors shall be entitled to two demand rights and unlimited piggyback
registrations with respect to the Warrant Shares. The Warrant Shares shall be
listed for trading on any securities exchange on which the ordinary shares of TW
UK are listed for trading.

         All ordinary shares of UK Parent owned by the Company and all ordinary
shares of TW UK owned by UK Parent will be held in a voting trust for the
benefit of the holders of ordinary shares of TW UK and the holders of the
Warrants, with the trustee of the trust being obligated to vote the shares held
in trust as follows: (i) to elect to the Board of Directors of TW UK individuals
designated in accordance with the Securities Purchase Documents and on any other
matter, pursuant to instructions approved by the required majority of the Board
of Directors of TW UK as contemplated by the Securities Purchase Documents; and
(ii) following the breach by UK Parent and TW UK of their obligations to honor
an Investor put of Notes, an Investor put of Warrants or an Investor put of
Warrant Shares, the Investors have the right to exercise drag-along rights
directly without any action of the Board of Directors of TW UK on a transaction
to which such drag-along rights apply pursuant to instructions from the
Investors. G. Richard Green, a Director of the Company, is the trustee of the
Voting Trust. The Voting Trust includes provisions to the effect that under
certain circumstances the shares held in trust shall thereafter be voted on all
matters, including the election of directors, pursuant to instructions from a
majority of those members of the Board of Directors of TW UK who are not
affiliated or associated with the Company, HPII, or any of their successors.

         The Articles of Association of TW UK and the Securities Purchase
Documents provide that neither UK Parent nor TW UK will enter into any
transaction with or make contributions to the Company or UK Parent (except as
required by the terms of the Notes, the Warrants or the Warrant Shares) in the
form of dividends, fees, re-charges, loans, guarantees or any other benefit, in
any form, unless they have been previously agreed upon by all shareholders.

                                       32
<PAGE>

         The Securities Purchase Documents also provide that the Investors will
have the benefit of customary shareholder rights for a transaction of this type
including, without limitation: (i) pre-emptive rights with respect to new
securities; (ii) rights of first refusal with respect to proposed transfers of
ordinary shares of TW UK; (iii) drag-along rights; (iv) tag-along rights; and
(v) the exercise of voting rights by the holders of the Warrants as therein
described including the right to elect one director to the TW UK Board of
Directors. The Securities Purchase Documents also include limitations on TW UK's
ability to do the following, among others, without the consent of the Investors:
(i) issue additional equity securities of TW UK; (ii) pay dividends or make
other restricted payments, except as required by the terms of the Notes, the
Warrants or the Warrant Shares; (iii) sell, lease or otherwise dispose of assets
exceeding specified values; (iv) enter into any transactions with affiliates;
(v) amend the Memorandum or Articles of Association; or (vi) merge or
consolidate with another entity.

      ACQUISITION OF NIGHTINGALE.

         On April 6, 2000 TW UK acquired all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Nightingale, a London based provider of registered nursing and care
staff to NHS Trust Hospitals and the independent sector, with an additional
branch in Sydney, Australia, for approximately $15,362,000, plus an additional
sum of up to approximately $5,600,000 in deferred consideration dependent upon
Pre-Tax Profits (as defined in the agreement for sale and purchase) for certain
periods ending in 2000 and 2001.

         Approximately $13,691,000 of the purchase price for the acquisition was
paid using cash on hand and funds borrowed under the senior credit facilities
with the approximate remaining $1,671,000 of consideration being paid in
1,050,000 shares of 5 pence par value class A1 common shares of TW UK.

         U.S. MAIL-ORDER OPERATIONS SALE

         In September 2000, the Company approved a plan to exit its U.S.
Mail-Order Operations and on September 18, 2000, entered into an agreement to
sell certain assets of this division located in Jacksonville, Florida. Under the
terms of the transaction, the Company will receive $2,000,000 plus $556,000
representing the book value of saleable on-hand inventory at September 29, 2000.
The Company has recognized a pre-tax charge for impairment of long-lived assets
of $12,346,000, principally reflecting the write-down of intangible assets to
their fair value. Based on the estimated net proceeds from the sale, which
closed on October 3, 2000, the fair values of the assets to be sold are recorded
as assets held for sale in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at September
30, 2000.

         In addition to the sale of certain assets, the Company has entered into
a Receivables Management Agreement ("Agreement") with the buyer. Under the terms
of the Agreement, the buyer will manage the collection of the pre-closing trade
receivables through March 31, 2001.

         The Company recorded a $1,288,000 restructuring charge in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2000 representing the estimated costs related to exiting the
business and closing its U.S. Mail-Order Operations. The restructuring charge
includes $128 for the write-off of unrecoverable leasehold improvements,
$680,000 to satisfy existing lease obligations and $480,000 for severance and
employee related costs. The employee costs represent termination benefits for
all 97 employees of the U.S. Mail Order Operations. As of September 30, 2000, no
amounts related to the lease obligations or employee related costs have been
paid.

         AMCARE SALE.

         On November 22, 2000, the Company sold Amcare, for approximately
$14,200,000 in cash. The Company has recorded a charge for impairment of
long-lived assets of $2,727,000 in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations, for the year ended September 30, 2000, to reflect the write-down of
the carrying value of goodwill, originally acquired with the purchase of Amcare,
to its fair value. In addition, the Company has recorded a tax charge of
approximately $1,654,000 to reflect the tax effect of the transaction.

                                       33

         TNI SALE.

         On July 15, 1998, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of
its domestic home nursing subsidiary for $5,300,000 which was paid in cash at
closing. Subject to the terms of the agreement, $300,000 of such amount was
placed into escrow for a period of one year following the closing to secure
TNI's obligations under the agreement. Proceeds from the sale were used to
reduce borrowings under the former Credit Facility ($4,100,000) and to satisfy
transaction costs and liabilities that were retained by the Company.

         ACQUISITION OF HMI/SALE TO COUNSEL.

         On October 1, 1997, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
completed the merger with HMI. Under the terms of a merger agreement, HMI
stockholders received $.30 in cash for each outstanding share of HMI common
stock not already owned by the Company. Concurrently with the closing of the
merger, the Company completed the HMI Asset Sale to Counsel for $40,000,000 at
which time substantially all of the businesses and operations of HMI were sold
to Counsel. Of the $40,000,000 proceeds, $30,000,000 was received in cash with
$7,500,000 to be paid to the Company as HMI's accounts receivable, existing at
date of sale, were collected, with the remaining $2,500,000 held in escrow for
post-closing adjustments. As of September 30, 1999 an aggregate (including
interest earned on such escrow funds) of $37,648,000 was received (including the
$7,500,000 escrow that was held for accounts receivable collection) of which,
$25,000,000 was used to reduce the senior secured debt owed by the Company under
the former Credit Facility, $2,800,000 was used to complete the merger and the
remainder was used for costs, fees and other expenses to complete the HMI Asset
Sale as well as to satisfy liabilities not assumed by Counsel. The remaining
$2,500,000 escrow was fully utilized for post-closing adjustments.

         Pursuant to the HMI Asset Sale, Counsel did not assume any liabilities
of HMI other than certain liabilities arising after the closing under assumed
contracts and certain employee-related liabilities. Liabilities not assumed by
Counsel, as well as certain wind-down and contingent obligations of HMI
(including litigation - see "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal
proceedings concerning HMI), were recorded in the Company's consolidated
financial statements in accordance with purchase accounting.

         YEAR 2000.

         The Year 2000 computer issue refers to potential conditions in computer
programs whereby a two-digit field rather than a four-digit field is used to
define the applicable year. Unless corrected, some computer programs may not
appropriately function as of January 1, 2000 because these programs will read
the "00" in the year 2000 as January 1, 1900. If uncorrected, the problem could
have resulted in computer system failures or equipment and medical device
malfunctions (affecting patient diagnosis and treatment) thereby disrupting the
Company's business operations and subjecting the Company to potentially
significant legal liabilities. To date, there have been no material malfunctions
of the Company's systems or activities due to Year 2000 issues. However, there
can be no assurance that unanticipated events still will not occur or that the
Company was able to identify all Year 2000 issues before problems arise.

         As of November 1, 2000, costs incurred for all efforts of the Company's
Year 2000 action plan amounted to $245,000 and have not been material to the
Company. These costs have been expensed as incurred and have been funded by
operating cash flows. Based upon the best estimate by the Company's management,
the Company does not expect any additional costs associated with the Company's
Year 2000 action plan. If additional costs are incurred they will also be
expensed as incurred and be funded by operating cash flow.

                                       34
<PAGE>



         The Company relies heavily upon third party payors, including to a
large extent governmental payors such as the NHS in the U.K. and Medicare and
Medicaid in the U.S. for accurate and timely reimbursement of claims, often
through the use of electronic data interfaces. Although much has been published
publicly stating that the government was working to solve its own Year 2000
issues in a timely manner, the Company has received no assurance that their
systems and interfaces were converted timely. Failure of any of the Company's
third party payors, especially governmental payors, to solve their Year 2000
issues could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.

         There can be no assurance that unanticipated events still will not
occur or that the Company was able to identify all Year 2000 issues before
problems arise. In addition, the Company has no assurance that third party
payors and vendors have or had the ability to identify and solve all or
substantially all their Year 2000 issues. Therefore, there can be no assurance
that the Year 2000 issue still will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

         CONTINGENCIES.

         Some of the Company's subsidiaries are Medicare Part B suppliers who
submit claims to the designated carrier who is the government's claims
processing administrator. From time to time, the carrier may request an audit of
Medicare Part B claims on a prepayment or postpayment basis. Some of the
Company's subsidiaries currently have pending such audits. If the outcome of any
audit results in a denial or a finding of an overpayment, then the affected
subsidiary has appeal rights. Some of the subsidiaries currently are responding
to these audits and pursuing appeal rights in certain circumstances.

         LITIGATION.

         See "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal proceedings
concerning the Company and HMI.

         IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

         The Company is currently evaluating the future impact that Staff
Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101, "Revenue Recognition," issued in December 1999
by the Securities and Exchange Commission may have on the Company's consolidated
financial statements in the future. SAB 101 is effective no later than the
fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. The Company
will adopt SAB 101 in fiscal year ended September 30, 2001.

         In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB")
issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities." SFAS No. 133 addresses the accounting for derivative instruments
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for
hedging activities. The Company hedged the interest rate in connection with a
component of its Refinancing (see Interest Rate Risk below). As issued, SFAS No.
133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 1999, with earlier application encouraged. In June 1999, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133," which amended the
effective date of SFAS No. 133 for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 in 2001 and
is in the process of evaluating its impact on the consolidated financial
statements.

         INFLATION

         Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations
to date.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

         FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

         The Company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices
evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated
financial results. The Company's primary exposure relates to non-U.S. dollar
denominated sales in the U.K. where the principal currency is Pounds Sterling.
Currently, the Company does not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures.


         INTEREST RATE RISK

         The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relate primarily to the Company's cash equivalents and the U.K. subsidiaries'
December 20, 1999 Refinancing which includes the Senior Credit Facility and
Mezzanine Loan. The Company's cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term
investments purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less. The Company is
subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact its consolidated results
of operations or cash flows for its variable rate Senior Credit Facility,
Mezzanine Loan and cash equivalents. In accordance with provisions of the
Refinancing, on January 25, 2000, the Company hedged the interest rate (LIBOR
cap of 9%) on approximately $41,935,000 of its floating rate debt in a contract
which expires June 30, 2003. The approximate notional amount of the contract
adjusts down (consistent with debt maturity) as follows:

December 31, 2000         $38,633,000
June 30, 2001             $36,982,000
December 31, 2001         $35,331,000
June 30, 2002             $32,855,000
December 31, 2002         $30,378,000


         As of September 30, 2000, the Company's Notes ($32,604,000) and PIK
Notes ($2,403,000) mature on December 31, 2008 and bear interest at a fixed rate
of 9.375%. The table below represents the expected maturity of the Company's
variable rate debt and their weighted average interest rates at September 30,
2000.

                     EXPECTED      WEIGHTED AVERAGE

                ==============

         The aggregate fair value of the Company's debt was estimated based on
quoted market prices for the same or similar issues and approximated $94,392,000
at September 30, 2000.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
        FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

         Effective May 12, 2000, the Company dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP as the Company's independent accountant. The reports of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on the consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 contained no adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope or accounting principles. In connection with its audits for the two
most recent fiscal years and through May 12, 2000, there have been no
disagreements with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or
procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP would have caused them to make reference thereto in
their reports on the consolidated financial statements for such years.

         The decision to change accountants was approved by both the Company's
Audit Committee and its Board of Directors.

         On May 12, 2000, the Company engaged Ernst & Young LLP as its new
independent accountant. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 1999, 1998
and during the subsequent period ended May 12, 2000, neither the Company nor
anyone on its behalf consulted Ernst & Young LLP regarding (i) the application
of accounting principles to any transaction, either completed or proposed, or
(ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered by Ernst & Young LLP on
the Company's financial statements.

         BOARD COMMITTEES

         The Company's Board of Directors has an Audit Committee and a
Compensation Committee but does not have a nominating committee. The members of
each committee are appointed by the Board of Directors.

         AUDIT COMMITTEE.

         The Audit Committee recommends to the Board of Directors the auditing
firm to be selected each year as independent auditors of the Company's
consolidated financial statements and to perform services related to the
completion of such audit. The Audit Committee also has responsibility for: (i)
reviewing the scope and results of the audit; (ii) reviewing the Company's
financial condition and results of operations with management and integrity of
the Company's financial statements; (iii) considerin the adequacy of the
internal accounting and control procedures of the Company and compliance with
legal and regulatory requirements; and (iv) reviewing any non-audit services and
special engagements to be performed by the independent auditors and considering
the effect of such performance on the auditors' independence. Messrs. Shay,
Green and Peris constitute the Audit Committee.

         COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.

         The Compensation Committee reviews and approves overall policy with
respect to compensation matters, including such matters as compensation plans
for employees and employment agreements and compensation for executive officers.
The Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Ranieri and Shay.

         COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

         The Commission has comprehensive rules relating to the reporting of
securities transactions by directors, officers and shareholders who beneficially
own more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock (collectively, the "Reporting
Persons"). These rules are complex and difficult to interpret. Based solely on a
review of Section 16 reports received by the Company from Reporting Persons, the
Company believes that no Reporting Person has failed to file a Section 16 report
on a timely basis during the most recent fiscal other than John B. Wynne, who
inadvertently did not file his Form 3.

         EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS; TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL
ARRANGEMENTS

         In January 1997, the Company entered into an employment agreement with
Mr. Aitken, which expired in January 1998. The agreement renews for one-year
terms every January absent notice of non-renewal from either party. Effective
October 1, 2000, this agreement provides for a base salary of $350,000. The
agreement contains, among other things, customary confidentiality and
termination provisions and provides that in the event of the termination of the
executive following a "change of control" of the Company (as defined therein),
Mr. Aitken will be entitled to receive a cash payment of up to 2.9 times his
average annual base salary during the preceding five years.

         In connection with Ms. Eames' employment with the Company, the Company
has agreed that if Ms. Eames' employment is terminated (other than for cause)
she will be entitled to one year's salary plus relocation expenses to
California. Effective October 1, 2000, Ms. Eames' agreement provides for a base
salary of $325,000.

         COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

         The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors consists of
Messrs. Ranieri and Shay. Messrs. Ranieri and Shay among others, control the

         STOCK OPTION PLANS

         1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN.

         In July 1992, the Company's Board of Directors and shareholders
approved the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan (the "Option Plan"). The Option
Plan provides for the grant of options to key employees, officers, directors and
non-employee independent contractors of the Company. The Option Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Beginning
in fiscal 1999 and ending in July 2002, the number of shares available for
issuance under the Option Plan, as amended, increases by one percent of the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the first day of each fiscal
year. As of November 1, 2000, the number of shares of Common Stock available for
issuance thereunder is 3,526,383 shares.

         Options granted under the Option Plan may be either incentive stock
options ("Incentive Options"), which are intended to meet the requirements of
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or options that do
not qualify as Incentive Options ("Non-Qualified Options"). Under the Option
Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant (i) Incentive Options at an exercise
price per share which is not less than the fair market value of a share of
Common Stock on the date on which such Incentive Options are granted (and not
less than 110% of the fair market value in the case of any optionee who
beneficially owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of the
Company) and (ii) Non-Qualified Options at an exercise price per share which is
determined by the Compensation Committee (and which may be less than the fair
market value of a share of Common Stock on the date on which such Non-Qualified
Options are granted). The Option Plan further provides that the maximum period
in which options may be exercised will be determined by the Compensation
Committee, except that Incentive Options may not be exercised after the
expiration of ten years from the date the Incentive Option was initially granted
(and five years in the case of any optionee who beneficially owns more than 10%
of the total combined voting power of the Company). Under the Option Plan, if an
optionee's employment is terminated, generally the unexercised Incentive Options
must be exercised within three months after termination. However, if the
termination is due to the optionee's death or permanent disability, the option
must be exercised within one year of the termination of employment. If the
optionee's employment is terminated for cause by the Company, or if the optionee
voluntarily terminates his employment, his options will expire as of the
termination date. Any option granted under the Option Plan will be
nontransferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and
generally may be exercised upon payment of the option price in cash or by
delivery of shares of Common Stock with a fair market value equal to the option
price.

         Shares delivered under the Option Plan will be available from
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or from shares of Common Stock
reacquired by the Company. Shares of Common Stock that are subject to options
under the Option Plan which have terminated or expired unexercised will return
to the pool of shares available for issuance under the Option Plan.

         On June 22, 2000, the Company granted options to purchase 50,000 shares
of Common Stock at $1.81 per share under the Option Plan to Mr. Wynne.

         1997 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR PLAN.

         In May 1997, the Company adopted the Company's 1997 Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors (the "Director Plan") pursuant to which 100,000 shares of
Common Stock of the Company were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
options granted to non-employee directors of the Company. The purpose of the
Director Plan is to encourage ownership of Common Stock by non-employee
directors of the Company whose continued services are considered essential to
the Company's future progress and to provide them with a further incentive to
remain as directors of the Company. The Director Plan is administered by the
Board of Directors. Directors of the Company who are not employees of the
Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company are eligible to
participate in the Director Plan. The term of the Director Plan is ten years
from the date of approval by the stockholders; however, options outstanding on
the expiration of the term shall continue to have full force and effect in
accordance with the provisions of the instruments evidencing such options. The
Board of Directors may suspend, terminate, revise or amend the Director Plan,
subject to certain limitations.

                                       43
<PAGE>

         Under the Director Plan, the Board of Directors may from time to time
at its discretion determine which of the eligible directors should receive
options, the number of shares subject to such options and the dates on which
such options are to be granted. Each such option is immediately exercisable for
a period of ten years from the date of grant generally, but may not be exercised
more than 90 days after the date an optionee ceases to serve as a director of
the Company. Options granted under the Director Plan are not transferable by the
optionee other than by will, laws of descent and distribution, or as required by
law.

         Common Stock may be purchased from the Company upon the exercise of an
option by payment in cash or cash equivalent, through the delivery of shares of
Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the cash exercise price of the
option or any combination of the above, subject to the discretion of the Board
of Directors.

         STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

         In January, 2000, TW UK adopted a management incentive plan (the "UK
Plan"). Under the UK Plan, a new class of redeemable shares (having a nominal
value of 0.01p) in the capital of TW UK was created (the "Redeemable Shares"),
which are redeemable in the manner described below. Pursuant to the UK Plan
9,800,000 Redeemable Shares are reserved for issuance. Under the UK Plan the
Redeemable shares may be issued at their nominal value and with an option price
set by the board of directors of TW UK (the "Initial Value"). On March 7, 2000,
TW UK issued 3,500,000, 1,800,000 and 4,200,000 Redeemable Shares, with an
Initial Value of 105p per share, to Mr. Aitken, Ms. Eames and various employees
and members of management of TW UK and its subsidiaries, respectively. On July
10, 2000, 120,000 additional Redeemable Shares were issued to a member of
management of TW UK and its subsidiaries with an Initial Value of 125p per
share. The redemption rights attached to the Redeemable Shares are exercisable
at any time during the period commencing on the date of a qualified public
offering in the UK and ending 10 years from the date of issuance. The net effect
of the exercise of redemption rights is that the holder acquires ordinary shares
of TW UK at a price per ordinary share equal to the Initial Value. The
Redeemable Shares do not carry any dividend or income rights and do not carry
any right to vote at general meetings of TW UK. All terms associated with the
shares are fixed and the market value of an ordinary share of TW UK was less
than the Initial Values of 105p and 125p therefore no compensation expense has
been recognized.

         INDEMNIFICATION

         As permitted under the Business Corporation Law of the State of New
York, the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a
director of the Company will not be personally liable to the Company or its
shareholders for monetary damages for breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the
Company or its shareholders. By its terms and in accordance with the law of the
State of New York, however, this provision does not eliminate or otherwise limit
the liability of a director of the Company for any breach of duty based upon (i)
an act or omission (A) resulting from acts committed in bad faith or involving
intentional misconduct or involving a knowing violation of law or (B) from which
the director personally derived a financial benefit to which he was not legally
entitled, or (ii) an improper declaration of dividends or purchases of the
Company's securities.

         The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws provide
that the Company shall indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest
extent permitted by New York state law. The Company also has entered into
indemnification agreements with each of its directors and officers.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

         TRANSACTIONS WITH PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS

         Under a unit purchase agreement dated November 20, 1995, as amended
(the "HPII Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which HPII acquired its initial
equity interest in the Company, until July 31, 2001, HPII has the right to
designate to the Board of Directors of the Company the greater of three
directors or 40% of the number of directors constituting the entire Board of
Directors. Messrs. Ranieri and Shay are the HPII designees presently serving on
the Board of Directors.

         The HPII Purchase Agreement also provides that for a period of five (5)
years commencing on May 30, 1996, all shares of Common Stock held by HPII will
be voted by HPII on any matter submitted to the shareholders in the same
proportion as the votes cast by the other holders of Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, HPII retains its right to vote its shares of
Common Stock in any manner it chooses with respect to the following specified
matters: (i) the election to the Board of Directors of HPII's designees; (ii)
amendments to the Company's By-Laws or Certificate of Incorporation; (iii)
mergers and the sale, lease or exchange of the Company's assets; (iv) the
authorization or issuance of Company securities; (v) a reclassification of
securities or reorganization of the Company; (vi) the liquidation or dissolution
of the Company; and (vii) any affiliated party transaction. The HPII Purchase
Agreement provides that the requirement that HPII votes its shares in proportion
with all other shareholders shall terminate in the event that the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock owned by certain former officers of the Company
shall be less than 415,000 shares or on the date when any person or group
unaffiliated with HPII becomes the beneficial owner of 25% or more of the
then-outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock.

         The HPII Purchase Agreement further provides that commencing July 31,
1996, all actions to be taken by the Board of Directors will require the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a duly constituted
meeting (which is the status currently), except that it shall require the
affirmative vote of 66-2/3% of the entire Board of Directors to authorize any
action taken with respect to a proposed acquisition, whether by purchase of
stock or assets, of another company and any action to increase above seven (7)
the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.

         During the summer of 1999 the Company's U.K. Operations were in the
process of acquiring three nursing and carer agencies when the Company was
informed by its senior lenders that they would not consent to these pending
acquisitions. The Company then requested that HPII complete these acquisitions
on the Company's behalf. Affiliates of HPII (the "HP Affiliates") completed
these acquisitions in August and September, 1999. Effective December 17, 1999,
the Company acquired all three businesses from the HPII Affiliates for the
aggregate amount of $2,992,000 representing HPII's acquisition cost plus,
interest at a rate of 12% per annum and reimbursement of transaction costs.
Messrs. Ranieri and Shay did not participate in any action by the Board of
Directors with respect to these acquisitions.

         TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

         In connection with the Refinancing, Mr. Aitken (the Company's Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer), Ms. Eames (the Company's President), Mr. Palladino
(the Company's former Chief Financial Officer), Mr. Green (a director of the
Company) and certain other directors and officers of TW UK and its subsidiaries
co-invested, alongside the other Investors, $800,000, $100,000, $25,000 and
$1,100,000, respectively, in senior subordinated notes and also received
warrants exercisable into approximately 2% in the aggregate of the fully diluted
ordinary shares of TW UK. The terms of the senior subordinated notes and
warrants acquired by the foregoing persons are identical to the senior
subordinated notes and warrants acquired by the other Investors. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources."

         Certain officers of the Company have been granted options to purchase
shares of Common Stock under the Company's stock option plans. See "Executive
Compensation - Stock Option Plans."

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Shareholders and Board of Directors
Transworld Healthcare, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Transworld
Healthcare, Inc. as of September 30, 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then
ended. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 14(a) for the year ended September 30, 2000. These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Transworld
Healthcare, Inc. at September 30, 2000, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule for the year ended September
30, 2000, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

TRANSWORLD HEALTHCARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)




1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

     Transworld Healthcare, Inc. (the "Company") is a provider of a broad range
     of health care services and products with operations in the United Kingdom
     ("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S."). The Company provides the following
     services and products: (i) patient services, including nursing and
     para-professional services; (ii) respiratory therapy and home medical
     equipment; and (iii) infusion therapy.

     The Company was a provider of specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals and
     medical supplies. In September 2000, the Company entered into an agreement,
     which was completed on October 3, 2000, to sell a substantial portion of
     the assets of its U.S. Specialty Mail-Order Pharmaceuticals and Medical
     Supplies Operations ("Mail-Order Operations"). See Note 3.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on the
     accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
     accounting standards.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:

     On December 20, 1999, the Company's U.K. subsidiaries obtained new
     financing (the "Refinancing") denominated in pounds sterling, which
     aggregated approximately $125,700 at December 31, 1999. Concurrent with the
     Refinancing, specifically relating to the senior subordinated notes (the
     "Notes"), the Company placed 100% of its ownership interest in Transworld
     Healthcare (UK) Limited ("TW UK") into a voting trust (the "Voting Trust").
     As a result of the establishment of the Voting Trust, the Company would
     initially own 100% of the outstanding voting certificates. The term of the
     Voting Trust is 20 years. The Voting Trust agreement stipulates that the
     composition of the board of directors of TW UK will consist of one person
     designated by the Company, one person appointed by the purchasers of the
     Notes, one representative of TW UK management (currently the Chairman and
     Chief Executive Officer of the Company) and two independent directors. The
     board of directors of TW UK will then vote on substantially all matters
     regarding its operations. G. Richard Green, a director of the Company, is
     the trustee of the Voting Trust.

     As a result of the provisions of the Voting Trust discussed above, the
     Company controlled only 50% of the board of directors and the holders of
     the Notes (the "Investors") had the right to approve or veto the annual
     budget and financial forecast of results of operations and sources and uses
     of cash and any material deviation from such approved budget. Since the
     Company did not control a majority of the board of directors and the
     Investors held substantive rights, principally in the form of their ability
     to approve the annual budget and financial forecast of results of
     operations and sources and uses of cash, it was no longer able to
     consolidate the U.K. subsidiaries into its financial statements although it
     owned 100% of the outstanding shares of the stock of the parent company,
     Transworld Holdings (UK) Limited ("UK Parent"). Therefore, effective with
     the Refinancing, the Company began accounting for the investment in UK
     Parent and its subsidiaries under the equity method, retroactive to October
     1, 1999.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)



2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, UK Parent and TW UK amended their
     Articles of Association to give the Chairman (a Company designee) the right
     to resolve any tie votes of the board of directors and certain documents
     covering the Notes were amended to eliminate the requirement that the
     Investors approve the operating budget. These amendments enabled the
     Company to consolidate the U.K. subsidiaries as of January 1, 2000.

     The table below presents pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
     operations data as if the U.K. subsidiaries had been consolidated for the
     entire year ended September 30, 2000.

     PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA

     Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2000
     Net revenues                                       $ 164,255
     Gross profit                                          54,620
     Operating loss                                       (22,415)
     Interest income                                       (1,503)
     Interest expense                                       9,598
     Benefit for income taxes                              (6,255)
     Net loss                                             (24,944)


     REVENUE RECOGNITION:

     Patient services and infusion and respiratory therapy revenues are
     recognized when services are performed and are recorded net of estimated
     contractual adjustments based on agreements with third-party payors, where
     applicable. Revenues from home medical equipment (including respiratory
     equipment) are recognized over the period the equipment is rented
     (typically on a month-to-month basis) and approximated $6,148, $5,844 and
     $6,711 in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Revenues from the sale
     of pharmaceuticals and supplies are recognized when products are shipped
     and are recorded at amounts expected to be paid by third-party payors.

     The Company receives a majority of its revenue from third-party insurance
     companies, the National Health Services (the "NHS") and other U.K.
     governmental payors, Medicare and Medicaid. The amount paid by third-party
     payors is dependent upon the benefits included in the patient's policy or
     as allowable amounts set by third-party payors. Certain revenues are
     subject to review by third-party payors, and adjustments, if any, are
     recorded when determined. For the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and
     1998, 44%, 36% and 30%, respectively of the Company's net revenues were
     attributable to the NHS and other U.K. governmental payors programs. For
     the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company's net
     revenues attributable to the Medicare and Medicaid programs were
     approximately 18%, 23% and 33%, respectively, of the Company's total
     revenues.

     INCOME TAXES:

     The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in
     accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
     109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under this method, deferred income tax
     assets and liabilities reflect tax carryforwards and the net effects of

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
     liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes, as determined
     under currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recorded if
     future realization is more likely than not.

     Deferred taxes are recorded primarily for bad debts, Federal and state net
     operating loss carry forwards, depreciation and amortization of
     intangibles, which are reported in different periods for Federal income tax
     purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Valuation allowances are
     established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
     expected to be realized.

     EARNINGS PER SHARE:

     Effective October 1, 1997, the Company adopted the provisions SFAS No. 128,
     "Earnings per Share" ("EPS"). SFAS No. 128 replaced primary EPS with basic
     EPS and fully diluted EPS with diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed using the
     weighted average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect
     to issuable shares per agreements. Diluted EPS is computed using the
     weighted average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect
     to contingently issuable shares per agreements and dilutive stock options
     and warrants using the treasury stock method. At September 30, 2000, 1999
     and 1998, the Company had outstanding stock options and warrants to
     purchase 3,940, 3,683 and 3,965 shares, respectively of common stock
     ranging in price from $2.63 to $12.45, $4.31 to $12.45 and $4.38 to $12.45
     per share, respectively, that were not included in the computation of
     diluted EPS because the exercise price was greater than the average market
     price of the common shares. In addition, for the years ended September 30,
     2000 and 1999, the Company had an incremental weighted average of 12 and
     128 shares, respectively, of stock options and warrants which were not
     included in the diluted computation as the effect of such inclusion would
     have been anti-dilutive due to a net loss position.

</TABLE>


     IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS:

     Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
     circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If
     the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying
     amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the
     fair value (discounted future cash flows) and carrying value of the asset.
     Impairment loss on assets to be sold, if any, is based on the estimated
     proceeds to be received, less estimated costs to sell (See Notes 3 and 16).

     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
     prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles Board's Opinion No.
     25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB No. 25"). Under APB No.
     25, generally, no compensation expense is recognized in connection with the
     awarding of stock option grants to employees provided that, as of the grant
     date, all terms associated with the award are fixed and the quoted market
     price of the Company's stock is equal to or less than the amount an
     employee must pay to acquire the stock as defined. As the Company only
     issues fixed term stock option grants at the quoted market price on the
     date of the grant, there is no compensation expense recognized in the
     accompanying consolidated financial statements.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     Effective November 1, 1996, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
     123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which requires disclosure
     including pro forma operating results had the Company prepared its
     consolidated financial statements in accordance with the fair value based
     method of accounting for stock-based compensation (See Note 11).

     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME:

     Effective October 1, 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
     130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." This statement established standards
     for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in
     a full set of general purpose financial statements. Components of
     comprehensive income include net income and all other non-owner changes in
     equity, such as the change in the cumulative translation adjustment,
     unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale and minimum
     pension liability. Currency translation is the only item of other
     comprehensive income impacting the Company. The following table displays
     comprehensive (loss) income for the three years ended September 30:

     SEGMENT INFORMATION:

     Effective October 1, 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
     131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."
     SFAS No. 131 supercedes SFAS No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a
     Business Enterprise," replacing the "industry segment" approach with the
     "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal
     organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and
     assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.
     SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about products and services,
     geographic areas and major customers.

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:

     Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments
     purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     ASSETS LIMITED TO USE:

     Represents cash and cash equivalents, advanced under the Refinancing,
     available for payment of up to fifty percent of the total consideration
     payable in connection with Permitted Acquisition (as defined in the Senior
     Credit Agreement).

     INVENTORIES:

     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined using a first-in,
     first-out method) or market. Inventories, which consist primarily of
     finished goods, include pharmaceuticals, ancillary medical supplies and
     certain medical equipment.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:

     Property and equipment, including revenue producing equipment, is carried
     at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Revenue
     producing equipment in the U.K. consists of oxygen cylinders and oxygen
     concentrators. Depreciation for these oxygen cylinders and oxygen
     concentrators is provided on the straight-line method over their estimated
     useful lives of twenty and seven years, respectively. Revenue producing
     equipment in the U.S. consists of home medical equipment (e.g., respiratory
     equipment, beds and wheelchairs). Depreciation for this home medical
     equipment is provided primarily on the straight-line method over their
     estimated useful lives of three to seven years. Buildings are being
     depreciated over their useful lives of twenty-five to fifty years and
     leasehold improvements are amortized over the related lease terms or
     estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS:

     Intangible assets, consisting principally of goodwill and covenants
     not-to-compete, are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. All
     goodwill is enterprise goodwill and is amortized on a straight-line basis
     over its estimated useful life. Other intangible assets (primarily
     covenants not-to- compete) are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
     contractual period (three to fifteen years).

     The Company's amortization periods for goodwill range from ten to forty
     years based on the likely period of time over which the related economic
     benefit will be realized. The Company believes that the estimated goodwill
     life is reasonable given the continuing movement of patient care to
     non-institutional settings, increasing demand due to demographic trends,
     the emphasis of the Company on establishing significant coverage in its
     local and regional markets, the consistent practice with other alternate
     site health care companies and other factors (See Notes 3 and 16).

     At each balance sheet date, or if a significant adverse change occurs in
     the Company's business, management assesses the carrying amount of
     enterprise goodwill. The Company measures impairment of goodwill by
     comparing the future undiscounted cash flows (without interest) to the
     carrying amount of goodwill. This evaluation is done at the reportable
     business segment level (primarily by subsidiary). If the carrying amount of
     goodwill exceeds the future cash flows, the

(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)



2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     excess carrying amount of goodwill is written off. Factors considered by
     management in estimating future cash flows include current operating
     results, the effects of any current or proposed changes in third-party
     reimbursement or other governmental regulations, trends and prospects of
     acquired businesses, as well as the effect of demand, competition, market
     and other economic factors (See Notes 3 and 16).

     DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS:

     Costs incurred in obtaining long-term financing are amortized over the
     terms of the long-term financing agreements using the interest method. At
     September 30, 2000, other assets included $4,349 of deferred financing
     costs associated with the Refinancing (see Note 6) net of accumulated
     amortization of $746. Amortization of deferred financing costs is included
     in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
     Operations. At September 30, 1999, other assets included $1,357 of deferred
     financing costs associated with the Credit Facility (see Note 6), net of
     accumulated amortization of $3,242.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:

     Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is
     other than the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S. dollars using the
     exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations
     are translated using weighted average exchange rates during the period.
     Adjustments resulting from the translation process are included as a
     separate component of stockholders' equity.

     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK:

     Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
     concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
     The Company places its cash equivalents with high credit quality financial
     institutions. The Company believes no significant concentration of credit
     risk exists with respect to these cash equivalents.

     The Company grants credit without collateral to its patients, who are
     primarily insured under third-party agreements. The Company maintains an
     allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectibility of
     accounts receivable. Accounts receivable at September 30, 2000 is comprised
     of amounts due from the NHS and other U.K. governmental payors (46.0%),
     Medicare (9.2%) and Medicaid (4.3%) and various other third-party payors
     and self-pay patients (none of which comprise greater than 10% of the
     balance). At September 30, 1999, 40.3%, 10.9% and 3.8% of accounts
     receivable was due from the NHS and other U.K. governmental payors,
     Medicare and Medicaid, respectively with the balance due from various other
     third-party payors and self-pay patients (none of which comprise greater
     than 10% of the balance).

     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

     Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
     approximate fair value due to the

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     short-term maturity of those instruments. The estimated fair value of the
     Company's borrowing under the Refinancing was $94,392 compared to $93,483
     total debt outstanding at September 30, 2000. At September 30, 1999, the
     Credit Facility approximated the carrying value due to interest rates which
     fluctuate with market rates.

     IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:

     The Company is currently evaluating the future impact that Staff Accounting
     Bulletin ("SAB") 101, "Revenue Recognition," issued in December 1999 by the
     Securities and Exchange Commission may have on the Company's consolidated
     financial statements in the future. SAB 101 is effective no later than the
     fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. The
     Company will adopt SAB 101 in fiscal year ended September 30, 2001.

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
     SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
     Activities." SFAS No. 133 addresses the accounting for derivative
     instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
     contracts and for hedging activities. As issued, SFAS No. 133 is effective
     for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999,
     with earlier application encouraged. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No.
     137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -
     Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133," which amended the
     effective date of SFAS No. 133 for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
     beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 in 2001
     and is in the process of evaluating its impact on the consolidated
     financial statements.

     USE OF MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES:

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
     assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
     disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
     financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
     during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
     estimates. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for
     allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventories, accrued
     expenses, depreciation and amortization.

     RECLASSIFICATIONS:

     Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the
     current year presentation.

3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS:

     COMBINATIONS:

     Effective April 1, 2000 TW UK acquired all of the issued and outstanding
     shares of Nightingale Nursing Bureau Limited ("Nightingale"), a
     London-based provider of registered nursing and care staff to NHS Trust
     Hospitals and the independent sector, with an additional branch in Sydney,
     Australia, for approximately $15,362, plus an additional sum of up to
     approximately $5,600 in deferred consideration dependent upon Pre-Tax
     Profits (as defined in the agreement for sale and purchase) for certain
     periods

(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)



3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS (CONTINUED):

     ending in 2000 and 2001. Approximately $13,691 of the purchase price for
     the acquisition was paid using cash on hand and funds borrowed under the
     senior credit facilities with the approximate remaining $1,671 of
     consideration being paid in 1,050 shares of 5 pence par value class A1
     common shares of TW UK. Accordingly, the Company has included the results
     of operations, financial position and cash flows of Nightingale in its
     consolidated results effective April 1, 2000.

     The total cost of the acquisition was allocated on the basis of the fair
     value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and incurred.
     Accordingly, assets and liabilities were assigned values of approximately
     $3,435 and $2,029, respectively, with the remaining portion of $13,956
     attributable to goodwill. The goodwill is being amortized on a
     straight-line basis over twenty years.

     The pro forma results of operations and related per share information for
     Nightingale have not been presented as amounts are considered immaterial.

     DISPOSITIONS:

     SPECIALTY PHARMACY

     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

     In September 2000, the Company approved a plan to exit its U.S. Mail-Order
     Operations and on September 18, 2000, entered into an agreement to sell
     certain assets of this segment located in Jacksonville, Florida. Under the
     terms of the transaction, the Company will receive $2,000 plus an
     additional $556 representing the book value of on-hand saleable inventory
     at September 29, 2000. The Company has recognized a pre-tax charge for
     impairment of long-lived assets of $12,346 principally reflecting the
     write-down of intangible assets to their fair value. Based on the estimated
     net proceeds from the sale, which closed on October 3, 2000, the fair
     values of the assets to be sold are recorded as assets held for sale in the
     accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2000.

     In addition to the sale of certain assets, the Company has entered into a
     Receivables Management Agreement ("Agreement") with the buyer. Under the
     terms of the Agreement, the buyer will manage the collection of the
     pre-closing trade receivables through March 31, 2001.

     Restructuring Charge

     The Company recorded a $1,288 restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of
     fiscal 2000 representing the estimated costs related to exiting and closing
     its U.S. Mail-Order Operations. The restructuring charge includes

3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS (CONTINUED):

     $128 for the write-off of unrecoverable leasehold improvements, $680 to
     satisfy existing lease obligations and $480 for severance and employee
     related costs. The employee costs represent termination benefits for all
     97 employees of the U.S. Mail-Order Operations. As of September 30, 2000,
     no amounts related to the lease obligations or employee related costs have
     been paid.

     TNI

     Effective July 12, 1998, the Company sold substantially all of the assets
     of Transworld Home HealthCare - Nursing Division, Inc. ("TNI") for $5,300,
     which was paid in cash at closing with $300 of such amount placed into
     escrow and released one year following the closing (the "TNI Sale").

     Results for TNI through July 12, 1998 have been included in the Company's
     results for the year ended September 30, 1998. The Company recognized a
     pre-tax gain on the TNI Sale of approximately $2,511.

     TERMINATION OF PENDING ACQUISITIONS:

     HMI

     During fiscal 1997, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding
     stock of Health Management, Inc. ("HMI") and disposed of all of HMI's
     assets and businesses in a series of transactions. HMI is a Buffalo Grove,
     Illinois based provider of integrated pharmacy management services to
     patients with chronic medical conditions and to health care professionals,
     drug manufacturers and third-party payors involved in such patients' care.

     On November 13, 1996, the Company acquired HMI's senior secured
     indebtedness under the credit agreement between HMI and its senior lenders
     for $21,263 directly from such lenders. In mid January 1997, the Company
     acquired 8,964 newly issued shares of HMI common stock, representing
     approximately 49% of HMI's outstanding common stock for $1 per share or
     $8,964.

     The $9,714 investment in HMI was recorded as of January 31, 1997 and
     represents 49% of HMI's equity in net tangible assets and after fair value
     adjustments, $15,835 was preliminarily allocated to goodwill, which was
     being amortized on a straight-line basis over thirty years. The acquisition
     of 49% of the outstanding shares of HMI common stock was accounted for by
     the Company under the equity method of accounting (effective as of January
     31, 1997). During the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company
     recorded $18,076 of equity in loss of HMI which represented 49% of HMI's
     loss for the six months ended July 31, 1997, after adjustments to book the
     Company's adjustment to historical goodwill amortization based on its fair
     value adjustments ($132) and to eliminate intercompany interest ($720). Due
     to the Company's decision, during the third quarter of fiscal 1997, to sell
     HMI and the recording of HMI's obligations that the Company was required to
     fund, in connection with the sale to Counsel Corporation ("Counsel"), no
     equity in loss of HMI has been booked subsequent to July 31, 1997.

3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS (CONTINUED):

     On August 14, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Asset Sale
     Agreement") with Counsel, an unrelated party, relating to the sale of
     substantially all of the businesses and operations of HMI (the "Asset
     Sale") for approximately $40,000. The Asset Sale Agreement required the
     Company to acquire the remaining 51% of HMI prior to the sale to Counsel.

     As a result of the Asset Sale Agreement, the Company recorded an impairment
     charge of $1,841 for its investment in HMI at July 31, 1997. The carrying
     amount of the investment was adjusted for costs and obligations to sell HMI
     (including contractually obligated costs to be incurred) compared with the
     gross proceeds on the Asset Sale. Such adjustments included the cost to
     purchase the remaining 51% of HMI ($2,800), transaction costs (principally
     legal expenses) associated with the sale to Counsel ($1,000), purchase
     price adjustments (primarily working capital adjustments) ($4,470), the
     acquisition of the HMI Receivables (as defined and described in Note 7)
     from Hyperion Partners II L.P. ("HPII") ($6,956) and the retained
     liabilities of HMI ($10,774). These retained liabilities consisted
     principally of legal expenses and settlement costs associated with the
     shareholder and class action litigation, settlement of accounts payable,
     severance and employee related costs and lease termination costs.

     On October 1, 1997, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
     purchased the remaining 51% of the outstanding shares of HMI's common stock
     for $.30 per common share. Concurrently, the Company completed the Asset
     Sale to Counsel for $40,000. Of the $40,000 proceeds, $30,000 was received
     in cash with $7,500 being paid to the Company as HMI's accounts receivable,
     existing at date of sale, were collected, with the remaining $2,500 held in
     escrow for post-closing adjustments. As of September 30, 2000 an aggregate
     (including interest earned on such escrow funds) of $37,648 was received
     (including the $7,500 that was held for accounts receivable collection) of
     which, $25,000 was used to reduce the senior secured debt owed by the
     Company under the Credit Facility, $2,800 was used to acquire the remaining
     51% of HMI and the remainder was used for costs, fees and other expenses to
     complete the HMI Asset Sale as well as to satisfy liabilities not assumed
     by Counsel. The remaining $2,500 escrow was fully utilized for post-closing
     adjustments.

     The Company also amended its Credit Facility on October 1, 1997 to
     accommodate the acquisition of the remaining 51% of HMI and the concurrent
     Asset Sale to Counsel.

     Pursuant to the Asset Sale, Counsel did not assume any liabilities of HMI
     other than certain liabilities arising after the closing under assumed
     contracts and certain employee-related liabilities.

1)   Net of unamortized discount of $2,093.


     The aggregate fair value of the Company's debt was estimated based on
     quoted market prices for the same or similar issues and approximated
     $94,392 at September 30, 2000.

     The mezzanine lenders and the Investors were also issued warrants to
     purchase approximately 2% and 27%, respectively, of the fully diluted
     shares of TW UK. The exercise price of the warrants issued to the Investors
     (the "Warrants") shall equal the entire principal amount of the Notes for
     all Warrants in the aggregate and can be exercised for cash or through the
     tender of Notes to TW UK. In the event that any warrants are exercised by
     tendering cash, the UK parent shall have the right, at its option (which it
     intends to exercise), to redeem the aggregate principal amount of Notes
     equal to the number of warrants so exercised multiplied by the warrant
     exercise price. The warrants issued to the mezzanine lenders (the
     "Mezzanine Warrants") are detachable and can be exercised at any time
     without condition for an aggregate exercise price of approximately $120.
     The fair value of the Mezzanine Warrants ($2,319) issued to the mezzanine
     lenders has been recorded as a discount to the mezzanine term loan and is
     being amortized over the term of the loan using the interest method.

     The Investors have the right, at their option, to require UK Parent to
     redeem all or any portion of the Notes under certain circumstances and in
     accordance with the terms of the documents covering the Notes. The
     redemption price of the Notes shall be equal to the principal amount of the
     Notes, plus all accrued and unpaid interest.

     The Investors will have the right, at their option, to require UK Parent to
     purchase all or any portion of the Warrants or the shares issued upon
     exercise of the Warrants (the "Warrant Shares") under certain circumstances
     and in accordance with the terms of the documents covering the Notes. The
     purchase price of the Warrants shall be equal to the difference, if a
     positive number, between (i) the fair market value of the Warrant Shares
     which the Investors have the right to acquire upon exercise of such
     Warrants and (ii) the exercise price of such Warrants. The purchase price
     of the Warrant Shares shall be equal to the fair market value of such
     Warrant Shares.

6.       DEBT (CONTINUED):

     Of the $114,178 net proceeds of the Refinancing, $55,755 was used to repay
     the Company's existing senior indebtedness (the "Credit Facility"), $11,617
     was provided to the Company for general corporate purposes in the U.S.,
     with the balance to be used for acquisitions and working capital in the
     U.K. At September 30, 1999, the Credit Facility had monthly interest at a
     Euro-dollar Rate, which ranged from 5.38% to 5.44%, plus 2% collateralized
     by a lien on all the Company's and its domestic subsidiaries assets.

     Repayment of the loans under the senior credit facilities commenced on July
     30, 2000 and will continue until final maturity. The acquisition loan may
     be drawn upon through December 17, 2002. As of September 30, 2000,
     borrowings under the senior credit facilities bore interest at a rate of
     8.11% to 8.86%. The senior credit facilities contain restrictions,
     prohibitions and affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily
     found in agreements of these kind.

     The loans under the senior credit facilities are collateralized by, among
     other things, a lien on substantially all of TW UK's assets, a pledge of TW
     UK's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and guaranties by TW UK's
     subsidiaries.

     With respect to the mezzanine term loan interest, LIBOR + 3.5% will be
     payable in cash, with the remaining interest being added to the principal
     amount of the loan. The mezzanine term loan contains terms and conditions
     substantially similar to those contained in the senior credit facilities.
     As of September 30, 2000, borrowings under the mezzanine term loan bore
     interest at a rate of 13.11%.

     Interest payments on the Notes are subject to restrictions contained in the
     senior credit facilities which require interest on the Notes to be paid
     in-kind through the issuance of additional notes for the first 18 months,
     with payment of interest in cash thereafter subject to meeting certain
     financial tests. The documents covering the Notes provide for customary
     rights for a transaction of this type, including: (i) pre-emptive rights
     with respect to new securities; (ii) rights of first refusal with respect
     to proposed transfers of shares of TW UK; (iii) drag-along rights; (iv)
     tag-along rights; (v) put and call provisions; and (vi) certain corporate
     actions which require the consent of the holder of the Notes.

     In connection with the repayment of the Credit Facility, the Company
     recorded a non-cash, after-tax, extraordinary charge of $759 (net of income
     tax benefit of $408) during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000,
     related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the
     Credit Facility.

     The Company is subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact its
     consolidated results of operations or cash flows for its variable rate
     Senior Credit Facility, Mezzanine Loan and cash equivalents. In accordance
     with provisions of the Refinancing, on January 25, 2000, the Company hedged
     the interest rate (LIBOR cap of 9%) on approximately $41,935 of its
     floating rate debt in a contract which expires June 30, 2003. The
     approximate notional amount of the contract adjusts down (consistent with
     debt maturity) as follows:

     December 31, 2000             $38,633
     June 30, 2001                 $36,982
     December 31, 2001             $35,331
     June 30, 2002                 $32,855
     December 31, 2002             $30,378


7.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

     On April 21, 1997, HPII purchased 899 shares of the Company's common stock
     at $11.125 per share and Hyperion TW Fund L.P. (the "Fund") purchased 4,116
     shares of the Company's common stock at $9.875 per share for an aggregate
     purchase price of $50,650 (collectively, the "Shares"). Collectively, HPII
     and the Fund are the Company's principal shareholders.

     In November and December 1996, HPII purchased from various unrelated third
     parties certain receivables (the "HMI Receivables") due from HMI at various
     discounts. The aggregate face amount of these receivables was approximately
     $18,300. On March 26, 1997, the Company entered into a stock purchase
     agreement, with HPII, as amended, to purchase these receivables from HPII
     for a number of shares of common stock (the "HPII Shares") as determined by
     a formula geared to the net cash proceeds ultimately realized by the
     Company upon sale of the HMI assets. The value per share of the HPII Shares
     was determined by the market value of the Company's common stock on the
     date of issuance. This transaction was approved at a special meeting of the
     shareholders held on March 17, 1998 and subsequently during April 1998,
     HPII was issued 1,159 shares of the Company's common stock with a value per
     share of $6.00. The aggregate value of the HPII Shares was $6,956 (Note
     13).

7.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED):

     No gain or loss was directly recorded as a result of this transaction, as
     it was considered a cost of acquiring HMI (Note 3).


8.   BUSINESS REALIGNMENT:

     The Company took a number of significant steps during the year ended
     September 30, 1998 to realign its business as a focused regional home
     health care provider and specialty pharmacy and medical supply distributor
     in the U.S. and an integrated national provider of health care products and
     services in the U.K. These steps included selling non-core assets (i.e.:
     TNI) and attempted acquisitions of Healthcall Group plc ("Healthcall") and
     Apria Healthcare Group, Inc. ("Apria"). During fiscal 1999, the Company
     attempted the acquisitions of Sinclair Montrose Healthcare PLC ("Sinclair")
     and Gateway HomeCare, Inc. ("Gateway").

     For the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company recorded in selling,
     general and administrative expenses $554 of charges primarily related to
     costs incurred from its attempted acquisitions of Healthcall and Apria and
     recorded a gain of $2,511 on the TNI Sale (Note 3).

     For the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company recorded in selling,
     general and administrative expenses $1,392 of charges primarily related to
     costs incurred from its attempted acquisitions of Sinclair and Gateway and
     legal reserves and recognized additional bad debt expenses of $3,605
     principally as a result of fully reserving for DermaQuest's accounts
     receivable, as the Company became aware of additional deterioration in
     their collectiblity, based upon the Company's payment history over the
     first nine months of fiscal 1999.


9.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION:

     On April 8, 1998, the Company forgave a $67 note receivable due from an
     officer of the Company. The debt was forgiven over a two year period
     (one-third in fiscal 1998 and two-thirds in fiscal 1999). The compensation
     expense recorded on the forgiveness of debt was $45 and $22 in fiscal 1999
     and 1998, respectively.

     For 2000, 1999 and 1998, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
     of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
     liabilities recorded for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
     for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred
     tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 are as

10.  INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED):

     The valuation allowance at September 30, 2000 relates to deferred tax
     assets established for certain state net operating loss carryforwards and
     deferred tax assets which are not expected to be realized based on
     historical or future earnings.

     Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will
     generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the
     $20,961 net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit associated
     with future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss
     carryforwards, prior to their expiration (primarily 12 years or more). This
     belief is based upon, among other factors, changes in operations over the
     last few years, management's focus on its business realignment activities
     and current business strategies primarily with respect to its U.K.
     operations. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of taxable income might
     affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. If this
     were to occur, management is committed to implementing tax planning
     strategies, such as the sale of net appreciated assets of the Company to
     the extent required (if any) to generate sufficient taxable income prior to
     the expiration of these benefits. Should such strategies be required, they
     could potentially result in the sale of a portion of the Company's interest
     in the U.K. operations and repatriation of such proceeds to the U.S.

     As of September 30, 2000, the Company has state net operating loss
     carryforwards of approximately $31,635 which, if unused, will expire in the
     years 2001 through 2015, and has a Federal net operating loss carryforward
     of approximately $30,660 which if unused, will expire in the years 2014
     through 2020. The Company has a capital loss carryforward of approximately
     $2,259 which, if unused, will expire in the years 2002 through 2005.

     Reconciliations of the differences between income taxes computed at Federal
     statutory tax rates and consolidated provisions for income taxes on income
     (loss) before equity income of and interest income earned from U.K.
     subsidiaries are as follows:

10.  INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED):

     (Loss) income before income taxes generated from the U.K. operations for
     the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $(2,046), $3,416, and
     $1,332, respectively. On a pro forma basis, assuming the U.K. subsidiaries
     had been consolidated for the entire fiscal year ended September 30, 2000,
     the loss generated from the U.K. Operations would have been $(965).

     The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
     "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." In accordance with SFAS No. 123,
     the Company continues to apply APB No. 25 and related Interpretations to
     account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method for
     its stock option plans and, accordingly, does not recognize compensation
     expense. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation expense based
     on the fair value of the options at grant date as prescribed by SFAS No.
     123, net (loss) income and net (loss) earnings per share would have been
     adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below:

11.  STOCK OPTION PLAN AND WARRANTS (CONTINUED):

     The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant
     using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
     assumptions:


                                  2000            1999             1998

     The compensation cost as generated by the Black-Scholes option-pricing
     model, may not be indicative of the future benefit, if any, that may be
     received by the option holder.


12.  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN:

     In January, 2000, TW UK adopted a management incentive plan (the "UK
     Plan"). Under the UK Plan, a new class of redeemable shares (having a
     nominal value of 0.01p) in the capital of TW UK was created (the
     "Redeemable Shares"), which are redeemable in the manor described below.
     Pursuant to the UK Plan 9,800 Redeemable Shares are reserved for issuance.
     Under the UK Plan the Redeemable shares may be issued at their nominal
     value and with an option price set by the board of directors of TW UK (the
     " Initial Value"). On March 7, 2000 TW UK issued 3,500, 1,800 and 4,200
     Redeemable Shares, with an Initial Value of 105p per share, to Mr. Aitken,
     Ms. Eames and various employees and members of management of TW UK and its
     subsidiaries, respectively. On July 10, 2000, 120 additional Redeemable
     Shares were issued to a member of management of TW UK and its subsidiaries
     with an Initial Value of 125p per share. The redemption rights attached to
     the Redeemable Shares are exercisable at any time during the period
     commencing on the date of a qualified public offering in the UK and ending
     10 years from the date of issuance. The net effect of the exercise of
     redemption rights is that the holder acquires ordinary shares of TW UK at a
     price per ordinary share equal to the Initial Value. The Redeemable Shares
     do not carry any dividend or income rights and do not carry any right to
     vote at general meetings of TW UK. All terms associated with the shares are
     fixed and the market value of an ordinary share of TW UK was less than the
     Initial Values of 105p and 125p therefore no compensation expense has been
     recognized.


13.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

     EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS:

     The Company has two employment agreements with certain of its executive
     officers which provide for minimum aggregate annual compensation of $425 in

     2001 minimum aggregate compensation. The agreement contains customary
     termination and non-compete provisions and a change in control provision
     that would entitle the individual up to 2.9 times of his salary then in

     employee to a severance payment equal to one year's salary, $325 as of
     October 1, 2000, plus relocation expenses.

     The Company has a performance based bonus plan for the Company's executive
     officers and certain other employees. Under this plan, amounts may be
     granted up to 50% of their base salaries at the sole discretion of the
     Compensation Committee. Bonuses may be paid in whole or in part, in cash or
     shares of common stock.

     OPERATING LEASES:

     The Company has entered into various operating lease agreements for office
     space and equipment. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options
     with extension dates in fiscal 2008 and 2013.

     Future minimum rental commitments required under operating leases that have
     non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of September 30, 2000
     are as follows:


               2001                           $1,471
               2002                            1,163

               2005                              519
               Thereafter                      1,828
                                             -------

                                              ======


     Rent expense under non-capitalized, non-cancelable lease agreements for the
     years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 amounted to $2,871, $2,431
     and $2,320, respectively.

     CONTINGENCIES:

     On August 20, 1999, TNI was named a defendant in a suit brought by Teresa
     Crutcher, in New Jersey state court, as administrator of the estate of
     Aaron Pernell, who was an infant and Teresa Crutcher's son. The claim is
     for wrongful death of Aaron Pernell alleged to have been caused by the
     negligent manner in which a TNI home care nurse placed him in an infant car
     seat. The case was settled on December 27, 1999 for $325 and was paid on
     December 29, 1999 by the Company's insurance carrier. Since this settlement
     was within the policy limits of the Company's insurance policies, it did
     not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash
     flows, or results of operations.

     On April 13, 1998, a shareholder of the Company, purporting to sue
     derivatively on behalf of the Company, commenced a derivative suit in the
     Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, entitled Kevin
     Mak, derivatively and on behalf of Transworld Healthcare, Inc., Plaintiff,
     vs. Timothy Aitken, Scott A. Shay, Lewis S. Ranieri, Wayne Palladino and
     Hyperion Partners II L.P., Defendants, and Transworld Healthcare, Inc.,
     Nominal Defendant, Index No. 98-106401. The suit alleges that certain
     officers and directors of the Company, and HPII, breached fiduciary duties
     to the

13.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED):

     Company and its shareholders, in connection with a transaction, approved by
     a vote of the Company's shareholders on March 17, 1998, in which the
     Company was to issue certain shares of stock to HPII in exchange for the
     HMI Receivables (Note 7). The action seeks injunctive relief against this
     transaction, and damages, costs and attorneys' fees in unspecified amounts.
     The transaction subsequently closed and the plaintiff has, on numerous
     occasions, stipulated to extend the defendants' time to respond to this
     suit. The most recent stipulation provides for an extension to January 12,
     2001.

     On July 11 and July 22, 1997, the Company's RespiFlow, Inc. ("RespiFlow")
     and MK Diabetic Support Services, Inc. ("MK") subsidiaries, respectively,
     each received a letter (the "Audit Letters") from the U.S. Department of
     Health and Human Services' Office of Audit Services, a division of the
     Office of Inspector General ("OIG"). The Company was subsequently informed
     that the Audit Letters cover its DermaQuest subsidiary. The Company has
     produced certain documents and provided related information to the OIG and
     to the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas regarding these
     subsidiaries' financial relationships with suppliers of durable medical
     equipment and various other practices including the subsidiaries' practices
     regarding the collection of coinsurance and deductible amounts due from
     Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, on November 19, 1997, the Company was
     notified by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas that the
     Company, RespiFlow, MK, and various other non-affiliated entities had been
     named defendants in a qui tam action under the Federal False Claims Act.
     The relator is a private party who has brought action on behalf of the
     Federal government. The Company entered into settlement discussions with
     the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and OIG in an effort to bring closure to
     this matter and to avoid the expense, disruption and uncertainty of
     litigation. The counsel for the relator was involved in these settlement
     discussions. On August 4, 2000, a final settlement was reached with the
     DOJ, the OIG and the relator in the amount of $10,000. In addition,
     pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company has agreed to pay the
     relator $82 covering reasonable expenses and attorney's fees and costs. In
     return, the United States has agreed to release the Company, certain
     subsidiaries, as well as its present and former owners, officers,
     directors, employees, and certain others, from any civil or administrative
     monetary claim for the various allegations being settled in this matter. In
     addition, the OIG has agreed not to exclude the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries from future participation in any federal health care program
     as a result of this matter. The Company has also agreed to a corporate
     integrity agreement with the OIG.

     In addition to its settlement with the federal government, the Company also
     has reached a final settlement with the prior owners of RespiFlow, MK and
     related subsidiaries (the "Prior Owners") in connection with an ongoing
     dispute with such persons. The Prior Owners paid the Company $5,000 to
     settle all outstanding issues between the relevant parties. In a related
     agreement the Company has guaranteed the Prior Owners a price of $5.00 per
     share for all shares of Company common stock they currently own (190) and
     still own on August 4, 2002. The Prior Owners are obligated to liquidate
     these shares on the open market for $5.00 per share or greater. To the
     extent that shares remain unliquidated on August 4, 2002, the difference
     between the closing price of the Company's common stock on August 4, 2002
     and $5.00 per share will be paid to the Prior Owners by the Company in
     cash.

13.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED):

     The Company has record a one-time charge of $5,082 related to the
     settlement of all of these matters in its third quarter of fiscal 2000.

     In addition to the above allegations, during the normal course of business,
     the Company continues to carefully monitor and review its submission of
     Medicare, Medicaid and all other claims for reimbursement. The Company
     believes that it is substantially in compliance, in all material respects,
     with the applicable provisions of the Federal statutes, regulations and
     laws and applicable state laws. Because of the broad and sometimes vague
     nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that an enforcement action
     will not be brought against the Company, or that the Company will not be
     found to be in violation of one or more of these provisions. At present,
     the Company cannot anticipate what impact, if any, subsequent
     administrative or judicial interpretation of the applicable Federal and
     state laws may have on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash
     flows or results of operations.

     Effective October 1, 1997, the Company owned 100% of the stock of HMI.

     On July 2, 1998, a former shareholder of HMI purporting to sue on behalf of
     a class of shareholders of HMI as of June 6, 1997, commenced a suit in the
     Delaware Chancery Court, New Castle County, entitled Kathleen S. O'Reilly
     v. Transworld HealthCare, Inc., W. James Nicol, Andre C. Dimitriadis, Dr.
     Timothy J. Triche and D. Mark Weinberg, Civil Action No. 16507-NC.
     Plaintiff alleged that the Company, as majority shareholder of HMI, and the
     then directors of HMI, breached fiduciary duties to the minority
     shareholders of HMI by approving a merger between HMI and a subsidiary of
     the Company for inadequate consideration. Plaintiff demands an accounting,
     damages, attorney's fees and other payment for other expenses for
     unspecified amounts. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action
     on September 18, 1998. The Court denied defendants' motion in part and
     granted the motion in part, leaving intact certain claims. Plaintiff has
     propounded discovery requests. The Company's insurer disclaims coverage as
     to the Company, however, the insurer for the Company's HMI subsidiary has
     accepted coverage for the individual defendant former HMI directors. The
     Company believes that it does not have liability and will vigorously defend
     this action. As such, the Company cannot predict whether the outcome of
     these actions will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
     consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

     By letter dated December 20, 1999, the Company received formal written
     notification of the intent of two plaintiffs to file a civil action in the
     Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania against Transworld
     Healthcare, Inc., Transworld Home Healthcare, Inc., Health Management, Inc.
     and HMI Pennsylvania, Inc. The two plaintiffs, Irwin Hirsch and Lloyd
     Myers, formerly were employees of HMI Pennsylvania, Inc., a subsidiary of
     the Company, and had written employment agreements. Myers also served as an
     officer of HMI. Based upon their former status as employees and as
     officers, both claim entitlement to contractual indemnification from HMI
     and HMI Pennsylvania, Inc. for defense costs and settlement of certain
     claims made against them. In 1994, Hirsch and Myers also sold two retail
     pharmacies they owned to HMI.

     Hirsch and Myers were named as defendants in an action filed in the United
     States District Court for

13.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED):


     the Eastern District of New York entitled In re Health Management, Inc.
     Securities Litigation, Master File No. 96 Civ. 0889 (ADS), which was a
     class action by shareholders of HMI alleging, among other claims against
     the defendants, fraud in connection with the valuation of certain
     securities. Hirsch and Myers incurred non-reimbursed legal expenses of $100
     in defending that litigation and, ultimately, settled their liability
     jointly for $1,325, which was non-reimbursed. They demand that defendants
     reimburse to them their non-reimbursed legal fees and the settlement amount
     pursuant to the indemnification provisions of their employee contracts.

     In addition to their indemnification claims, Hirsch and Myers also claim
     damages in the amount of $7,000 for losses in connection with the
     pharmacies sale transaction they entered into with HMI under which they
     sold their retail pharmacies to HMI. Hirsch and Myers claim that the
     pharmacies sale transaction was based upon fraudulent misrepresentations by
     HMI.

     The Company and HMI entities will vigorously defend against these claims.
     The Company believes that Hirsch and Myers' indemnification claims should
     not have any real merit because of testimony given by Hirsch and Myers
     under oath in connection with a criminal trial against Clifford Hotte, a
     director and former officer of HMI. In their testimony, Hirsch and Myers
     acknowledged malfeasance and nonfeasance, which should render their
     contractual entitlement to indemnification void. Even if they are entitled
     to indemnification despite their acknowledgements, they are liable to
     defendants for the economic losses and damages suffered by defendants as a
     result of the malfeasance and nonfeasance. Therefore if the civil actions
     are filed, the Company and HMI entities will aggressively pursue
     counterclaims against Hirsch and Myers for damages which, conservatively,
     are far in excess of their claims, including the claims associated with the
     pharmacies sale transaction.

     The enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
     "Commission") has issued a formal order of investigation relating to
     matters arising out of HMI's public announcement on February 27, 1996 that
     HMI would have to restate its financial statements for prior periods as a
     result of certain accounting irregularities. HMI is fully cooperating with
     this investigation and has responded to the requests of the Commission for
     documentary evidence.

     The outcomes of certain of the foregoing lawsuits and the investigation
     with respect to HMI are uncertain and the ultimate outcomes could have a
     material adverse affect on the Company.

     Some of the Company's subsidiaries are Medicare Part B suppliers who submit
     claims to the designated carrier who is the government's claims processing
     administrator. From time to time, the carrier may request an audit of
     Medicare Part B claims on a prepayment or postpayment basis. Some of the
     Company's subsidiaries currently have pending such audits. If the outcome
     of any audit results in a denial or a finding of an overpayment, then the
     affected subsidiary has appeal rights. Some of the subsidiaries currently
     are responding to these audits and pursuing appeal rights in certain
     circumstances.

     The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings and claims
     incidental to its normal business activities. The Company is vigorously
     defending its position in all such proceedings. Management believes these
     matters should not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated
     financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

     operations; (ii) U.S. specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals and medical
     supplies operations ("Mail-Order"); and (iii) U.S. hi-tech operations
     ("Hi-Tech"). The U.K. operations derive revenues from nursing and
     para-professional services, mail-order of ostomy, continence and wound care

     Mail-Order operations derives its revenues from mail-order of diabetic test
     strips and glucose monitors, respiratory, diabetic, maintenance and other
     commonly prescribed medications, as well as ostomy and orthotic products.
     The Mail-Order operations provide products to patients in their home
     nationwide and Puerto Rico. The Hi-Tech operations derive revenues from
     infusion and respiratory therapy services and home medical equipment
     operations concentrated in New Jersey and New York.

     During the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company also operated a U.S.
     nursing operation, TNI ("Nursing") which provided professional nursing and
     para-professional services in New Jersey and Florida. This operation was
     sold in July 1998.

     The Company uses differences in geographic areas, as well as in products
     and services to identify the reportable segments. The Company evaluates
     performance and allocates resources based on profit and loss from
     operations before corporate expenses, interest and income taxes. The
     accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those
     described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Inter segment
     sales are not material. The following table presents certain financial
     information by reportable business segments and geographic areas of
     operations for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998.

     for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
