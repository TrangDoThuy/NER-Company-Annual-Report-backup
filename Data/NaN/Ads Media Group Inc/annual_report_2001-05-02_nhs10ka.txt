                        INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of National Health & Safety
Corporation (a development stage company) as of December 31, 2000 and the
related statements of operations, stockholders' deficiency and cash flows for
the year ended December 31, 2000 and from the inception of the development
stage on January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2000.  The balance sheet,
statements of operations, stockholders' deficiency and cash flows of National
Health & Safety Corporation for the year ended December 31, 1999 were audited
by other auditors whose report dated January 18, 2000, included an
explanatory paragraph describing conditions that raised substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted auditing
standards.   Those standards require that we plan and perform  the  audit  to
obtain reasonable  assurance  about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit  includes  examining,  on  a  test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An  audit  also   includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant estimates  made  by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all  material  respects,  the  financial position of National Health & Safety
Corporation (a development stage  company)  as  of  December 31, 2000 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the  year ended December 31,
2000  and  from  the inception of the development stage on  January  1,  1999
through December 31,  2000,  in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

The accompanying financial statements  have  been  prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed  in  Notes 1 and 3, on
July 1, 1999, the Company filed a Voluntary Petition for Relief under Chapter
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The  filing was made necessary by a
lack  of  sufficient  liquidity.  The Company, has experienced recurring  net
losses.   Additionally,  as  of  December   31,   2000,  the  Company  had  a
stockholders'  deficit of $4,902,676.  These matters  raise substantial doubt
about  the  Company's  ability  to continue as a going concern.  Management's
plans in regard to these matters  are  partially  described in Notes 1 and 3.
The accompanying financial statements do not include  any adjustment relating
to  the recoverability and classification of asset carrying  amounts  or  the
amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               DECEMBER 31, 2000


NOTE 1    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS

          a.  Nature of Organization

          The Company  was  incorporated  on  March  23,  1989.   The Company's
          principal  business  activities  consist  of  providing medical  cost
          containment services to both institutional and consumer markets.  The
          Company  performs  on-going  credit  evaluations  of  its  customers'
          financial condition and generally requires no collateral.

          On  March  22,  1993  the  Company entered into a merger  with  State
          Policeman Annual Magazine, Inc.  (State),  whereby  each share of the
          Company's common and preferred stock was exchanged for  one share, of
          State's  common  and  preferred stock.  State is a Company which  was
          organized under the laws  of  the  State  of  Utah  on  May 14, 1983.
          Pursuant  to  the  merger  agreement,  State amended its Articles  of
          Incorporation  to  change  its  name  to  National  Health  &  Safety
          Corporation.  The Company entered the development stage on January 1,
          1999  per SFAS No. 7 because of the bankruptcy  proceedings  and  the
          sale of the Company's assets.

          On July  1, 1999, National Health & Safety Corporation (the "Debtor")
          filed  a  petition  for  relief  under  Chapter  11  of  the  federal
          bankruptcy laws in the United states bankruptcy Court for the Eastern
          District of  Pennsylvania,  Case  No.:99-18339.   Under  Chapter  11,
          certain claims against the Debtor in existence prior to the filing of
          the petitions for relief under the federal bankruptcy laws are stayed
          while     the     Debtor    continues    business    operations    as
          debtor-in-possession.   These claims are reported in the December 31,
          2000  balance  sheet as "pre-petition  accruals"  in  the  amount  of
          $4,344,951.  Claims  secured  against  the  Debtor's assets ("secured
          claims") also are stayed, although the holders  of  such  claims have
          the right to move the Court for relief from the stay.  Secured claims
          amounted to $1,473,141 at December 31, 2000.  On August 21, 2000, the
          Company filed the Fourth Amended Disclosure Statement with respect to
          the Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan")  for its
          consideration  by  the  Company's  creditors  and  shareholders,  and
          ultimate approval by the Bankruptcy Court.

          On November 27, 2000 the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan, and the
          Plan was implemented effective January 22, 2001 (See Note 8).

          b.   Accounts Receivable

          Accounts  receivable  are  shown  net  of  an  allowance for doubtful
          accounts of $8,200. Bad debts are written off in  the period in which
          they are deemed uncollectible.  Any bad debts subsequently  recovered
          are  recorded  as  income  in  the financial statements in the period
          during which they are recovered.

NOTE 1    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS
          (CONTINUED)

          c. Property and Equipment

          Property and equipment are stated  at cost.  Depreciation is provided
          using  accelerated  and straight-line  methods,  over  the  estimated
          useful life of each class of asset as follows:

                      Furniture and Fixtures               7 years
                      Office Equipment                     7 years
                      Computers                            5 years

          Expenditures  for repairs, maintenance and minor renewals are charged
          against income  as  incurred  and expenditures for major renewals and
          betterment are capitalized.  The cost and accumulated depreciation of
          assets sold or retired are removed  from the respective accounts with
          any  gain  or  loss on disposal reflected  in  income.   Depreciation
          expense was $-0- and $2,078 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and
          1999, respectively.  All  of  the  property and equipment was sold in
          July 1999.

          d. Basic Loss per Share of Common Stock

                                  For the Year Ended
                                  December 31, 2000
          ----------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Loss          Shares     Per Share
                                (Numerator)  (Denominator)  Amount

          Net loss              $(269,293)    59,008,459   $(.005)


                                  For the Year Ended
                                  December 31, 2000
          ----------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Loss          Shares     Per Share
                                (Numerator)  (Denominator)  Amount

          Net loss              $(2,198,736)  57,734,638   $ (.04)


          Basic loss per common share has been calculated based on the weighted
          average  number  of  shares  of  common  stock outstanding during the
          period.

          e. Cash Equivalents

          The Company considers all highly liquid investments  with  a maturity
          of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               DECEMBER 31, 2000


NOTE 1    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS
          (Continued)

          f.  Provision for Taxes

          At   December   31,   2000,   the  Company  had  net  operating  loss
          carryforwards of approximately $10,950,000 that may be offset against
          future taxable income through 2018.  No tax benefit has been reported
          in  the  financial  statements,  because  the  Company  believes  the
          carryforwards  may expire unused.   Accordingly,  the  potential  tax
          benefits  of  the  loss  carryforwards  are  offset  by  a  valuation
          allowance of the same amount.

          g. Estimates

          The preparation  of financial statements in conformity with generally
          accepted accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
          and  assumptions that affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and
          liabilities  and  disclosure  of contingent assets and liabilities at
          the date of the financial statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of
          revenues  and  expenses  during the reporting period.  Actual results
          could differ from those estimates.

          h. Revenue Recognition

          The Company has not yet established  ongoing  operations.   A revenue
          recognition   policy  will  be  established  when  planned  principal
          operations commence.

          i. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

          In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
          Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" which requires
          companies to record derivatives as assets or liabilities, measured at
          fair market-value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in the
          values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the
          use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.
          The key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging
          relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes
          in fair value or cash flows. SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal
          quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. Management
          believes the adoption of this statement will have no material impact
          on the Company's financial statements.

NOTE 1    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS
          (CONTINUED)

          j. Bankruptcy Accounting

          Since the Chapter  11  bankruptcy filing, the Company has applied the
          provisions in Statement  of Position (SOP) 90-7 " Financial Reporting
          by Entities in Reorganization  Under  the Bankruptcy Code."  SOP 90-7
          does not change the application of accepted  accounting principles in
          the  preparation of statements.  However, it does  require  that  the
          financial  statements  for periods including and subsequent to filing
          the Chapter 11 petition  distinguish transactions and events that are
          directly  associated  with  the   reorganization   from  the  ongoing
          operations of the business.

NOTE 2    RESTRICTED CASH

          Pursuant  to  the bankruptcy proceedings, the Company  has  one  cash
          account which has been attached by creditors or allocated for certain
          debt payments totaling  $14,212  at  December 31, 2000.  This cash is
          being presented as restricted cash because  the Company does not have
          full access to this account.

NOTE 3    GOING CONCERN

          The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
          concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
          satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The
          Company has a working capital deficiency of $ 4,896,888, an
          accumulated deficit of $ 14,443,802 as of December 31, 2000, and a
          net loss for the year then ended of $269,293.  Accordingly, its
          ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on obtaining
          capital and financing for its planned marketing and distribution of
          the POWERx memberships through the Company's benefits network.  The
          Company plans to secure financing for its acquisition strategy
          through the sale of its equity or issuance of debt.  However, there
          is no assurance that they will be successful in their efforts to
          raise capital or secure other financing.  These factors among others
          may indicate that the Company will be unable to continue as a going
          concern for a reasonable period of time.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               DECEMBER 31, 2000


NOTE 6    REORGANIZATION ITEMS

          Although the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing raises substantial doubt
          about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, the
          accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
          concern basis.  This basis contemplates the continuity of operating
          realization of assets, and discharge of liabilities in the ordinary
          course of business.  The statements also present the assets of the
          Company at historical cost, and the current intention that they will
          be realized as a going concern and in the normal course of business.

NOTE 7    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

          Under  the  Plan,  the  Company  was advanced  $255,750  by  Medsmart
          Healthcare Network, Inc., a related  party.   This amount is shown in
          the financial statements as post petition notes payable.  No interest
          accrues  on  this  note,  and  is  to  be  repaid once  the  Plan  is
          implemented.

NOTE 8    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

          The Plan was confirmed on November 27, 2000 and filed as an exhibit
          to the Company's Form 8-K, dated November 28, 2000, that reported the
          confirmation.  On January 22, 2001 the Plan was implemented, whereby
          the former shareholders of MedSmart Healthcare Network, Inc.
          ("MedSmart")  exchanged all of their MedSmart stock for a majority of
          the outstanding common stock of the Company.  MedSmart became a
          wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. This exchange, together with
          the contribution of $600,000 by the Co-Proponent of the Plan and
          other investors implemented the Plan and resulted in a change of
          control of the Company.

          Holders of the Company's 14,363 shares of Preferred  Stock  exchanged
          their shares for 600,000 shares of new Preferred Stock, Series B.

          Pursuant to and effective upon implementation of the Plan, January
          22, 2001, the Company authorized and issued certain new classes of
          securities as follows:

               The Company authorized the issuance of 500,000,000 common
               shares, par value $.001 and the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of
               preferred stock, which may consist of one or more series.
               Cumulative voting of any shares of stock, whether common or
               preferred, shall be prohibited.
