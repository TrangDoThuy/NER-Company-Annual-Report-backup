<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a Delaware-chartered bank holding
company which conducts business through its two wholly-owned bank subsidiaries, The Adams National
Bank (&#147;ANB&#148;) and Consolidated Bank &#038; Trust Company (&#147;CBT&#148;) (collectively, the &#147;Banks&#148;). ANB serves
the nation&#146;s capital through six full-service offices located in Washington, D.C. and Maryland. CBT
serves the Richmond and Hampton, Virginia market areas through three full service offices. The
Company is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
&#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;) and ANB is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. CBT
is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the
Commonwealth of Virginia (&#147;Bureau of Financial Institutions&#148;). The Company&#146;s assets consist
primarily of its ownership in the shares of the Banks&#146; common stock and cash it receives from the
Banks in the form of dividends or other capital distributions. At December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company
had consolidated assets of $343.0&nbsp;million, deposits of $292.0&nbsp;million and stockholders&#146; equity of
$28.1&nbsp;million. The Banks exceed all applicable regulatory capital requirements. See &#147;Supervision
and Regulation.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANB was founded in 1977 as a national bank. CBT was founded in 1903 as a Virginia chartered
commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Both Banks&#146; deposits are federally
insured to the maximum amount permitted by law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;29, 2005, the Company acquired CBT as a wholly-owned subsidiary by an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated February&nbsp;10, 2005 for approximately $2.5&nbsp;million. Pursuant to the agreement,
CBT shareholders received 0.534 shares of Company common stock for each of their CBT shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive office of the Company is located at 1130 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20036. The telephone number is (202)&nbsp;772-3600.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks draw most of their customer deposits and conduct most of their lending activities
from and within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region, including suburban Virginia and Maryland
along with Richmond and Hampton, Virginia. The Washington, D.C. and Richmond metropolitan markets
attract a significant number of businesses of all sizes, professional corporations and national
nonprofit organizations. The Banks actively solicit banking relationships with these firms and
organizations, as well as their professional staff, and with the significant population of high net
worth individuals who live and work in these regions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Services of the Bank</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks are community-oriented financial institutions offering a full range of banking
services to their customers. The Banks attract deposits from the general public and historically
have used such deposits, together with other funds to provide a broad level of commercial and
retail banking services in Washington, D.C., Richmond, Hampton and the surrounding communities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services offered by the Banks can be broadly characterized as being commercial or retail
in nature. Commercial services offered by the Banks include offering a variety of commercial real
estate and commercial business loans, cash management services, letters of credit and
collateralized repurchase agreements. Commercial business loans are typically made on a secured

consumer loans to their retail customers. The Banks&#146; retail banking services also include a variety
of deposit account products including transaction accounts, money market accounts, certificates of
deposit and Individual Retirement Accounts. The Banks use funds they have on hand, as well as
borrowings, in order to fund their lending and investment activities.

The Banks offer their customers traditional on-line banking services and 24 hour telephone banking.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Lending Activities</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks provide a range of commercial and retail lending services to individuals, small to
medium-sized businesses, professional corporations, nonprofit organizations and other
organizations. These services include, but are not limited to, commercial business loans,
commercial real estate loans, renovation and mortgage loans, SBA loans, loan participations,
consumer loans, revolving lines of credit and letters of credit. Consumer lending primarily
consists of personal loans made on a direct, secured basis. Real estate loans are originated
primarily for commercial purposes. To a lesser extent, the Banks originate construction loans. The
Banks offer loans which have fixed rates, as well as loans with rates which adjust periodically. At
December&nbsp;31, 2005, approximately $87.7&nbsp;million or 35.2% of the Banks&#146; total loan portfolio
consisted of loans with adjustable rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks provide financing to nonprofit organizations for construction and renovation of
local headquarters, working capital lines of credit and equipment financing. Current nonprofit
customers of the Banks include organizations which focus on issues relating to children&#146;s rights,
community housing, religion, education and health care.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial and real estate lending is performed by the ANB and CBT&#146;s Lending Divisions, which
are comprised of 15 loan officers, 11 of which are ANB loan officers. The loan support staff
includes the Loan Operations&#146; and Administration staff of 17, who are responsible for preparing
loan documents, recording and processing new loans and loan payments, ensuring compliance with
regulatory requirements, and working with the Lending Divisions, in order to ensure the timely
receipt of all initial and ongoing loan documentation and the prompt reporting of any exceptions.
Credit analysis on loans is performed by the individual loan officers, using a credit analysis
computer program, which provides not only the flexibility necessary to analyze loans but also the
structure to ensure that all documentation requirements are appropriately met.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policies and procedures have been established by the Banks to promote safe and sound lending.
ANB&#146;s loan officers have individual lending authorities based on the individual&#146;s seniority and
experience. Loans in excess of individual officers&#146; lending limits are presented to the Officers&#146;
Loan Committee (&#147;OLC&#148;), which meets weekly, and is comprised of all loan officers and the
President. The President of ANB has authority to approve unsecured loans up to $1.0&nbsp;million and
secured loans up to $2.0&nbsp;million. The OLC of ANB has authority to approve unsecured loans up to
$1.0&nbsp;million and secured loans up to $2.0&nbsp;million. Loans over $1.0&nbsp;million on an unsecured basis
and over $2.0&nbsp;million on a secured basis are brought to the Directors&#146; Loan Committee (&#147;DLC&#148;) of
ANB, which meets approximately twice per month. The DLC of ANB is comprised of six outside
directors. In addition to approving new loans, these Committees approve renewals, modifications
and extensions of existing loans and reviews past due problem loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DLC of CBT is comprised of four out of seven outside directors and has authority to
approve unsecured loans greater than $25,000 and secured loans greater than $50,000, up to the
legal lending limit. The Vice President of Credit Administration has authority to approve unsecured
loans ups to $25,000 and secured loans up to $50,000 thousand. The DLC of CBT meets approximately
twice per month.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For further information regarding the Banks&#146; loan portfolio composition, See
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Financial
Condition&#148; in the Annual Report to Shareholders filed as Exhibit&nbsp;13 to the Annual Report on Form
10-K and Note 5 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Commercial Business Lending</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks provide a wide range of commercial business loans, including lines of credit for
working capital purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes. In
most cases, the Banks have collateralized these loans and/or taken personal guarantees to help
assure repayment. Collateral for these loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory,
equipment and real estate. Terms of commercial business loans generally range from one year to
five years. These loans often require that borrowers maintain deposits with the Banks as
compensating balances. Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than
residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with
residential, commercial and multi-family real estate lending. Although commercial business loans
are often collateralized by real estate, equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other
business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often not a
sufficient source of repayment, because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories
and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use. The primary repayment risk for commercial loans is
the failure of the business due to economic or financial factors. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005,
commercial loans totaled $39.9&nbsp;million, the largest of which had a principal balance of $4.0
million, and at December&nbsp;31, 2005 was performing in accordance with its terms.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks also offer Small Business Administration (&#147;SBA&#148;) guaranteed loans, which provide
better terms and more flexible repayment schedules than conventional financing. SBA loans are
guaranteed up to a maximum of 85% of the loan&#146;s balance. As lending requirements of small
businesses grow to exceed either Bank&#146;s lending limit, the Banks have the ability to sell
participations in these larger loans to other financial institutions on a servicing retained basis.
The Banks believe that such participations will help to preserve lending relationships while
providing a high level of customer service. At December&nbsp;31, 2005, SBA-guaranteed loans totaled $7.0
million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Real Estate Lending</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Banks&#146; real estate loan portfolio consisted of commercial real
estate mortgages totaling $124.6&nbsp;million, and residential real estate mortgages totaling $48.5
million. Commercial real estate loans are generally for terms of five years and amortize over a
15- and 25-year period. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 80%
loan to value of the underlying collateral. In underwriting commercial real estate loans, the
Banks consider the borrower&#146;s overall creditworthiness and capacity to service debt, secondary
sources or repayment and any additional collateral or credit enhancements. Our largest commercial
real estate loan had a principal balance of $4.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005 and was secured by
first deed of trust. At December&nbsp;31, 2005 this loan was performing in accordance with its terms.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residential real estate loans are generally for terms of five years, amortize over a 25&nbsp;year
period, with a balloon payment at the term end. Residential real estate loans are generally
originated in amounts up to 80% loan to value of the underlying collateral. Our largest
residential real estate loan had a principal balance of $4.0&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2005. At December&nbsp;31, 2005 this loan was performing in accordance with its
terms. The underwriting for a residential real estate loan is the same as for a commercial real
estate loan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the $33.8&nbsp;million in construction and land development loans at December&nbsp;31,
2005 are primarily for construction and renovation of commercial real estate properties.
Construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than
long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Multi-family and commercial real estate
lending involves significant additional risks, as compared to one- to four-family residential
lending. For example, such loans typically involve large loans to single borrowers or related
borrowers. The payment experience on such loans is typically dependent on the successful operation
of the project, and these risks can be significantly affected by the supply and demand conditions
in the market for commercial property and multi-family residential units. To minimize these risks,
the Banks limit the aggregate amount of outstanding construction loans to one borrower, and
generally make such loans only in their market area and to borrowers with which the Banks have
substantial experience or who are otherwise well known to the Banks. It is the Banks&#146; current
practice to obtain personal guarantees and current financial statements from all principals
obtaining commercial real estate loans. The Banks also obtain appraisals on each property in
accordance with applicable regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Consumer Lending</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks&#146; consumer lending includes loans for motor vehicles, and small personal credit
lines. Consumer loans generally involve more risk than residential real estate mortgage and
commercial real estate loans. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an
adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of damage, loss or
depreciation, and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection
efforts against the borrower. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#146;s
continuing financial stability. Further, the application of various federal and state laws,
including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be
recovered. In underwriting consumer loans, the Banks consider the borrower&#146;s credit history, an
analysis of the borrower&#146;s income, expenses and ability to repay the loan and the value of the
collateral. At December&nbsp;31, 2005, consumer loans totaled $2.1&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Delinquencies and Classified Assets</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Collection Procedures. </I>Outstanding loans are reviewed on a weekly basis. When a loan becomes
10&nbsp;days past due, loan officers attempt to contact the borrower. Generally, loans that are 30&nbsp;days
delinquent will receive a default notice from the Banks. With respect to consumer loans, the Banks
will commence efforts to repossess the collateral after the loan becomes 30&nbsp;days delinquent.
Generally, after 90&nbsp;days the Banks will commence legal action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Loans Past Due and Nonperforming Assets</I>. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed
on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is
doubtful. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is 90&nbsp;days or
more past due. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on a nonaccrual status is
reversed from interest income. At December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Banks had nonperforming assets of
$580,000 and a ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets of 0.17%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Allowance for Loan Losses</I>. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision
for loan losses based on management&#146;s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and
current economic conditions. Such evaluation also includes a review of all loans on which full
collectibility may not be reasonably assured, including among other matters, the estimated net
realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical
loan loss experience, geographic concentrations and other factors that warrant recognition in
providing for an adequate loan loss allowance. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an
integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Banks&#146; allowance for loan
losses and valuation of other real estate owned. Such agencies may require us to recognize
additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time
of their examination. At December&nbsp;31, 2005, the total allowance was $4.3&nbsp;million, which amounted
to 1.75% of total loans and 759% of nonperforming assets. Management considers whether the
allowance should be adjusted to protect against risks in the loan portfolio. Management will
continue to monitor and modify the level of the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain it
at a level which management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates, personalized services, the
quality and range of financial services, convenience of office locations and office hours.
Competition for deposits comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings associations, credit
unions, money market funds and other investment alternatives. The primary factors in competing for
loans are interest rates, loan origination fees, the quality and range of lending services and
personalized services. Competition for loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings
associations, mortgage banking firms, credit unions and other financial intermediaries. The Banks
face competition for deposits and loans throughout their market areas not only from local
institutions but also from out-of-state financial intermediaries which have opened loan production offices or which solicit
deposits in its market areas. Many of the financial intermediaries operating in the Banks&#146; market
areas offer certain services, such as trust<B>, </B>investment and international banking services, which
the Banks do not offer. Additionally, banks with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries
not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to
serve the needs of larger customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compete with other financial services providers, the Banks principally rely upon
local promotional activities, personal relationships established by officers, directors and

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commercial banking business is not only affected by general economic conditions but is
also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of
regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board implements
national monetary policies by its open-market operations in U.S. Government securities, by
adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve
requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions.
The actions of the Federal Reserve Board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans,
investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The
nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board may require that the Company terminate an activity or terminate
control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries or affiliates when the Federal Reserve Board
believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk
to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries. The Federal
Reserve Board also has the authority to regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt,
including authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt. Under
certain circumstances, the Company must file written notice and obtain approval from the Federal
Reserve Board prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is prohibited by the BHCA, except in certain statutorily prescribed instances,
from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting
shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or
indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing
services to its subsidiaries. However, the Company, subject to the prior approval of the Federal
Reserve Board, may engage in any activities, or acquire shares of companies engaged in activities,
that are deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Additionally, bank holding companies that
elect to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in insurance, securities and, under
certain circumstances, merchant banking activities. The Company has not made the financial holding

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a
source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its
operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s policy
that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should
stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks
during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and
capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank
holding company&#146;s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its
subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and
unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s regulations or both. This
doctrine has become known as the &#147;source of strength&#148; doctrine. The validity of the source of
strength doctrine has been and is likely to continue to be the subject of litigation-until
definitively resolved by the courts or by Congress.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANB, as a national banking association, is subject to primary supervision, examination and
regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#147;OCC&#148;). If, as a result of an
examination of ANB, the OCC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset
quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of the ANB&#146;s operations are
unsatisfactory or that ANB or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation,
various remedies are available to the OCC. Such remedies include the power to enjoin &#147;unsafe or
unsound practices,&#148; to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any
violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice, to issue an administrative order that can be
judicially enforced, to direct an increase in capital, to restrict the growth of ANB, to assess
civil monetary penalties, and to remove officers and directors. The FDIC has similar enforcement
authority, in addition to its authority to terminate a bank&#146;s deposit insurance, in the absence of
action by the OCC and upon a finding that a bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition, is engaging
in unsafe or unsound activities, or that its conduct poses a risk to the deposit insurance fund or
may prejudice the interest of its depositors. ANB is not subject to any such actions by the OCC or
the FDIC.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CBT is a Virginia state bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, and its depositors
are insured by the FDIC. The Federal Reserve and the Virginia State Corporation Commission and its
Bureau of Financial Institutions regulate and monitor CBT&#146;s operations. CBT is required to file
with the Federal Reserve quarterly financial reports on the financial condition and performance of
the organization. The Federal Reserve and State conduct periodic onsite and offsite examinations of
CBT. CBT must comply with a wide variety of reporting requirements and banking regulations. The
laws and regulations governing CBT generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the
deposit insurance funds and not to protect various shareholders.

requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States affect the operations of the
Banks. Federal statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the Banks&#146; operations, including
reserves against deposits, interest rates payable on deposits, loans, investments, mergers and
acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of branch offices, capital requirements and
disclosure obligations to depositors and borrowers. Further, the Banks are required to maintain
certain levels of capital.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Banks. The Company&#146;s ability to
pay cash dividends is limited by Delaware corporate law. In addition, the prior approval of the
Banks&#146; primary regulator is required if the total of all dividends declared by the individual Banks
in any calendar year exceeds that bank&#146;s net income for the year combined with its retained net
profits for the preceding two years, less any transfers to surplus, that is still available for
dividends.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks&#146; regulators have authority to prohibit the Banks from engaging in activities that,
in the regulators opinion, constitute unsafe or unsound practices in conducting its business. It
is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question and other factors, that
the regulator could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might, under some
circumstances, be such an unsafe or unsound practice. Further, the OCC and the Federal Reserve
Board have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital
by banks or bank holding companies under their jurisdiction. Compliance with the standards set
forth in such guidelines and the restrictions that are or may be imposed under the prompt
corrective action provisions of federal law could limit the amount of dividends which the Banks or
the Company may pay.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of
credit to, or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of, the Company or other
affiliates, the purchase of or investments in stock or other securities thereof, the taking of such
securities as collateral for loans and the purchase of assets of the Company or other affiliates.
Such restrictions prevent the Company and such other affiliates from borrowing from the Banks,
unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts. Further, such
secured loans and investments by the Banks to or in the Company or to or in any other affiliate is
limited to 10% of the individual Bank&#146;s capital and surplus (as defined by federal regulations) and
such secured loans and investments are limited, in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank&#146;s capital and
surplus (as defined by federal regulations). Additional restrictions on transactions with
affiliates may be imposed on the Banks under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal
law.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Written Agreements</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;5, 2000, CBT entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Richmond and the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission,
which imposes certain requirements on CBT. A summary of the requirements follows: 1) develop a
strengthened management structure, including the employment of a permanent and full time chief
executive officer; 2) submit status reports on classified loans, charged-off loans, and maintain an
adequate and documented allowance for loan losses; 3) submit written plans for maintaining board
oversite and succession, maintaining capital, and maintaining updated policies; 4) obtain
regulatory approval for the payment of dividends to shareholders; and 5) develop oversite measures
for compliance programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;12, 2002, The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond issued a Capital Restoration directive.
CBT was directed to submit a capital restoration plan to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and
to meet certain restrictions, such as a restriction on asset growth; no expansion through
acquisitions; no new branches, no new lines of business; no bonuses or raises to senior officers,
no payment of dividends; and no payment of interest rates higher than other financial institutions
in central Virginia. The bank filed a detailed Capital Restoration Plan on July&nbsp;29, 2002 and again
on October&nbsp;24, 2003.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written agreement was updated with an amendment on July&nbsp;25, 2003. A summary of the
requirements follows: 1) employ a qualified senior credit administrator and internal auditor; 2)
increase the number of outside directors with banking experience; 3) place restrictions on
indemnification and severance payments; 4) submit an updated written plan to maintain sufficient
capital; 5) submit a plan to monitor and control concentrations of credit; 6) correct documentation

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Capital Standards</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC have adopted risk-based minimum capital guidelines
intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking
organization&#146;s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and
transactions, and those which are recorded as off balance sheet items. Under these guidelines,
nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are
multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low
credit risk, such as certain U.S. Treasury securities, to 100% for assets with relatively high
credit risk, such as business loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A banking organization&#146;s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying
capital by its total risk adjusted assets. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets, which
include off balance sheet items, against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital
and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital consists primarily of
common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (cumulative perpetual
preferred stock for bank holding companies) and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less
most intangible assets. Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for
possible loan and lease losses, cumulative preferred stock, long-term preferred stock, eligible
term subordinated debt and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity. The
inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of
the federal banking agencies. The federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of qualifying
total capital to risk-adjusted assets of 8% and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted
assets of 4%. In addition to the risk-based guidelines, federal banking regulators require banking
organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to total assets, referred to as the
leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under federal regulations, an institution is generally considered &#147;well capitalized&#148; if it has
a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%,
and a Tier I capital (leverage)&nbsp;ratio of at least 5%. Federal law generally requires full-scope
on-site annual examinations of all insured depository institutions by the appropriate federal bank
regulatory agency, although the examination may occur at longer intervals for small
well-capitalized or state chartered banks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current risk-based capital ratio analysis establishes minimum supervisory guidelines and
standards. It does not evaluate all factors affecting an organization&#146;s financial condition.
Factors which are not evaluated include (i)&nbsp;overall interest rate exposure; (ii)&nbsp;quality and level
of earnings; (iii)&nbsp;investment or loan portfolio concentrations; (iv)&nbsp;quality of loans and
investments; (v)&nbsp;the effectiveness of loan and investment policies; (vi)&nbsp;certain risks arising from
nontraditional activities and (vii)&nbsp;management&#146;s overall ability to monitor and control other
financial and operating risks, including the risks presented by concentrations of credit and
nontraditional activities. The capital adequacy assessment of federal bank regulators will,
however, continue to include analyses of the foregoing considerations and in particular, the level
and severity of problem and classified assets. Market risk of a banking organization&#151;risk of loss
stemming from movements in market prices&#151;is not evaluated under the current risk-based capital
ratio analysis (and is therefore analyzed by the bank regulators through a general assessment of an
organization&#146;s capital adequacy) unless trading activities constitute 10% of $1&nbsp;billion or more of
the assets of such organization. Such an organization (unless exempted by the banking regulators)
and certain other banking organization designated by the banking regulators must, beginning on or
before January&nbsp;1, 1998, include in its risk-based capital ratio analysis charges for, and hold
capital against, general market risk of all positions held in its trading account and of foreign
exchange and commodity positions wherever located, as well as against specific risk of debt and
equity positions located in its trading account. Currently, the Company does not calculate a
risk-based capital charge for its market risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital
recognized for purposes of capital adequacy. Such a change could affect the ability of the Banks
to grow and could restrict the amount of profits, if any, available for the payment of dividends.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve
the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below
one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. The law requires each federal banking agency to
promulgate regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository
institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well capitalized, adequately
capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as &#147;well capitalized,&#148;
&#147;adequately capitalized&#148; or &#147;undercapitalized&#148; may be treated as though it were in the next lower
capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants
such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is
subject to more restrictions. The federal banking agencies, however, may not treat an institution
as &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; unless its capital ratio actually warrants such treatment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to restrictions and sanctions imposed under the prompt corrective action
provisions, commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the
federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations
of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written
agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or
receiver, the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced, the termination
of insurance of deposits (in the case of a depository institution), the imposition of civil money
penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of formal and informal
agreements, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties
and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial
determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.

Bank Insurance Fund into a unified insurance deposit fund, an increase in the amount of federal
deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $130,000 (with a cost of living adjustment to become
effective in five years), and the reserve ratio to be modified to provide for a range between 1.15%

requires banks to assess and help meet the credit needs of the community in which the bank
operates. The OCC examines the Bank to determine its level of compliance with CRA and the Federal
Reserve Board examines CBT to determine its level of compliance with CRA. The OCC and the Federal

&#147;Interstate Act&#148;), a bank holding company that is adequately capitalized and managed may obtain
approval under the BHCA to acquire an existing bank located in another state generally without
regard to state law prohibitions on such acquisitions. A bank holding company, however, can not be
permitted to make such an acquisition if, upon consummation, it would control (a)&nbsp;more than 10% of
the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States or (b)&nbsp;30% or

intended to address corporate and accounting fraud. In addition to the establishment of a new
accounting oversight board that will enforce auditing, quality control and independence standards
and will be funded by fees from all publicly traded companies, Sarbanes-Oxley places certain
restrictions on the scope of services that may be provided by accounting firms to their public
company audit clients. Any non-audit services being provided to a public company audit client will
require preapproval by the company&#146;s audit committee. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley makes certain
changes to the requirements for audit partner rotation after a period of time. Sarbanes-Oxley
requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalent, to certify to
the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, subject to
civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willingly violate this certification requirement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarbanes-Oxley also increases the oversight of, and codifies certain requirements relating to
audit committees of public companies and how they interact with the company&#146;s &#147;registered public
accounting firm.&#148; Audit Committee members must be independent and are absolutely barred from
accepting consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer. In addition, companies
must disclose whether at least one member of the committee is a &#147;financial expert&#148; (as such term is
defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) and if not, why not. Under Sarbanes-Oxley, a
company&#146;s registered public accounting firm is prohibited from performing statutorily mandated
audit services for a company if such company&#146;s chief executive officer, chief financial officer,
comptroller, chief accounting officer or any person serving in equivalent positions had been
employed by such firm and participated in the audit of such company during the one-year period
preceding the audit initiation date. Sarbanes-Oxley also prohibits any officer or director of a
company or any other person acting under their direction from taking any action to fraudulently
influence, coerce, manipulate or mislead any independent accountant engaged in the audit of the
company&#146;s financial statements for the purpose of rendering the financial statements materially
misleading.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company&#146;s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $124.6
million, and commercial business loans totaled $39.9&nbsp;million. These two categories of loans
represent 66.2% of the Company&#146;s loan portfolio. The Company plans to continue its emphasis on the
origination of these types of loans. These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater
risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment
of the loans often depends on the successful operations and the income stream of the borrowers.
Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related
borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Also, many of the Company&#146;s
borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or commercial business loan outstanding with
the Company. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit
relationship can expose the Company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse
development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in Washington, D.C.
and to a lesser extent the Richmond and Hampton, Virginia market areas. Unlike larger banks that
are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to
customers primarily in Washington, D.C. The local economic conditions in the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area have a significant impact on its loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay
these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A significant decline in general
economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond the
Company&#146;s control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the
financial results of its banking operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company targets its business lending and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily
the banking and financial services needs of small to medium size businesses. These small to medium
size businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity
than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, the
Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Cover Actual Loan Losses, its Earnings Could Decrease.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans,
and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining
loan balance. The Company may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material
adverse effect on its operating results. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about
the collectibility of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the
value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of its
loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company relies on its
loan quality reviews, its experience and its evaluation of economic conditions, among other
factors. If the Company&#146;s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, its allowance for
credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses in its loan portfolio, resulting in additions
to its allowance. Material additions to its allowance would materially decrease its net income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s emphasis on continued diversification of its loan portfolio through the
origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans is one of the more significant
factors it takes into account in evaluating its allowance for credit losses and provision for
credit losses. As the Company further increases the amount of such types of loans in its
portfolio, the Company may determine to make additional or increased provisions for credit losses,
which could adversely affect its earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, bank regulators periodically review the Company&#146;s loan portfolio and credit
underwriting procedures as well as its allowance for credit losses and may require the Company to
increase its provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in
its allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities
could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial
condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Changes in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc.&#146;s
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by
changes in interest rates. The Company&#146;s results of operations depend substantially on its net
interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest-earning
assets and the interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities. At December&nbsp;31, 2005,
the Company&#146;s interest rate risk profile indicated that net interest income would increase in a
rising interest rate environment, but would decrease in a declining interest rate environment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in interest rates also affect the value of the Company&#146;s interest-earning assets, and
in particular the Company&#146;s securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities fluctuates
inversely with changes in interest rates. At December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company&#146;s available for sale
securities totaled $52.6&nbsp;million. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale
could have an adverse effect on stockholders&#146; equity or earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also is subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates.
Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities.
Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related
securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, the
Company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash
received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and
securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more
difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Strong Competition Within Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc.&#146;s Market Area May Limit its
Growth and Profitability.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In the Company&#146;s market
area, the Company competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms,
credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment
banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors (whether regional or
national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Company
does and may offer certain services that the Company does not or cannot provide. The Company&#146;s
profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market area.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. Operates in a Highly Regulated Environment and May Be
Adversely Affected By Changes in Laws and Regulations.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve
Board. ANB is subject to regulation by the OCC and by the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. CBT is
subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, the Bureau of Financial Institutions and by the
FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a
bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the
deposit insurance funds and depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in
connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition
of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank and the
evaluation of the adequacy of a bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation
and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a
material impact on the Company and its operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted a non-statutory stock option plan (2000 Stock Option Plan) on
February&nbsp;15, 2000 that was not submitted for approval to the shareholders. A total of 30,250 shares
of common stock were authorized for issuance to key employees and non-employee directors. All
options were granted at an exercise price of $5.21 per share, representing 90% of the fair market
value of the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of the grant. The options vested over three years
and expire after ten years from the date of grant. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, 19,662 options have
been exercised in the 2000 Stock Option Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a 1987 stock option plan providing for the award of non-statutory options to
purchase 170,156 shares of common stock. This plan was approved by stockholders. No options have
ever been awarded under this plan. The 1996 Employee Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Original
Directors Stock Option Plan, and the 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan were granted and fully
exercised in prior years.
