<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a Delaware-chartered bank holding
company which conducts business through its two wholly-owned bank subsidiaries, The Adams National
Bank (&#147;ANB&#148;) and Consolidated Bank &#038; Trust Company (&#147;CBT&#148;) (collectively, the &#147;Banks&#148;). ANB serves
the nation&#146;s capital through six full-service offices located in Washington, D.C. and Maryland. CBT
serves the Richmond and Hampton, Virginia market areas through three full service offices. The
Company is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
&#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;) and ANB is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. CBT
is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the
Commonwealth of Virginia (&#147;Bureau of Financial Institutions&#148;). The Company&#146;s assets consist
primarily of its ownership in the shares of the Banks&#146; common stock and cash it receives from the
Banks in the form of dividends or other capital distributions. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company
had consolidated assets of $423.7&nbsp;million, deposits of $347.0&nbsp;million and shareholders&#146; equity of
$24.3&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANB was founded in 1977 as a national bank. CBT was founded in 1903 as a Virginia chartered
commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Both Banks&#146; deposits are federally
insured to the maximum amount permitted by law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;29, 2005, the Company acquired CBT as a wholly-owned subsidiary by an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated February&nbsp;10, 2005 for approximately $3.0&nbsp;million. Pursuant to the agreement,
CBT shareholders received 0.534 shares of Company common stock for each of their CBT shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reports two operating segments comprised of its subsidiaries, ANB and CBT, for
which there is discrete financial information available. Both segments are engaged in providing
financial services in their respective market areas and are similar in each of the following: the
nature of their products, services; and processes; type or class of customer for their products and
services; methods used to distribute their products or provide their services; and the nature of
the banking regulatory environment. The Company is deemed to represent an overhead function rather
than an operating segment. For additional information on segment reporting, see Note 22 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive office of the Company is located at 1130 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20036. The telephone number is (202)&nbsp;772-3600.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by
Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc., Huntington, West Virginia. Pursuant to the agreement, each
shareholder of the Company will receive 0.4461 shares of Premier Financial common stock. The
entire transaction is valued at approximately $10.9&nbsp;million based upon Premier Financial&#146;s closing
price on December&nbsp;31, 2008. The transaction is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and
is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;1, 2008, the Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, The Adams National Bank (the
&#147;Bank&#148;) entered into a written agreement with its primary regulator, The Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (the &#147;OCC&#148;). Under the terms of the written agreement, the Bank has agreed to take
certain actions relating to the Bank&#146;s lending operations and capital compliance. Specifically,
the OCC is requiring the Bank to take certain enumerated actions. See &#147;Supervision and
Regulation&#151;Written Agreement&#148; for further information.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and
going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, on October&nbsp;3, 2008, the
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the &#147;EESA&#148;) was signed into law. EESA provides,
among other things, for a Troubled Assets Relief Program (&#147;TARP&#148;), under which the U.S. Department
of the Treasury has the authority to purchase up to $700&nbsp;billion of securities and certain other
financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing
liquidity to the U.S. financial markets.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;14, 2008, the Treasury Department announced a Capital Purchase Program (&#147;CPP&#148;)
under the TARP pursuant to which it would acquire equity investments, usually preferred stock, in
banks and thrifts and their holding companies. Participating financial institutions also were
required to adopt the Treasury Department&#146;s standards for executive compensation and corporate
governance for the period during which the department holds equity issued under the CPP. We have
not applied to receive an investment under the CPP.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;10, 2009, Treasury announced its Capital Assistance Program (&#147;CAP&#148;) under which
Treasury will make capital available to financial institutions through Treasury&#146;s purchase of
cumulative mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The preferred shares will mandatorily convert
to common stock after seven years. Prior to that time, the preferred shares are convertible in
whole or in part at the option of the institution, subject to the approval of the institution&#146;s
primary federal regulator. Institutions that have received an investment from Treasury under the
CPP may use proceeds from the CAP to redeem preferred shares issued in the CPP, effectively
exchanging the preferred stock sold under the CPP for CAP convertible preferred stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;22, 2008, the FDIC published a final rule that raises the current deposit
insurance assessment rates uniformly for all institutions by 7 basis points (to a range from 12 to
50 basis points) effective for the first quarter of 2009. On February&nbsp;27, 2009, the FDIC also
issued a final rule that revises the way the FDIC calculates federal deposit insurance assessment
rates beginning in the second quarter of 2009. Under the new rule, the total base assessment rate
will range from 7 to 77.5 basis points of the institution&#146;s deposits, depending on the risk
category of the institution and the institution&#146;s levels of unsecured debt, secured liabilities,
and brokered deposits. Additionally, the FDIC issued an interim rule that would impose a special
20 basis points assessment on June&nbsp;30, 2009, which would be collected on September&nbsp;30, 2009.
However, the FDIC has indicated a willingness to decrease the special assessment to 10 basis points
under certain circumstances concerning the overall financial health of the insurance fund. Special
assessments of 10 and 20 basis points would result in additional expense of approximately $293,000
to $586,000, respectively. The interim rule also allows for additional special assessments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;14, 2008, the FDIC announced the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (&#147;TLGP&#148;).
This program has two components. One guarantees newly issued senior unsecured debt of the
participating organizations, up to certain limits established for each institution, issued between
October&nbsp;14, 2008 and June&nbsp;30, 2009. The Company has opted not to participate in this component of
the TLGP. The other component of the program provides full FDIC insurance coverage for
non-interest bearing transaction deposit accounts, regardless of dollar amount, until December&nbsp;31,
2009. An annualized 10 basis point assessment on balances in noninterest-bearing transaction
accounts that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000 will be assessed on a
quarterly basis to insured depository institutions participating in this component of the TLGP.
The Company has chosen to participate in this component of the TLGP.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (&#147;ARRA&#148;), more commonly known as the
economic stimulus or economic recovery package, was signed into law on February&nbsp;17, 2009, by
President Obama. ARRA includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and
provide for extensive infrastructure, energy, health, and education needs. In addition, ARRA
imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and
future TARP recipients until the recipient has repaid the Treasury, which is now permitted under
ARRA without penalty and without the need to raise new capital, subject to the Treasury&#146;s
consultation with the recipient&#146;s appropriate regulatory agency.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks draw most of their customer deposits and conduct most of their lending activities
from and within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region, including suburban Virginia and Maryland
along with Richmond and Hampton, Virginia. The Washington, D.C. and Richmond metropolitan markets
attract a significant number of businesses of all sizes, professional corporations and national
nonprofit organizations. The Banks actively solicit banking relationships with these firms and
organizations, as well as their professional staff, and with the significant population of high net
worth individuals who live and work in these regions.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks are community-oriented financial institutions offering a full range of banking
services to their customers. The Banks attract deposits from the general public and historically
have used such deposits, together with other funds to provide a broad level of commercial and
retail banking services in Washington, D.C., Richmond, Hampton and the surrounding communities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services offered by the Banks can be broadly characterized as being commercial or retail
in nature. Commercial services offered by the Banks include offering a variety of commercial real
estate, construction, and commercial business loans, cash management services, letters of credit
and collateralized repurchase agreements. Commercial business loans are typically made on a
secured basis to corporations, partnerships and individual businesses. To a lesser extent, the
Banks offer consumer loans to their retail customers. The Banks&#146; retail banking services also
include a variety of deposit account products including transaction accounts, money market
accounts, certificates of deposit and Individual Retirement Accounts. The Banks use funds they
have on hand, as well as borrowings, in order to fund their lending and investment activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks have automated teller machine access to the STAR, AMEX, PLUS and CIRRUS systems.
The Banks offer their customers traditional on-line banking services and 24 hour telephone banking.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Lending Activities</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks provide a range of commercial and retail lending services to individuals, small to
medium-sized businesses, professional corporations, nonprofit organizations and other
organizations. These services include, but are not limited to, commercial business loans,
commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, renovation and mortgage loans,
SBA loans, loan participations, consumer loans, revolving lines of credit and letters of credit.
Consumer lending primarily consists of personal loans made on a direct, secured basis. Real estate
loans are originated primarily for commercial purposes. To a lesser extent, the Banks originate
construction loans. The Banks offer loans which have fixed rates, as well as loans with rates
which adjust periodically. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, approximately $101.0&nbsp;million or 31.1% of the
Banks&#146; total loan portfolio consisted of loans with adjustable rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks provide financing to nonprofit organizations for construction and renovation of
local headquarters, working capital lines of credit and equipment financing. Current nonprofit
customers of the Banks include organizations which focus on issues relating to children&#146;s rights,
community housing, religion, education and health care.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial and real estate lending is performed by the ANB and CBT Lending Divisions, which
are comprised of 13 loan officers, 9 of which are ANB loan officers. The loan support staff
includes the Loan Operations and Administration staff of 15, who are responsible for preparing loan
documents, recording and processing new loans and loan payments, ensuring compliance with
regulatory requirements, and working with the Lending Divisions, in order to ensure the timely
receipt of all initial and ongoing loan
documentation and the prompt reporting of any exceptions. Credit analysis on loans is
performed by the individual loan officers, using a credit analysis computer program, which provides
not only the flexibility necessary to analyze loans but also the structure to ensure that all
documentation requirements are appropriately met.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policies and procedures have been established by the Banks to promote safe and sound lending.
ANB&#146;s loan officers have individual lending authorities based on the individual&#146;s seniority and
experience. Loans in excess of individual officers&#146; lending limits are presented to the Officers&#146;
Loan Committee (&#147;OLC&#148;), which meets weekly, and is comprised of all loan officers and the
President. The President of ANB has authority to approve unsecured loans up to $1.0&nbsp;million and
secured loans up to $2.0&nbsp;million. The OLC of ANB has authority to approve unsecured loans up to
$1.0&nbsp;million and secured loans up to $2.0&nbsp;million. Loans over $1.0&nbsp;million on an unsecured basis
and over $2.0&nbsp;million on a secured basis are brought to the Directors&#146; Loan Committee (&#147;DLC&#148;) of
ANB, which meets approximately twice per month. The DLC of ANB is comprised of six outside
directors. In addition to approving new loans, these Committees approve renewals, modifications
and extensions of existing loans and reviews past due problem loans.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Commercial Business Lending</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks provide a wide range of commercial business loans, including lines of credit for
working capital purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes. In
most cases, the Banks have collateralized these loans and/or taken personal guarantees to help
assure repayment. Collateral for these loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory,
equipment and real estate. Terms of commercial business loans generally range from one year to
five years. These loans often require that borrowers maintain deposits with the Banks as
compensating balances. Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than
residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with
residential, commercial and multi-family real estate lending. Although commercial business loans
are often collateralized by real estate, equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other
business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often not a
sufficient source of repayment, because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories
and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use. The primary repayment risk for commercial loans is
the failure of the
business due to economic or financial factors. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, commercial loans
(including SBA guaranteed loans) totaled $43.7&nbsp;million, the largest of which had a principal
balance of $3.2&nbsp;million, and at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was performing in accordance with its terms.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks also offer Small Business Administration (&#147;SBA&#148;) guaranteed loans, which provide
better terms and more flexible repayment schedules than conventional financing. SBA loans are
guaranteed up to a maximum of 85% of the loan&#146;s balance. As lending requirements of small
businesses grow to exceed either Bank&#146;s lending limit, the Banks have the ability to sell
participations in these larger loans to other financial institutions on a servicing retained basis.
The Banks believe that such participations will help to preserve lending relationships while
providing a high level of customer service. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, SBA-guaranteed loans totaled $3.8
million.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Banks&#146; real estate loan portfolio consisted of commercial real
estate mortgages totaling $163.2&nbsp;million, and residential real estate mortgages totaling $54.9
million. Commercial real estate loans are generally for terms of five years and amortize over a
15- and 25-year period. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 80%
loan to value of the underlying collateral. In underwriting commercial real estate loans, the
Banks consider the borrower&#146;s overall creditworthiness and capacity to service debt, secondary
sources of repayment and any additional collateral or credit enhancements. Our largest commercial
real estate loan had a principal balance of $4.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and was secured by a
first deed of trust. At December&nbsp;31, 2008 this loan was performing in accordance with its terms.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residential real estate loans are generally originated for terms of five years, amortize over
a 25&nbsp;year period, with a balloon payment at the term end. Residential real estate loans are
generally originated in amounts up to 80% loan to value of the underlying collateral. Our largest
residential real estate loan had a principal balance of $4.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The
underwriting for a residential real estate loan is the same as for a commercial real estate loan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the $61.5&nbsp;million in construction and land development loans at December&nbsp;31,
2008 are primarily for construction and renovation of commercial real estate properties.
Construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than
long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Multi-family and commercial real estate
lending involves significant additional risks, as compared to one- to four-family residential
lending. For example, such loans typically involve large loans to single borrowers or related
borrowers. The payment experience on such loans is typically dependent on the successful
completion and subsequent operation of the project, and these risks can be significantly affected
by the supply and demand conditions in the market for commercial property and multi-family
residential units. To minimize these risks, the Banks limit the aggregate amount of outstanding
construction loans to one borrower, and generally make such loans only in their market area and to
borrowers with which the Banks have substantial experience or who are otherwise well known to the
Banks. It is the Banks&#146; current practice to obtain personal guarantees and current financial
statements from all principals obtaining commercial real estate loans. The Banks also obtain
appraisals on each property in accordance with applicable regulations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Consumer Lending</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks&#146; consumer lending includes loans for motor vehicles, and small personal credit
lines. Consumer loans generally involve more risk than residential real estate mortgage and
commercial real estate loans. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an
adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of damage, loss or
depreciation, and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection
efforts against the borrower. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#146;s
continuing financial stability. Further, the application of various federal and state laws,
including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be
recovered. In underwriting consumer loans, the Banks consider the borrower&#146;s credit history, an
analysis of the borrower&#146;s income, expenses and ability to repay the loan and the value of the
collateral. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, consumer loans totaled $1.6&nbsp;million.

10&nbsp;days past due, loan officers attempt to contact the borrower. Generally, loans that are 30&nbsp;days
delinquent will receive a default notice from the Banks. With respect to consumer loans, the Banks
will commence efforts to repossess the collateral after the loan becomes 30&nbsp;days delinquent.
Generally, after 90&nbsp;days the Banks will commence legal action.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Loans Past Due and Nonperforming Assets</I>. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed
on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is
doubtful. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is 90&nbsp;days or
more past due. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on a nonaccrual status is
reversed from interest income. Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90
days or more, and other real estate owned. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the
Banks had nonperforming assets of $37.9&nbsp;million and a ratio of nonperforming assets to total
assets of 8.95%. The increase in nonperforming assets is due to the general weakening of the
economic conditions and decline in real estate values in the markets served by the Company. The
increase in nonperforming loans is primarily attributable to our condominium and condo tenant
association construction and multi-family residential real estate loan portfolios, which
experienced deterioration in estimated collateral values and repayment abilities, where repayment
is dependent upon the sale of condominium units. To assist in identifying weakness in the real
estate loan portfolio, updated appraisals were ordered in the fourth quarter of 2008, and these
appraisals have shown a decrease in market values of real estate secured properties. In addition,
an independent loan review was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2008, to review all loans with
balances greater than $150,000. The results of the appraisal updates and the results of the
independent loan review were taken into account in increasing our provision for loan losses. The
loan loss reserve is the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate
level to absorb probable loan losses. To address the increase in the nonperforming loans, the
provision for loan losses was $11.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Allowance for Loan Losses</I>. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision
for loan losses based on management&#146;s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and
current economic conditions. Such evaluation also includes a review of all loans on which full
collectibility may not be reasonably assured, including among other matters, the estimated net
realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical
loan loss experience, geographic concentrations and other factors that warrant recognition in
providing for an adequate loan loss allowance. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an
integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Banks&#146; allowance for loan
losses and valuation of other real estate owned. Such agencies may require us to recognize
additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time
of their examination. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the total allowance was $12.5&nbsp;million, which amounted
to 3.85% of total loans and 33.01% of nonperforming assets. Management considers whether the
allowance should be adjusted to protect against risks in the loan portfolio. Management will
continue to monitor and modify the level of the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain it
at a level which management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses. </I>The following table sets forth the allocation of
allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated. Management believes that the
allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the
allowance by category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use
of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. The
flow of deposits is influenced by a variety of factors including general economic conditions,
changes in market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. The Banks rely on competitive
pricing of its deposit products and customer service to attract and retain deposits, however market
interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect the
Banks&#146; ability to attract and retain deposits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks&#146; deposits totaled $347.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. Demand deposits totaled
$67.2&nbsp;million and comprised 19.4% of total deposits. Savings, NOW, and money market accounts
totaled $107.2&nbsp;million and comprised 30.9% of total deposits. Certificates of deposit were 49.7%
of the total deposits for a balance of $172.6&nbsp;million. Certificates of deposit include brokered
deposits totaling $79.7&nbsp;million, of which $67.0&nbsp;million or 84.0% are CDARS (Certificate of Deposit
Account Registry Service) deposits. CDARS is a deposit placement service that allows us to place
our customers&#146; funds in FDIC-insured certificates of deposits at other banks and to simultaneously
receive an equal sum of funds from the customers of other banks in the CDARS Network. The majority
of CDARS deposits are gathered within our geographic footprint through established customer
relationships. For further information regarding the Banks&#146; deposits see &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Deposits&#148; and Note 9 to the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit&nbsp;13 of Form 10-K.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the aggregate amount of outstanding certificates of deposit in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Borrowed Funds</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s short-term borrowings consist of securities sold under repurchase agreements and
FHLB advances totaling $24.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. Long-term debt consists of a FHLB
advance and various corporate term notes and lines of credit totaling $26.1&nbsp;million at an average
rate of 4.53% at December&nbsp;31, 2008. For further information regarding the Banks&#146; borrowed funds see
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Borrowed
Funds, and Contractual Commitments&#148; and Notes 12 and 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Exhibit&nbsp;13 to the Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks face strong competition among financial institutions in Washington, D.C., Northern
Virginia, Richmond and Hampton, Virginia and suburban Maryland for both deposits and loans.
Principal competitors include other community commercial banks and larger financial institutions
with branches in the Banks&#146; service area. Intense competition is expected to continue as bank
mergers and acquisitions of smaller banks by larger institutions in the Washington, D.C., Richmond
and Hampton, Virginia metropolitan regions may be expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates, personalized services, the
quality and range of financial services, convenience of office locations and office hours.
Competition for deposits comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings associations, credit
unions, money market funds and other investment alternatives. The primary factors in competing for
loans are interest rates, loan origination fees, the quality and range of lending services and
personalized services. Competition for loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings
associations, mortgage banking firms, credit unions and other financial intermediaries. The Banks
face competition for deposits and loans throughout their market areas not only from local
institutions but also from out-of-state financial intermediaries which have opened loan production
offices or which solicit deposits in its market areas. Many of the financial intermediaries
operating in the Banks&#146; market areas offer certain services, such as trust<B>, </B>investment and
international banking services, which the Banks do not offer. Additionally, banks with larger
capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger
lending limits and are thereby able to serve the needs of larger customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compete with other financial services providers, the Banks principally rely upon
local promotional activities, personal relationships established by officers, directors and
employees with its customers, and specialized services tailored to meet its customers&#146; needs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Employees</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company employed 102 people on a full time basis. The employees are
not represented by a union and management believes that its relations with its employees are good.
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>SUPERVISION AND REGULATION</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commercial banking business is not only affected by general economic conditions but is
also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of
regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board implements
national monetary policies by its open-market operations in U.S. Government securities, by
adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve
requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by
depository institutions. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board in these areas influence
the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans
and paid on deposits. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be
predicted.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law.
Set forth below is a summary description of certain provisions of certain laws which relate to the
regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>The Company</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, as a registered bank holding company, is subject to regulation under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;BHCA&#148;). Such regulations include prior approval of
Company affiliates and subsidiaries. The Company is required to file quarterly reports and annual
reports with the Federal Reserve Board and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board
may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Federal Reserve Board may conduct examinations of the
Company and its subsidiaries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board may require that the Company terminate an activity or terminate
control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries or affiliates when the Federal Reserve Board
believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk
to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries. The Federal
Reserve Board also has the authority to regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt,
including authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt. Under
certain circumstances, the Company must file written notice and obtain approval from the Federal
Reserve Board prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the BHCA and regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, a bank holding company
and its nonbanking subsidiaries are prohibited from requiring certain tie-in arrangements in
connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services.
Further, the Company is required by the Federal Reserve Board to maintain certain levels of
capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the
acquisition of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities, or
substantially all of the assets, of any bank or bank holding company. Prior approval of the Federal
Reserve Board is also required for the merger or consolidation of the Company and another bank
holding company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is prohibited by the BHCA, except in certain statutorily prescribed instances,
from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting
shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or
indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing
services to its subsidiaries. However, the Company, subject to the prior approval of the Federal
Reserve Board, may engage in any activities, or acquire shares of companies engaged in activities,
that are deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Additionally, bank holding companies that
elect to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in insurance, securities and, under
certain circumstances, merchant banking activities. The Company has not made the financial holding
company election with the Federal Reserve Board.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of
financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an
unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s policy that in serving as
a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use
available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of
financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising
capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding
company&#146;s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks
will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking
practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s regulations or both. This doctrine has
become known as the &#147;source of strength&#148; doctrine. The validity of
the source of strength doctrine has been and is likely to continue to be the subject of
litigation-until definitively resolved by the courts or by Congress.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANB, as a national banking association, is subject to primary supervision, examination and
regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#147;OCC&#148;). If, as a result of an
examination of ANB, the OCC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset
quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of the ANB&#146;s operations are
unsatisfactory or that ANB or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation,
various remedies are available to the OCC. Such remedies include the power to enjoin &#147;unsafe or
unsound practices,&#148; to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any
violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice, to issue an administrative order that can be
judicially enforced, to direct an increase in capital, to restrict the growth of ANB, to assess
civil monetary penalties, and to remove officers and directors. The FDIC has similar enforcement
authority, in addition to its authority to terminate a bank&#146;s deposit insurance, in the absence of
action by the OCC and upon a finding that a bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition, is engaging
in unsafe or unsound activities, or that its conduct poses a risk to the deposit insurance fund or
may prejudice the interest of its depositors. On October&nbsp;1, 2008, ANB entered into a written
agreement with the OCC. The written agreement was filed with the SEC as an exhibit to a current
report on Form 8-K dated October&nbsp;2, 2008. Under the terms of the written agreement, ANB has agreed
to take certain actions relating to its lending operations and capital compliance. For details,
see our disclosure below in section &#147;Written Agreement&#148; and in Note 4 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements filed in Exhibit&nbsp;13 to the Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CBT is a Virginia chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, and its
depositors are insured by the FDIC. The Federal Reserve and the Virginia State Corporation
Commission and its Bureau of Financial Institutions regulate and monitor CBT&#146;s operations. CBT is
required to file with the Federal Reserve quarterly financial reports on the financial condition
and performance of the organization. The Federal Reserve and State conduct periodic onsite and
offsite examinations of CBT. CBT must comply with a wide variety of reporting requirements and
banking regulations. The laws and regulations governing CBT generally have been promulgated to
protect depositors and the deposit insurance funds and not to protect various shareholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Insurance of Deposit Accounts</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, generally up to
a maximum of $100,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for
self-directed retirement accounts. However, pursuant to its statutory authority, the Board of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recently increased the deposit insurance available on deposit
accounts to $250,000 effective until December&nbsp;31, 2009. Our deposits are subject to Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance assessments. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation has adopted a risk-based system for determining deposit insurance assessments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;22, 2008, the FDIC published a final rule that raises the current deposit
insurance assessment rates uniformly for all institutions by 7 basis points (to a range from 12 to
50 basis points) effective for the first quarter of 2009. On February&nbsp;27, 2009, the FDIC also
issued a final rule that revises the way the FDIC calculates federal deposit insurance assessment
rates beginning in the second quarter of 2009. Under the new rule, the FDIC will first establish
an institution&#146;s initial base assessment rate. This initial base assessment rate will range,
depending on the risk category of the institution, from 12 to 45 basis points. The FDIC will then
adjust the initial base assessment (higher or lower) to obtain the total base assessment rate. The
adjustments to the initial base assessment rate will be based upon an institution&#146;s levels of
unsecured debt, secured liabilities, and brokered deposits. The total base assessment rate will
range from 7 to 77.5 basis points of the institution&#146;s deposits. Additionally, the FDIC issued an
interim rule that would impose a special 20 basis points assessment on June&nbsp;30, 2009, which would
be collected on September&nbsp;30, 2009. However, the FDIC has indicated a willingness to decrease the
special assessment to 10 basis points under certain circumstances concerning the overall financial
health of the insurance fund. Special assessments of 10 and 20 basis points would result in
additional expense to the Company of approximately $293,000 to $586,000, respectively. The interim
rule also allows for additional special assessments.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;14, 2008, the FDIC announced a new program &#151; the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
Program (&#147;TLGP&#148;). This program has two components. One guarantees newly issued senior unsecured
debt of the participating organizations, up to certain limits established for each institution,
issued between October&nbsp;14, 2008 and June&nbsp;30, 2009. The FDIC will pay the unpaid principal and
interest on an FDIC-guaranteed debt instrument upon the uncured failure of the participating entity
to make a timely payment of principal or interest in accordance with the terms of the instrument.
The guarantee will remain in effect until June&nbsp;30, 2012. On February&nbsp;27, 2009, the FDIC issued an
interim rule allowing participants to apply to have the FDIC guarantee newly issued senior
unsecured debt that mandatorily converts into common shares on a specified date that is on or
before June&nbsp;30, 2012. In return for the FDIC&#146;s guarantee, participating institutions will pay the
FDIC a fee based on the amount and maturity of the debt. The Company has opted not to participate
in this component of the TLGP. The other component of the program provides full FDIC insurance
coverage for non-interest bearing transaction deposit accounts, regardless of dollar amount, until
December&nbsp;31, 2009. An annualized 10 basis point assessment on balances in noninterest-bearing
transaction accounts that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000 will be assessed
on a quarterly basis to insured depository institutions participating in this component of the
TLGP. The Company has chosen to participate in this component of the TLGP. The additional expense
related to this coverage is not expected to be significant for either of the Banks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;10, 2009, Treasury announced its Capital Assistance Program (&#147;CAP&#148;) under which
Treasury will make capital available to financial institutions through Treasury&#146;s purchase of
cumulative mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The preferred shares will mandatorily convert
to common stock after seven years. Prior to that time, the preferred shares are convertible in
whole or in part at the option of the institution, subject to the approval of the institution&#146;s
primary federal regulator. Institutions that have received an investment from Treasury under the
CPP may use proceeds from the CAP to redeem preferred shares issued in the CPP, effectively
exchanging the preferred stock sold under the CPP for CAP convertible preferred stock
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (&#147;ARRA&#148;), more commonly known as the
economic stimulus or economic recovery package, was signed into law on February&nbsp;17, 2009, by
President Obama. ARRA includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and
provide for extensive infrastructure, energy, health, and education needs. In addition, ARRA
imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and
future TARP recipients until the recipient has repaid the Treasury, which is now permitted under
ARRA without penalty and without the need to raise new capital, subject to the Treasury&#146;s
consultation with the recipient&#146;s appropriate regulatory agency.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Financing
Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on
bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter
ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 1.12 basis points for each
$100 in domestic deposits maintained at an institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various other requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States affect the
operations of the Banks. Federal statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the Banks&#146;
operations, including reserves against deposits, interest rates payable on deposits, loans,
investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of branch offices, capital
requirements and disclosure obligations to depositors and borrowers. Further, the Banks are
required to maintain certain levels of capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Written Agreement</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;1, 2008, the Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, The Adams National Bank (the
&#147;Bank&#148;), entered into a written agreement with its primary regulator, The Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (the &#147;OCC&#148;). Under the terms of the written agreement, the Bank has agreed to take
certain actions relating to the Bank&#146;s lending operations and capital compliance. Specifically,
the OCC is requiring the Bank to take the following actions:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">a) conduct a review of senior management to ensure that these individuals can perform the
duties required under the Bank&#146;s policies and procedures and the requirements of the written
agreement, and
where necessary, the Bank must provide a written program to address the training of the
Bank&#146;s senior officers;

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">b) achieve certain regulatory capital levels, which are greater than the regulatory
requirements to be &#147;well capitalized&#148; under bank regulatory requirements by October&nbsp;31,
2008. In particular, the Bank must achieve a: 12% total risk-based capital to total
risk-weighted assets ratio; 11% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio; and 9% Tier 1
capital to adjusted total assets ratio;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">c) develop and implement a three-year capital program;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">d) make additions to the allowances for loan and lease losses and adopt and implement
written policies and procedures for establishing and maintaining the allowance in a manner

implement a program to eliminate regulatory criticism of these assets, engage in an ongoing
review of the Bank&#146;s criticized assets and develop and implement procedures for the
effective monitoring of the loan portfolio;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">g) hire an independent appraiser to provide a written or updated appraisal of certain
assets;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">h) develop and implement a program to improve the management of the loan portfolio and to
provide the Board with monthly written reports on credit quality;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">i) employ a consultant to perform a quarterly quality review of the Bank&#146;s assets;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">j) revise the Bank&#146;s lending policy in accordance with OCC requirements; and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">k) maintain acceptable liquidity levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written agreement includes time frames to implement the foregoing and on-going compliance
requirements for the Bank, including requirements to report to the OCC. The written agreement also
requires the Bank to establish a committee of the Board of Directors which will be responsible for
overseeing compliance with the written agreement.
</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Banks. The Company&#146;s ability to
pay cash dividends is limited by Delaware corporate law. In addition, the prior approval of the
Banks&#146; primary regulator is required if the total of all dividends declared by the individual Banks
in any calendar year exceeds that bank&#146;s net income for the year combined with its retained net
profits for the preceding two years, less any transfers to surplus, that is still available for
dividends.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks&#146; regulators have authority to prohibit the Banks from engaging in activities that,
in the regulators opinion, constitute unsafe or unsound practices in conducting its business. It
is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question and other factors, that
the regulator could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might, under some
circumstances, be such an unsafe or unsound practice. Further, the OCC and the Federal Reserve
Board have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital
by banks or bank holding companies under their jurisdiction. Compliance with the standards set
forth in such guidelines and the restrictions that are or may be imposed under the prompt
corrective action
provisions of federal law could limit the amount of dividends which the Banks or the Company
may pay. Pursuant to the terms of the Written Agreement, Adams National Bank may not make any
capital distributions to the Company without written approval from the OCC.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of
credit to, or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of, the Company or other
affiliates, the purchase of or investments in stock or other securities thereof, the taking of such
securities as collateral for loans and the purchase of assets of the Company or other affiliates.
Such restrictions prevent the Company and such other affiliates from borrowing from the Banks,
unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts. Further, such
secured loans and investments by the Banks to or in the Company or to or in any other affiliate is
limited to 10% of the individual Bank&#146;s capital and surplus (as defined by federal regulations) and
such secured loans and investments are limited, in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank&#146;s capital and
surplus (as defined by federal regulations). Additional restrictions on transactions with
affiliates may be imposed on the Banks under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal
law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Capital Standards</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC have adopted risk-based minimum capital rules intended
to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking
organization&#146;s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and
transactions, and those which are recorded as off balance sheet items. Under these rules, nominal
dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by
one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk,
such as certain U.S. Treasury securities, to 100% for assets with relatively high credit risk, such
as business loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A banking organization&#146;s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying
capital by its total risk adjusted assets. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets, which
include off balance sheet items, against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital
and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital consists primarily of
common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (cumulative perpetual
preferred stock for bank holding companies) and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less
most intangible assets. Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for
possible loan and lease losses, cumulative preferred stock, long-term preferred stock, eligible
term subordinated debt and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity. The
inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of
the federal banking agencies. The federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of qualifying
total capital to risk-adjusted assets of 8% and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted
assets of 4%. In addition to the risk-based guidelines, federal banking regulators require banking
organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to total assets, referred to as the
leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under federal regulations, an institution is generally considered &#147;well capitalized&#148; if it has
a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%,
and a Tier I capital (leverage)&nbsp;ratio of at least 5%. Federal law generally requires full-scope
on-site annual examinations of all insured depository institutions by the appropriate federal bank
regulatory agency, although the examination may occur at longer intervals for small
well-capitalized or state chartered banks. Pursuant to the terms of the Written Agreement, Adams
National Bank is required to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 12%, a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 11%, and a leverage ratio of at least 9% in order to be considered &#147;adequately
capitalized&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current risk-based capital ratio analysis establishes minimum supervisory guidelines and
standards. It does not evaluate all factors affecting an organization&#146;s financial condition.
Factors which are not evaluated include (i)&nbsp;overall interest rate exposure; (ii)&nbsp;quality and level
of earnings; (iii)&nbsp;investment or loan portfolio concentrations; (iv)&nbsp;quality of loans and
investments; (v)&nbsp;the effectiveness of loan and investment policies; (vi)&nbsp;certain risks arising from
nontraditional activities and (vii)&nbsp;management&#146;s overall ability to monitor and control other
financial and operating risks, including the risks presented by concentrations of credit and
nontraditional activities. The capital adequacy assessment of federal bank regulators will,
however, continue to include analyses of the foregoing considerations and in particular, the level
and severity of problem and classified assets. Market risk of a banking organization&#151;risk of loss
stemming from movements in market prices&#151;is not evaluated under the current risk-based capital
ratio analysis (and is therefore analyzed by the bank regulators through a general assessment of an
organization&#146;s capital adequacy) unless trading activities constitute 10% of $1&nbsp;billion or
more of the assets of such organization. Such an organization (unless exempted by the banking
regulators) and certain other banking organization designated by the banking regulators must
include in their risk-based capital ratio analysis charges for, and hold capital against, general
market risk of all positions held in their trading account and of foreign exchange and commodity
positions wherever located, as well as against specific risk of debt and equity positions located
in their trading account. Currently, the Company does not calculate a risk-based capital charge for
its market risk.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve
the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below
one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. The law requires each federal banking agency to
promulgate regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository
institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well capitalized, adequately
capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as &#147;well capitalized,&#148;
&#147;adequately capitalized&#148; or &#147;undercapitalized&#148; may be treated as though it were in the next lower
capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants
such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is
subject to more restrictions. The federal banking agencies, however, may not treat an institution
as &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; unless its capital ratio actually warrants such treatment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to restrictions and sanctions imposed under the prompt corrective action
provisions, commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the
federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations
of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written
agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or
receiver, the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced, the termination
of insurance of deposits (in the case of a depository institution), the imposition of civil money
penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of formal and informal
agreements, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties
and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial
determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.

requires banks to assess and help meet the credit needs of the community in which the bank
operates. The OCC examines the Bank to determine its level of compliance with CRA and the Federal
Reserve Board examines CBT to determine its level of compliance with CRA. The OCC and the Federal

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Riegel-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the
&#147;Interstate Act&#148;), a bank holding company that is adequately capitalized and managed may obtain
approval under the BHCA to acquire an existing bank located in another state generally without
regard to state law prohibitions on such acquisitions. A bank holding company, however, can not be
permitted to make such an acquisition if, upon consummation, it would control (a)&nbsp;more than 10% of
the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States or (b)&nbsp;30% or
more of the deposits in the state in which the bank is located. A state may limit the percentage of
total deposits that may be held in that state by any one bank or bank holding company if
application of such limitation does not discriminate against out of state banks. An out of
state bank holding company may not acquire a state bank in existence for less than a minimum length
of time that may be prescribed by state law except that a state may not impose more than a five
year existence requirement. Since June&nbsp;1, 1997 (and prior to that date in some instances), banks
have been able to expand across state lines where qualifying legislation adopted by certain states
prior to that date prohibits such interstate expansion. Banks may also expand across state lines
through the acquisition of an individual branch of a bank located in another state or through the
establishment of a <U>de novo</U> branch in another state where the law of the state in which the
branch is to be acquired or established specifically authorizes such acquisition or <U>de novo</U>

intended to address corporate and accounting fraud. In addition to the establishment of a new
accounting oversight board that will enforce auditing, quality control and independence standards
and will be funded by fees from all publicly traded companies, Sarbanes-Oxley places certain
restrictions on the scope of services that may be provided by accounting firms to their public
company audit clients. Any non-audit service being provided to a public company audit client will
require preapproval by the company&#146;s audit committee. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley makes certain
changes to the requirements for audit partner rotation after a period of time. Sarbanes-Oxley
requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalent, to certify to
the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;), subject
to civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willingly violate this certification
requirement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarbanes-Oxley also increases the oversight of, and codifies certain requirements relating to
audit committees of public companies and how they interact with the company&#146;s &#147;registered public
accounting firm.&#148; Audit Committee members must be independent and are absolutely barred from
accepting consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer. In addition, companies
must disclose whether at least one member of the committee is a &#147;financial expert&#148; (as such term is
defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) and if not, why not. Under Sarbanes-Oxley, a
company&#146;s registered public accounting firm is prohibited from performing statutorily mandated
audit services for a company if such company&#146;s chief executive officer, chief financial officer,
comptroller, chief accounting officer or any person serving in equivalent positions had been
employed by such firm and participated in the audit of such company during the one-year period
preceding the audit initiation date. Sarbanes-Oxley also prohibits any officer or director of a
company or any other person acting under their direction from taking any action to fraudulently
influence, coerce, manipulate or mislead any independent accountant engaged in the audit of the
company&#146;s financial statements for the purpose of rendering the financial statements materially
misleading.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have incurred additional expense in complying with the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the resulting regulations, such compliance has not had a material impact on
our results of operations or financial condition to date. However, the Company expects audit costs
will increase in the future as it complies with the SEC&#146;s requirement that auditors must provide an
attestation of management&#146;s report on internal control over financial reporting. On January&nbsp;31,
2008, the SEC proposed a one-year extension of the auditor attestation requirement for smaller
public companies. Under the extension, the Company would be required to have the auditor
attestation beginning with the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2009.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realized a net loss of $5.8&nbsp;million for 2008, compared to net income of $3.1&nbsp;million for
2007. The net loss was the direct result of an $11.8&nbsp;million charge to the provision for loan
losses. The loan loss reserve is the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at
an adequate level to absorb probable loan losses. The increase in the provision for loan losses is
primarily attributable to our condominium and condo tenant association construction and
multi-family residential real estate loan portfolios, which continue to experience deterioration in
estimated collateral values and repayment abilities, where repayment is dependent upon the sale of
condominium units. Other reasons for the increase in the provision for loan losses are attributable
to an overall increase in nonperforming assets and the continuing general weakening of the economic
conditions and decline in real estate values in the markets served by the Company.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial condition may be affected by a decline in the value of the real estate securing
our loans. Real estate values have recently been declining in our market, which may affect our
financial condition. If we continue to receive updated appraisals revealing significant additional
weakness in our collateral, it will likely result in further losses. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the
Company&#146;s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $163.2&nbsp;million, and commercial business
loans totaled $43.7&nbsp;million. These two categories of loans represent 63.7% of the Company&#146;s loan
portfolio. The Company has curtailed its emphasis on the origination of these types of loans.
These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to
four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the
successful operations and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger
loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family
residential mortgage loans. Also, many of the Company&#146;s borrowers have more than one commercial
real estate or commercial business loan outstanding with the Company. Consequently, an adverse
development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the Company to a
significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to
four-family residential mortgage loan.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in Washington, D.C.
and to a lesser extent the Richmond and Hampton, Virginia market areas. Unlike larger banks that
are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to
customers primarily in Washington, D.C. The local economic conditions in the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area have a significant impact on its loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay
these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A significant decline in general
economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond the
Company&#146;s control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the
financial results of its banking operations.

general economy, both nationally and locally, due to the recession that began in December&nbsp;2007.
Housing markets have deteriorated throughout 2008 and through the present day, as evidenced by
reduced levels of sale, increasing inventories of houses and condominiums on the market, declining
house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market. It is possible that
these conditions will not improve or will worsen or that such conditions will result in a decrease

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans,
and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining
loan balance. The Company may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material
adverse effect on its operating results. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about
the collectibility of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the
value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of its
loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company relies on its
loan quality reviews, its experience and its evaluation of economic conditions, among other
factors. If the Company&#146;s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, its allowance for
credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses in its loan portfolio, resulting in additions
to its allowance. Material additions to its allowance would materially decrease its net income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s emphasis on continued diversification of its loan portfolio through the
origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans is one of the more significant
factors it takes into account in evaluating its allowance for credit losses and provision for
credit losses. As the Company further increases the amount of such types of loans in its
portfolio, the Company may determine to make additional or increased provisions for credit losses,
which could adversely affect its earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, bank regulators periodically review the Company&#146;s loan portfolio and credit
underwriting procedures as well as its allowance for credit losses and may require the Company to
increase its provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in
its allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by
changes in interest rates. The Company&#146;s results of operations depend substantially on its net
interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest-earning
assets and the interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities. At December&nbsp;31, 2008,
the Company&#146;s interest rate risk profile indicated that net interest income would increase in a
rising interest rate environment, but would decrease in a declining interest rate environment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in interest rates also affect the value of the Company&#146;s interest-earning assets, and
in particular the Company&#146;s securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities fluctuates
inversely with changes in interest rates. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company&#146;s available for sale
securities totaled $62.8&nbsp;million. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also is subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates.
Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities.
Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related
securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, the
Company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash
received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and
securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more
difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.

Growth and Profitability.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In the Company&#146;s market
area, the Company competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms,
credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment
banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors (whether regional or
national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Company
does and may offer certain services that the Company does not or cannot provide. The Company&#146;s
profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market area.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve
Board. ANB is subject to regulation by the OCC and by the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. CBT is
subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, the Bureau of Financial Institutions and by the
FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a
bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the
deposit insurance funds and depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in
connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of
restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank and the evaluation
of the adequacy of a bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and
oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a
material impact on the Company and its operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s operations are also subject to extensive regulation by other federal, state and
local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative
decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of its operations. The Company
believes that it is in substantial compliance in all material respects with applicable federal,
state and local laws, rules and regulations. Because its business is highly regulated, the laws,
rules and regulations applicable to the Company are subject to regular modification and change.
There are currently proposed various laws, rules and regulations that, if adopted, would impact its
operations, including, among other things, matters pertaining to corporate governance, requirements
for listing and maintenance on national securities exchanges and over the counter markets, and
Securities and Exchange Commission rules pertaining to public reporting disclosures. There can be
no assurance that these proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or
regulations, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or
expensive or otherwise adversely affect the Company&#146;s business, financial condition or prospects.

assets; tier 1 capital at least equal to 11% of risk-weighted assets; and tier 1 capital at least
equal to 9% of adjusted total assets. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, ANB was considered to be &#147;adequately

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA)&nbsp;requires each federal banking agency to take prompt
corrective action with respect to banks that do no meet the minimum capital requirements. Once a
bank becomes undercapitalized, it is subject to various requirements and restrictions, including a
prohibition of the payment of capital distributions and management fees, restrictions on growth of
the bank&#146;s assets, and a requirement for prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals.
In addition, an undercapitalized bank must file a capital restoration plan with its principal
federal regulator.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an undercapitalized bank fails in any material aspect to implement a plan approved by its
regulator, the agency may impose additional restrictions on the bank. These include, among others,
requiring the recapitalization or sale of the bank, restrictions with affiliates, and limiting the
interest rates the bank my pay on deposits. Further, even after the bank has attained adequately
capitalized status, the appropriate federal agency may, if it determines, after notice and hearing,
that the bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has not corrected a deficiency from its most
recent examination, treat the bank as if it were undercapitalized and subject the bank to the
regulatory restrictions of such lower classification.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions with respect to
undercapitalized institutions, insured banks and their holding companies may be subject to
potential enforcement actions by their regulators for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting
their business or the violations of law or regulation, including the filing of false or misleading
regulatory reports. Enforcement actions under this authority may include the issuance of cease and
desist orders, the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase
capital, formal and informal agreements, or the removal and prohibition orders against
&#147;institution-affiliates parties&#148;. Further, the Federal Reserve may bring an enforcement action
against the bank holding company either to address the undercapitalization in the holding company
or to require the holding company to implement measures to remediate undercapitalization in a
subsidiary. It is possible that if ANB realizes losses over the next few quarters, ANB may fall
into the &#147;undercapitalized&#148; regulatory classification, which would have a material and adverse
effect on the bank and the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>The Company&#146;s Expenses Will Increase As A Result Of Increases in FDIC Insurance Premiums.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;22, 2008, the FDIC published a final rule raising the current deposit insurance
assessment rates uniformly for all institutions by seven basis points (to a range from 12 to 50
basis points) for the first quarter of 2009. On February&nbsp;27, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule
changing the way that the FDIC calculates federal deposit insurance assessment rates beginning in
the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, the FDIC issued an interim rule that would impose a
special 20 basis points assessment on June&nbsp;30, 2009, which would be collected on September&nbsp;30,
2009. For more information on FDIC assessments, see &#147;Regulation and Supervision&#151;FDIC Insurance on
Deposits&#148;.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>ANB is no longer considered &#147;well capitalized&#148; for regulatory capital purposes, which will
cause the Bank to incur increased premiums for deposit insurance and require FDIC approval to
gather brokered deposits including CDARS reciprocal deposits</I></B><I>.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the date of the Written Agreement with the OCC, October&nbsp;1, 2008, ANB is not considered
&#147;well capitalized&#148; for regulatory purposes. As a result, the FDIC will assess higher deposit
insurance premiums on ANB, which will negatively impact earnings. In addition, we will be required
to obtain FDIC approval to gather or renew brokered deposits including CDARS reciprocal deposits,
during such time as we remain &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; for regulatory purposes. Requiring us to
obtain regulatory approval prior to accepting or renewing brokered deposits will affect our
ability to improve our liquidity position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>ANB&#146;s capital ratios will likely restrict our ability to grow our balance sheet as we have in
the past, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and
liquidity.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net loss in 2008 has reduced our stockholders&#146; equity. If we experience additional losses
in the future, it will likely restrict our ability to grow the balance sheet as we have in the
past. Accordingly, ANB&#146;s short term strategy is to manage our credit quality and strengthen, rather
than grow, our balance sheet. If our credit quality continues to deteriorate, additional decreases
to stockholders&#146; equity may occur. Any future growth may subject ANB to risk that such growth, absent
an increase in ANB regulatory capital, would cause ANB to
remain below the minimum requirements to be considered &#147;adequately capitalized&#148;. If we are not able
to grow our assets, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely
affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Our business is subject to liquidity risk, and changes in our source of funds may adversely
affect our performance and financial condition by increasing out cost of funds.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to make loans is directly related to our ability to secure funding. Core deposits
are our primary source of liquidity. We rely on advances from the FHLB of Atlanta as a funding
source. Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, ANB did not have access to purchase federal funds
under agreements from other correspondent banks and it is possible that ANB will continue to not
have access to purchase federal funds while under the Written Agreement with the OCC.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Personnel Committee</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Committee reviews the performance of named executive officers, as well as other
officers and employees, and determines the compensation programs of these individuals. Directors
Cook and Shell comprise the Personnel Committee. Mr.&nbsp;Cook and Mr.&nbsp;Shell are independent and neither
has ever been an officer or employee of us or any of our subsidiaries. The Personnel Committee met
two times during 2008 to determine compensation and to review compensation programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has appointed a Personnel Committee which administers the compensation
program. The Committee strives to offer a fair and competitive policy to govern named executive
officers&#146; base salaries and an incentive plan and to attract and retain competent, dedicated, and
ambitious managers whose efforts will enhance our products and services and our subsidiary banks,
resulting in higher profitability, increased dividends to our stockholders and appreciation in our
common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of the compensation are base salary and a bonus plan. As each element of
compensation is intended to accomplish a specific goal, payments under one element are not taken
into account when determining the amount paid under a different element.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation of the named executive officers is reviewed and approved annually by the
Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Personnel Committee. The Personnel Committee
considers the views and recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer in making the compensation
decisions affecting the executive officers who report to him. The Chief Executive Officer&#146;s role in
recommending compensation programs is to develop and recommend appropriate performance measures and
targets for individual compensation levels and compile competitive benchmark data to assess the
competitive labor market. The Chief Executive Officer does not participate in the decisions
regarding changes in his compensation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Summary Compensation Table</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not provide any monetary compensation directly to our executive officers. Instead, the
executive officers are paid by the lead bank, The Adams National Bank, for services rendered in
their capacity as executive officers of Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. and the Adams National
Bank. The following table shows the compensation of Jeanne D. Hubbard, our principal executive
officer until September&nbsp;4, 2008, Robert Walker, our principal executive officer from September&nbsp;4,
2008 through year end, and our two highest compensated executive officers who received total
compensation of $100,000 for services to us or any of our subsidiaries during the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banks offers a KSOP, an employee stock ownership plan with 401(k) provisions to all
eligible employees. Participants may make pre-tax and after-tax contributions to the 401(k) up to
the maximum allowable under Federal regulations. We match the pre-tax employee participant&#146;s
contributions at a rate of 100% of the first 3% of the employee&#146;s qualifying salary and 50% up to
the next 2% of salary. The employee stock ownership plan is a non-leveraged employee stock
ownership plan and is a profit sharing plan based upon the earning performance of Abigail Adams
National Bancorp, Inc. In addition, the Board of Directors may elect to pay a discretionary
contribution on an annual basis. The employee stock ownership plan awards vest at the end of the
third year. There were no awards in 2008, 2007 or 2006. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the employee stock
ownership plan held 53,760 shares of our common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health insurance, group life insurance, and group disability insurance are available to all
eligible employees and executive officers. All employees may elect to participate in voluntary
dental and vision plans. Such plans are standard in the banking industry. These plans are not tied
to our performance or individual performance. The cost of providing such plans to all eligible
employees and executive officers is not taken into account when determining specific salaries of
the named executive officers and is seen as a cost of doing business.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We assumed the obligations of Consolidated Bank &#038; Trust Company&#146;s noncontributory defined
pension plan, as a result of the acquisition of Consolidated Bank &#038; Trust Company on July&nbsp;29, 2005.
Pension benefits vest after five years of service, and were based on years of service and average
final salary. During 1997, Consolidated Bank &#038; Trust Company froze the accrual of future service
benefits; however, benefits continued to accrue for future compensation adjustments. In 2003, the
compensation levels were frozen for benefit calculation purposes. The defined benefit plan
maintained a September&nbsp;30&nbsp;year end for computing benefit obligations. The Consolidated Bank &#038; Trust
Company Pension Plan terminated effective March&nbsp;31, 2007 and was fully distributed in 2008. We have
no other pension plans. The named executive officers do not participate in this plan.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have two stock option plans for directors and key employees. A Nonqualified Stock Option
Plan was originally adopted in 1987, and amended in 1989, pursuant to which non-statutory stock
options for up to 170,156 shares, as adjusted, of our common stock can be awarded to our officers.
Since its inception in 1987, no awards have been made under this Nonqualified Stock Option Plan.
The 2000 Stock Option Plan, originally adopted in February&nbsp;2000, is a nonqualified stock option
plan that was awarded to directors and key officers, and has 8,062 shares under option outstanding.
The options in the 2000 Plan were awarded at 90% of the fair market value of our common stock at
the date of the grant and vested over three years. No options may be exercised beyond ten years
from the date of the grant. There were no plan-based awards in 2008.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has reviewed each director&#146;s relationships, both direct and indirect,
with Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries, the Adams National Bank and
Consolidated Bank &#038; Trust Company, and the compensation and other payments, if any, each director
has received from or made to Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries in order to
determine whether such director qualifies as independent under Rule&nbsp;4200(a)(15) of the Marketplace
Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. The Board of Directors has determined that the Board of
Directors has at least a majority of independent directors, and that each of the following
directors has no financial or personal ties, either directly or indirectly, with Abigail Adams
National Bancorp, Inc. or its subsidiaries other than compensation as a director of Abigail Adams
National Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries, banking relationships in the ordinary course of
business with the subsidiary banks and ownership of Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. common
shares and thus qualifies as independent under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules: A. George Cook, David
Bradley, Todd Shell, Sandra Ramsey and Douglas V. Reynolds. There were no transactions required to
be reported under &#147;Transactions with Certain Related Persons&#148; that were considered in determining
the independence of our directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These five directors are referred to individually as an &#147;Independent Director&#148; and
collectively as the &#147;Independent Directors.&#148; The Independent Directors constitute a majority of the
Board of Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has also determined that each member of the Audit Committee of the
Board meets the independence requirements applicable to that committee prescribed by the NASDAQ
Marketplace Rules, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adams National Bank and Consolidated Bank &#038; Trust Company intend that all transactions
between the banks and their executive officers, directors, holders of 10% or more of the shares of
any class of our common stock and affiliates thereof, will contain terms no less favorable to the
banks than could have been obtained by them in arm&#146;s-length negotiations with unaffiliated persons
and will be approved by a majority of independent outside directors of the banks not having any
interest in the transaction. Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary banks have
had and expect to have in the future, banking transactions in the ordinary course of business with
certain directors of Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary banks and their
associates, as well as with corporations or organizations with which they are connected as
directors, officers, stockholders, owners or partners. These banking transactions are made in the
ordinary course of business, are made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at
Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary banks for comparable transactions with
other persons, and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or present other
unfavorable features. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Banks had no loans outstanding
to directors and one to an executive officer totaling $69,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related party transactions must be approved by the Board of Directors prior to any commitment
by Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary banks to any such transactions.
Directors do not participate in the discussions and are not present for voting on their own related
party transaction. All of the material terms, conditions, and purpose of the transaction shall be
in writing and provided to the Board of Directors, together with the written request for approval
of any such transaction. The transaction shall be approved by the appropriate senior officer before
being submitted to the Board for approval. Related party transactions for ongoing or continuing
services can be reviewed and pre-approved within reasonable parameters by the Board of Directors on
an as-needed basis. If the terms, pricing, or conditions change so as to go outside the parameters
cited in the request, the transaction shall be resubmitted for review and approval after the fact.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Section&nbsp;402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits an issuer from: (1)&nbsp;extending or
maintaining credit; (2)&nbsp;arranging for the extension of credit; or (3)&nbsp;renewing an extension of
credit in the form of a personal loan for an officer or director. There are several exceptions to
this general prohibition, one of which is applicable to us. Sarbanes-Oxley does not apply to loans
made by a depository institution that is insured by the FDIC and is subject to the insider lending
restrictions of the Federal Reserve Act. All loans to the banks&#146; directors and officers are made
in conformity with Federal Reserve Act regulations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee&#146;s policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by
the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services,
audit-related services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for up
to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to particular service or category of services and
is generally subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval
authority to its Chair when expedition of services is necessary. The independent registered public
accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee
regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in
accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date. For the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, 100% of &#147;Audit Fees&#148; were approved under the pre-approval policy.
All other services were approved by the Audit Committee prior to engagement.
