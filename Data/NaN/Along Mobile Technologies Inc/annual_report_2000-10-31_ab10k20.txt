ITEM 1:	BUSINESS (General)

A.	The Company

Allied Artists Entertainment Group, Inc., formerly Merit Diversified
International, Inc. ("the Company") owns and operates through its
subsidiary, Allied Entertainment Group.  Allied distributes music ranging
from Platinum recording rap artist, Coolio to Mexican-American Rock bank,
Renegade. Allied Artists maintains a web site at www.alliedartists.net
<http://www.alliedartists.net>

B.	History of Operations

The Company, before acquiring Allied was incorporated in the State of
Utah, in 1983, subsequently reincorporated in the State of Nevada.
Initially, the Company published a telephone directory, but this operation
was suspended in 1987 due to lack of operating funds and revenues.  From
1988 until new management was appointed in 1998, the Company made several
attempts to acquire and operate various businesses. As mentioned above,
during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2000, the company acquired all
outstanding shares of Allied Entertainment Group, Inc. As of September 15,
2000 the company changed its name from Merit Diversified International
to Allied Artists Entertainment Group, Inc.

Over the years, Allied Artists has produced and distributed hundreds of
films. Though it originally dealt with early talkies, soundtracks, and
cartoons, the corporation is now involved in motion picture production
and television for various studios, remaining active in musical and
television productions, as well as music videos. The history of Allied
Artists is long and varied. It became a household name during the dawn
of motion pictures when Allied Artists Records was originally the
soundtrack division of Allied Artists. Born shortly after the demise of
silent pictures, Allied became one of the first companies in
Hollywood to produce motion picture soundtracks for commercial release,
releasing hundreds of soundtracks throughout the years, with numerous
recording artists in worldwide-release. Allied Artists employees 325
individuals and independent contractors with distribution, administration
and promotional facilities operating from dozens of offices around the
world.

In 1981, Allied Artists Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of
Allied Entertainment Group, Inc., and broadened its focus to include
a variety of music productions. While branching out, a special emphasis
was placed on new talent completely outside the realm of motion picture
production.

In its evolution, Allied Artists has always underscored the value, talent,
and creativity of the individual performing artist and/or musical group.
This year, the Board of Directors, guided by its subsidiary's Chairman,
has vowed to move Allied Artists into the millennium by taking full
advantage of technology and all its advances. In keeping with its tradition
of conducting business from the perspective of the performing artist, the
corporation's officers have vowed to expand its open door policy
through technology.



ITEM 2:	PROPERTIES

cost of $2,000,000.  The Company issued 500,000 shares, paid $150,000
USD and issued a promise to pay an additional $350,000 for this business.
The company acquired equipment and intellectual properties  in this
exchange. Over the years, Allied Artists has produced and distributed
hundreds of films. Though it originally dealt with early talkies,
soundtracks, and cartoons, the corporation is now involved in motion
picture production and television for various studios, remaining active

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.	General Company Information and Summary of
      		Significant Accounting Policies

Allied Artists Entertainment Group, Inc., formerly Merit Diversified
International, Inc. ("the Company") owns and operates through its
subsidiary, Allied Entertainment Group.  Allied distributes music
ranging from Platinum recording rap artist, Coolio to Mexican-American
Rock bank, Renegade. Allied Artists maintains a web site at
www.alliedartists.net <http://www.alliedartists.net>

The Company, before acquiring Allied was incorporated in the State
of Utah, in 1983, subsequently reincorporated in the State of Nevada.
Initially, the Company published a telephone directory, but this
operation was suspended in 1987 due to lack of operating funds and
revenues.  From 1988 until new management was appointed in 1998, the
Company made several attempts to acquire and operate various businesses.
As mentioned above, during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2000,
the company acquired all outstanding shares of Allied Entertainment
Group, Inc. As of September 15, 2000 the company changed its name
from Merit Diversified International to Allied Artists Entertainment
Group, Inc.

Over the years, Allied Artists has produced and distributed hundreds
of films. Though it originally dealt with early talkies, soundtracks,
and cartoons, the corporation is now involved in motion picture
production and television for various studios, remaining active in
musical and television productions, as well as music videos. The
history of Allied Artists is long and varied. It became a household
name during the dawn of motion pictures when Allied Artists Records
was originally the soundtrack division of Allied Artists. Born
shortly after the demise of silent pictures, Allied became one of
the first companies in Hollywood to produce motion picture soundtracks
for commercial release, releasing hundreds of soundtracks throughout
the years, with numerous recording artists in worldwide-release.
Allied Artists employees 325 individuals and independent contractors
with distribution, administration and promotional facilities
operating from dozens of offices around the world.

In 1981, Allied Artists Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of
Allied Entertainment Group, Inc., and broadened its focus to include
a variety of music productions. While branching out, a special
emphasis was placed on new talent completely outside the realm

a straight line bases.

ALLIED ARTIST ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, INC.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Net Loss Per Share

Loss per share is computed based on the average number of shares
outstanding during each year.


Revenue Recognition

The Company generates revenues through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Allied Entertainment Group, Inc.


Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is the total of the current taxes
payable and the net of the change in the deferred income taxes.
Provision is made for deferred income taxes where differences exist
between the period in which transactions affect current taxable
income and the period in which they enter into the determination
of net income in the financial statements. The Company has a net
operating loss carry forward of approximately $2,000,000 available
to offset future taxable income.  The last of the carry forward
expires in 2009. No benefit has been recorded on the face of the
balance sheet for this benefit.


Note 2- Mergers and Acquisitions

The Company acquired 100% ownership of Allied Artists valued at
historic cost of $2,000,000.  The Company issued 500,000 shares,
paid $150,000 USD and issued a promise to pay an additional
$350,000 for this business. This transaction is being accounted
for as a purchase, with the results of operations of the acquired
entity included in the consolidated statement of income. Over
the years, Allied Artists has produced and distributed hundreds
of films. Though it originally dealt with early talkies, soundtracks,
and cartoons, the corporation is now involved in motion picture
production and television for various studios, remaining active
in musical and television productions, as well as music videos.

The Company reported in its most recent 8-K that it acquired for
600,000 shares, $250,000 cash,  and a commitment to build out a
new production facility at the cost of $5,000,000 a 100% ownership
of Eye Candy Post, valued at $6,800,000. However, that acquisition
has since been cancelled.  Though financial results reported in the third
quarter (quarter ended 5/31/00)consolidated financial
statements reflected this acquisition, year end consolidated
financial statements have been appropriately adjusted to exclude
this acquisition.

Note 3.	Related Party Transactions


There are no outstanding obligations due to or from related parties
as of August 31, 2000 and 1999.


Note 4.	Commitments and Contingencies

The Company has no commitments or contingencies as of August 31, 2000,
1999 Or 1998

Note 5 - Contributed Assets

Controlling interest in MERIT DIVERSIFIED INTERNATIONAL, INC.,
a Nevada Corporation, and its predecessor (the "Company"), was
transferred from  Jen Investment Corporation to the following
entities:

1. Selective Entertainment                   3,250,000 shares
2. United Assurance Company, Ltd. 	          3,250,000 shares
3. Apple Juice Productions		                 3,250,000 shares
4. International Synergy Corporation         3,250,000 shares
5. International Annuity Trust Corporation   3,250,000 shares
6. IAT Mortgage Bankers		                    3,250,000 shares

As a result of the transfer of controlling interest, the above
listed companies  have irrevocably  transferred into the Company
assets having a value $5,000,000 as follows:

1.	Master Tapes: Value of $1,203,814 appraised by George L.
     (Sonny) Carter, Tape Librarian, MCA Records, Inc.

2.	Films:  Two motion pictures ready for production; value of
      $880,000 appraised by Dr. Philip Chamberlin of the Academy
      of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.

3.	30,000 Dino Babies animation cels valued at $3,000,000 as
      appraised by Edward N. Okil, National Institute of Appraisers.
      In the most recent 8-K, there was a typographical error listing
      300,000 Dino Babies which should have been 30,000 Dino Babies.


Note 5.  Going Concern

The Company has incurred significant losses since its inception.
During the year ended August 31, 2000, the company acquired Allied
Entertainment Group, Inc., which was founded under the name Allied
Artists in the 1910s. A significant portion of the operating
results reported relate to the operating  performance history of
Allied Artists. The acquired entity is being accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting for a business combination.


Through shareholder contributions and the issuance of Company
shares (see note 2), the assets of Allied Artist were acquired
and presented on the consolidated balance sheet using the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations.

Due to the nature of the music and entertainment businesses,
the Company's prospects for the future are dependent on a
number of variables which cannot be predicted. There is fierce
competition in these industries, and the availability of future
financing is unknown.
