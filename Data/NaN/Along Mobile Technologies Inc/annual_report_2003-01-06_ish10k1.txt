Note 1. General Company Information and Summary of  Significant
        Accounting Policies

International Synergy Holding Company, Ltd., ., formerly Merit
Diversified International, Inc. ("the Company") was incorporated
in the State of Utah, in 1983, subsequently reincorporated in the
State of Nevada.  Initially, the Company published a telephone
directory, but this operation was suspended in 1987 due to lack
of operating funds and revenues.  From 1988 until new management
was appointed in 1998, the Company made several attempts to
acquire and operate various businesses.

The company changed its name in 2000 to International Synergy
Holding Company, Ltd. Its current focus has been in the
entertainment industry.  The Company is anticipating broadening
its holdings through strategic acquisitions, and will move with
careful determination.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles.

Property and Equipment

As of August 31, 2000 the Company acquired fixed assets.
Previously the Company depreciated its fixed assets over
their estimated useful lives on a straight line bases.

Reverse Stock Split

In August, 2001 there was a 8 to 1 reverse split of common stock.
All share and per share amounts have been restated accordingly.

Net Loss Per Share

Income/Loss per share is computed based on the average number
of shares outstanding during each year. Shares outstanding for
the year ended August 31, 2001 have been adjusted for an 8-1
reverse stock split.


Revenue Recognition

The Company employs the accrual method of accounting, and
therefore recognizes revenues when earned.

Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is the total of the current
taxes payable and the net of the change in the deferred income
taxes.  During the current year there was no operating activity.
As a result there is no current provision for income taxes.
Provision is made for deferred income taxes where differences
exist between the period in which transactions affect current
taxable income and the period in which they enter into the
determination of net income in the financial statements. The
Company has a net operating loss carry forward of approximately
$2,000,000 available to offset future taxable income.  The
last of the carry forward expires in 2009. No benefit has
been recorded on the face of the balance sheet for this benefit.

Note 2 - Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Net income (loss) per share and common equivalent share is
computed using The weighted average number of shares outstanding
during each period.

Note 3.	Related Party Transactions

There are no outstanding obligations due to or from related
parties as of August 31, 2002 and 2001.

Note 4.	Commitments and Contingencies

The Company has no commitments or contingencies as of August 31,
2002, or 2001

Note 5 - Contributed Assets

Controlling interest in INTERNATIONAL SYNERGY HOLDING, INC.,
a Nevada Corporation, and its predecessor Merit Diversified
Holding Company (the "Company"), was transferred from  Jen
Investment Corporation to the following entities:

1. Selective Entertainment                   	  406,250 shares
2. United Assurance Company, Ltd. 	          	  406,250 shares
3. Apple Juice Productions		              406,250 shares
4. International Synergy Corporation         	  406,250 shares
5. International Annuity Trust Corporation   	  406,250 shares
6. IAT Mortgage Bankers		                    406,250 shares
   (The above has been adjusted for 8:1 reverse stock split as of
    August 31, 2001)

As a result of the transfer of controlling interest, the above
listed companies  have irrevocably  transferred into the Company
assets having a value $5,000,000 as follows:

1.	Master Tapes: Value of $1,203,814 appraised by George L.
      (Sonny) Carter, Tape Librarian, MCA Records, Inc.

2.	Films:  Two motion pictures ready for production; value of
      $880,000 appraised  by Dr. Philip Chamberlin of the Academy
      of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.

3.	30,000 Dino Babies animation cels valued at $3,000,000 as
      appraised by Edward N. Okil, National Institute of
      Appraisers.

Note 6.  Going Concern
The Company has incurred significant losses since its inception.
Due to the nature of the music and entertainment businesses,
the Company's prospects for the future are  dependent on a
number of variables which cannot be predicted. There is fierce
competition in these industries, and the availability of future
financing is unknown.

Note 7. Mergers and Acquisitions
The Company acquired 100% ownership of Allied Entertainment Group
valued at historic cost of $2,000,000.  The Company issued 500,000
shares for this business. The Company has written off this
$2,000,000 figure, since Allied may not have the value originally
represented to the Company.  In the Company's 10-K for 2000, this
transaction was accounted for as a purchase, with the results
of operations of the acquired entity included in the consolidated
statement of income. The presentation of the year 2000 comparatives,
excludes the effect of this transaction.

Note 8. Quasi-reorganization
As a result of the demerging of Allied Artists Entertainment Group,
it was felt that a readjustment of the company's accounts in the
form of a quasi-reorganization was appropriate

A quasi-reorganization is an accounting procedure which results in
eliminating the accumulated defecit in retained earnings. This
accounting procedure is limited to a reclassification of accumulated
defecit as a reduction of paid-in capital.  The Company believes the
quasi-reorganization is appropriate because of the installation of
new executive officers, the above mentioned demerging of Allied
Artists Entertainment Group, and the formulation of a revised
operating plan. As a result thereof, it would be able to devote its
resources to its continuing operations. Because asset have been
stated at approximate fair values, the quasi-reorganization had no
effect on recorded assets.

Note 9. Subsequent Events

On September 28, 2001 (subsequent to the balance sheet date), 175,000
shares of common stock and 100,000 warrants were registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on For S-8.  The shares and
warrants issued were for compensation to certain independent consultants.
