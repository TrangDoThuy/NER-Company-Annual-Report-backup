ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

        ACI Telecentrics, Inc. (ACI) was incorporated under the name Automated
Communications, Incorporated under Minnesota law on January 13, 1987, and
changed its name to ACI Telecentrics, Inc. on July 26, 1996. ACI provides
inbound and outbound outsourced telephone-based sales and marketing services,
broadly defined as teleservices. In 2000, we established a wholly owned
subsidiary, Corporation ACI Telecentrics du Quebec, Inc., to manage and operate
all of our Canadian contact centers. As of December 31, 2002, we operated 801
workstations in 8 call centers located in Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska,
Indiana, California, and Quebec, Canada.

        We provide telemarketing services primarily in the telecommunications,
financial services and publishing industries. In the telecommunications
industry, we market long distance and a variety of network services to the
customers of Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) and support customer
service functions for Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLECs). In the
financial services industry, we conduct telemarketing projects for banks and
financial services companies in the areas of insurance; credit card customer
acquisition, retention, and renewal; credit card enhancement services; account
generation and retention; and customer service and inbound sales support. In the
publishing industry, our telemarketing programs assist magazine publishers in
acquiring new subscribers and soliciting subscription renewals. For the year
ended December 31, 2002, our revenue and loss from operations were $30,320,788
and $2,370,437, respectively. This represents a decrease in revenue of 8%
compared to 2001. The loss from operations in 2002 compares to an income from
operations of $389,448 in 2001.

Our web address is www.acitel.com. Investors may request a copy of our reports
by requesting a copy through our website.

INDUSTRY AND MARKET

        We believe that the telemarketing sector of marketing expenditures will
continue to grow and that the trend toward outsourcing telemarketing programs
will continue. Many companies choose to use telemarketing for customer
retention, customer service, and customer care programs, in addition to the
traditional sales programs. The telecommunications and financial services
industries, which ACI already serves, are undergoing deregulation or
consolidation, which may provide us with additional growth opportunities as
these businesses search for low-cost solutions for their marketing, sales, and
customer support needs. In 2002, businesses within the financial services,
telecommunications, and publishing industries accounted for most of our
revenues. The industries targeted by us, and the principal services provided,
are described below.

FINANCIAL SERVICES. ACI entered the financial services segment of the market in
1988. We provide telemarketing services for the credit card and noncredit card
financial segments, as well as fee-based segments such as membership clubs.
Types of telemarketing services performed for these clients include customer
acquisition, activation and retention, selling of discounted travel and shopping
clubs, debit card acquisition or upgrade, home equity loan lead generation,
mortgage lead generation, and pre-approved lines of credit. We support this
industry with both inbound and outbound services. Inbound programs include
enrollments in mortgage acceleration programs and sales of fee based products.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS. ACI entered the telecommunications segment of the market in
1987. We currently

                                       1
<PAGE>

provide telemarketing services for network services, long distance, Caller ID,
and enhanced consumer premise equipment (CPE products). In addition, we support
customer service, repair and billing inquiry functions for CLECs.

PUBLISHING. ACI provides telemarketing services to publishers, including
subscription renewals, subscription sales, and customer services. Our program
managers work closely with publishing clients to develop individually tailored
programs to enhance their marketing and sales efforts.

SALES AND MARKETING

        We strive to enhance the sales and service experiences of our client's
customers. Our marketing strategy emphasizes customized marketing solutions
tailored to meet the individual client's needs. We attract clients through
direct prospecting by our sales force, encouraging referrals from existing
clients who are satisfied with our quality service and gaining business through
other divisions of companies who are current clients.

PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS

        We rely on several clients for a significant portion of our revenues. In
2002, three clients accounted for 41% of our total revenue. Two of the three
clients (17% and 14% of total revenue, respectively) are two of the nation's
largest telephone operating companies. The third client (10% of total revenue)
is a marketer of credit card and mortgage loan services. In 2001, five clients
accounted for 66% of total revenue. Two of the five clients (12% and 11% of
total revenue, respectively) are two of the nations top credit card issuers; one
client (16% of total revenue) is one of the nation's largest providers of
consumer membership programs; one client (11% of total revenue) is one of the
nation's largest diversified financial services companies. The fifth client (16%
of total revenue) is one of the nation's largest telephone operating companies.

COMPETITION

        The telemarketing industry is highly competitive, but also continues to
be highly fragmented. We compete with both in-house telemarketing organizations
as well as other independent outsource telemarketing operations. In-house
telemarketing organizations provide a variety of services to their organizations
and comprise the majority of the telemarketing industry. Independent
telemarketing organizations range from numerous small, single-facility
operations to large, multifacility operations, such as SITEL Corporation, APAC
Teleservices Inc., Sykes Enterprises, RMH Teleservices, Inc. and West
Telemarketing Corporation. We also compete with other forms of marketing, such
as direct mail, television, and radio. We believe that the primary competitive
factors in the telephone-based marketing industry are reputation for quality
service, marketing results, technological expertise, price, the ability to
support inbound sales efforts, and the ability to design customized marketing
programs that address the needs of our clients. We believe that most of our
competitors are, like us, highly dependent on a small number of clients for a
large percentage of their business.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

        Telemarketing practices are regulated in the United States and Canada as
discussed below.

                                       2
<PAGE>

        UNITED STATES

        The telemarketing industry is subject to a significant amount of federal
and state regulation. The federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the
TCPA) prohibits telemarketers from using automated telephone dialing equipment
to call certain types of telephone numbers, such as hospital emergency room
telephone numbers. In addition, the TCPA prohibits the initiation of telephone
calls to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice
to deliver a message without the prior consent of the called party. The federal
Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 1994 (the TCFAPA)
broadly authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) to issue regulations
prohibiting misrepresentation in telemarketing sales. In August 1995, the FTC
issued regulations under the TCFAPA which, among other things, prohibits
initiating an outbound telephone call to a person that has stated that he or she
does not wish to receive an outbound call on behalf of the seller whose goods or
services are being offered, prohibit calls at any time other than between 8:00
A.M. and 9:00 P.M. local time, require a telemarketer to make certain
disclosures to the person receiving the call, and prohibit misrepresentations
regarding the cost, terms, restrictions, or performance of products or services
offered by phone.

        The FTC also administers the Fraud Prevention Act under which the FTC
has issued the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) prohibiting a variety of
deceptive, unfair or abusive practices in direct telephone sales. These rules
prohibit misrepresentations of the cost, quality, terms, restrictions,
performance or characteristics of products or services offered by telephone
solicitation or of refund, cancellation or exchange policies. The regulations
also require that a telemarketer identify promptly and clearly the seller on
whose behalf the representative is calling, the purpose of the call, and the
nature of the good or services offered.

        In December of 2002, the FTC amended the TSR. Excluding two provisions,
which are addressed below, the amended Rule becomes effective on October 1,
2003. The excluded provisions are as follows:

        1. Telemarketers must be able to transmit data that is readable by
        caller ID devices. The effective date for full compliance with the
        caller identification transmission provision is January 29, 2004.

        2. A centralized national Do Not Call (DNC) registry will be
        implemented. The effective date for full compliance with the national
        DNC list provision has not been announced, but this date may be as early
        as September 2003. AT&T has been awarded the contract to create the
        national list. A consumer who receives a telemarketing call despite
        being on the registry will be able to file a complaint with the FTC.
        Violators could be fined up to $11,000 per incident.

         The balance of the amended Rule gives the vendor two seconds from the
consumer's completed greeting to connect the call to the sales person.

         However, the FTC has provided a safe harbor provision for the "two
second" rule in that no enforcement action will be taken against a client or
vendor for violation if we meet the following standards designed to minimize
call abandonment:

        1. Telemarketers must employ technology that ensures no more than a 3%
        abandonment rate, measured per day per calling campaign.

        2. Telemarketers must allow each call placed to ring for at least 15
        seconds or four complete rings before disconnecting.

                                       3
<PAGE>

        3. Whenever a sales representative is not available within two seconds
        to speak to the consumer answering the call, we must promptly play a
        recorded message that contains the seller's name and telephone number.
        Failure to provide this recorded message will result in the call being
        considered abandoned, and it will be counted against the 3% daily
        maximum.

        4. Records, which prove telemarketers compliance of items one through
        three above, must be retained for 24 months.

        A number of states have enacted or are considering legislation to
regulate telemarketing. For example, several states impose license or bond
requirements upon telemarketers. There are also several states that publish and
maintain a state run "Do Not Call List." ACI subscribes to these lists. All
telephone numbers to be called by ACI are cross referenced against the "Do Not
Call" lists. "Do Not Call" numbers are then stricken from the lists of telephone
numbers to be called by us. From time to time, bills are introduced in the U.S.
Congress or state legislatures that could further regulate certain aspects of
the telemarketing business. We cannot predict whether any such proposed
legislation will become law or what affect such laws would have on our business.

        ACI is currently administering Do Not Call lists from over 24 states and
is technically and procedurally prepared to adhere to the amended Rule. To the
best of our knowledge, our telemarketing procedures comply with all state and
federal rules.

        Several of the industries served by us are subject to varying degrees of
government regulation, particularly the financial services industry. Clients in
these industries are obligated to provide us with scripts for our telemarketers,
which comply with applicable industry regulations. Although compliance with
these regulations is generally the responsibility of our clients, we could be
subject to a variety of enforcement or private actions for our failure or the
failure of our clients to comply with such regulations as the same relate to
telemarketing operations.

        CANADA

        In Canada, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications
Commission enforces rules regarding unsolicited communications using automatic
dialing and announcing devices, live voice and fax. Companies that violate any
of the restrictions on unsolicited calls may have their telephone service
terminated after two business days' notice from the telephone company.

        In 2001, the federal government of Canada enacted the Personal
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Federal Act). Effective
January 1, 2004, the Federal Act requires companies to obtain consent for the
collection, use, and disclosure of an individual's personal information. If the
Federal Act is determined to be applicable to us, it may have an adverse affect
on our current or future operations. The Federal Act permits any Province of
Canada to enact legislation governing the subject matter of the Federal Act, in
which case the legislation of the Province will apply. Our Canadian operations
are located in Quebec. The province of Quebec may enact legislation governing
the subject matter of the Federal Act. If the province of Quebec were to enact
such legislation, there can be no assurance that any such laws will not
adversely affect or limit our current or future operations.

        The Federal Competition Act contains a number of provisions that
regulate the conduct of telemarketers in Canada, in particular the manner in
which outbound calls are to be conducted. Failure to comply with such
legislation could adversely affect our business.

PERSONNEL

        As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 1,600 full and part-time

agreement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

1996, our Common Stock was not publicly traded. The following table sets forth
the high and low bid prices and the closing sales prices for our Common Stock as
reported by OTC Bulletin Board. The bid quotations represent interdealer prices
without retail mark-ups, mark-downs or commissions and may not necessarily

        On May 8, 2003, the aggregate market value of our Common Stock was
$635,963 based on the average of the closing bid and asked prices on that date.
As of May 8, 2003, we had approximately 150 shareholders of record. We estimate
that an additional 400 stockholders own stock held for their accounts at
brokerage firms and financial institutions (commonly known as "in street name").

        We have not paid cash dividends on our Common Stock since our initial
public offering of stock. The Board of Directors presently intends to retain
earnings for use in our business and does not anticipate paying cash dividends
on Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determinations as to the
payment of dividends will depend on our financial condition and such other
factors as are deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Our credit line
prohibits the payment of cash dividends without the lender's consent.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

        ACI provides telephone-based sales and marketing services primarily to
the telecommunications, publishing, and financial services industries. We
operate eight contact centers. Five of the contact centers are located in the
United States, and three are located in Quebec, Canada. Four of the United
States contact centers are located in Midwest states with one located in
California. The Canadian contact centers are located in Sherbrooke, Vaudreuil
and Caplan, Quebec. As of December 31, 2002, we had 801 outbound and inbound
calling workstations and approximately 1,600 full and part-time employees.

        Revenues from telemarketing services are recognized as these services
are performed and are generally based on an hourly rate. Certain telemarketing
service revenues are performance-based. Cost of services includes compensation
and commissions for telephone sales representatives, payroll taxes, and other
benefits associated with such personnel, telephone expenses, and other direct
costs associated with providing services to customers. Selling, general, and
administrative expenses include administrative, sales, marketing, occupancy,
depreciation, and other indirect costs.

        One of our strategies is to locate our contact centers in smaller, more
rural communities, because many of these communities offer higher quality labor
and reduced operating expenses, as well as, economic incentives for locating
facilities in their communities. We receive incentive payments from certain
federal, state, local, and provincial governments in the United States and
Canada that help offset payroll and start-up costs associated with opening new
customer contact centers.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        In preparing our financial statements, we follow accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, which in many cases require
assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. Many of
these policies are relatively straightforward. There are, however, a few
policies that are critical because they are important in determining the
financial condition and results of operations, and they can be difficult to
apply. The most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
Company's financial statements relate to:

        REVENUE RECOGNITION - We provide outbound and inbound telephone-based
sales and marketing services (outsourced services) for a variety of companies in
the telecommunications, financial services, and publishing industries. Outbound
telemarketing services are performed when our customer sales representatives
place a telephone call, from a list supplied by our client company, to a
telephone number at a personal residence or business location. Inbound
telemarketing services are performed when our customer sales representatives
receive a call, on a toll-free telephone number, from an individual or business
that is seeking to obtain information or purchase a product or service from our
client company.

        We recognize revenues from outbound and inbound services when those
services are provided. Revenue is recognized based on telemarketing hours
incurred or, if revenue is recognized on performance based criteria, when sales
are verified.

        Outbound and inbound services revenue is treated as one segment. Related
costs and expenses are not tracked separately because we do not have dedicated
inbound customer contact centers, we have no dedicated inbound telemarketing
personnel, and employees in our customer contact centers perform both

                                       8
<PAGE>

outbound and inbound telemarketing services.

        ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANTS - We receive incentive payments from certain
state, local and provincial governments in the United States and Canada to help
offset payroll and start-up costs associated with opening new customer contact
centers. These various governmental agencies reserve the right to require
repayment of all or a portion of the incentive payments if the Company does not
meet certain performance criteria as defined in the incentive agreements, such
as, creating a certain, or minimum, number of new jobs, maintaining certain
levels of employment over a period of time or paying minimum average salaries.

        Incentive payments are recorded as a reduction to payroll and start-up
expenses when performance criteria are satisfied. In the event that performance
criteria have been satisfied prior to receipt of the incentive payment, payroll
and start-up expenses are reduced and a receivable from the governmental agency
is recorded. If an incentive payment is received prior to the satisfaction of
all required performance criteria, the incentive payment is deferred and
recorded as a liability. If an incentive payment is received for which an
incremental portion of the performance criteria is satisfied then the
incremental portion of the incentive payment is recorded as a reduction to
payroll and start-up costs and the incremental portion of the incentive payment
not earned is deferred and recorded as a liability.

        LONG-LIVED ASSETS - We review our long-lived assets, such as fixed
assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the book value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
We consider a history of operating losses to be a primary indicator of potential
asset impairment. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest
level for which there are identifiable cash flows. Fixed assets or goodwill is
deemed to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows,
directly related to such assets, is less than its carrying amount.

        INCOME TAXES - We evaluate a variety of factors in determining the
amount of income tax assets and liabilities to be reported in our consolidated
balance sheets, including our earnings history, the number of years our
operating loss and tax credits can be carried forward, the existence of taxable
temporary differences, and near-term earnings expectations. In assessing our
ability to utilize deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

        We are committed to making cash payments in the future in connection
with operating leases, capital lease obligations (including principal and
interest), and our Revolving Credit and Forbearance Loan Agreement. We have no
off-balance sheet debt or other unrecorded obligations nor do we guarantee the
debt of any party. Below is a schedule of the future payments that we are
obligated to make based on agreements in place as of December 31, 2002 (amounts
in thousands).

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

        The following table sets forth items from ACI's Consolidated Statements
of Operations as percentages of total revenues:

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001

        REVENUES. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were
$30,320,788, a decrease of $2,573,128 or 8% when compared to 2001 revenues of
$32,893,916. The decreases in revenues and billable hours can primarily be
attributed to our financial services clients scaling back their marketing
campaigns due to the general instability of the economy during 2002.

        Telecommunications clients provided the largest portion of revenues
during 2002, providing approximately 46% of revenues compared to approximately
27% of revenues in 2001. During 2001, financial services clients provided 63% of
revenues compared to approximately 44% during 2002. Other industry segments and
their percentages of revenues in 2002 and 2001 included publishing (4% and 6%)
and other miscellaneous (6% and 4%), respectively. During 2002, the Company's
largest client represented 17% of total revenue. During 2001, the Company's
largest client represented 16% of total revenue.

        In 2002, billable telemarketing hours decreased 5% when compared to
2001; however, net revenue per billable telemarketing hour decreased by 3%.
During 2002, the Company opened one contact center in Caplan, Quebec, Canada. As
of December 31, 2002, the Company operated a combined total of 801 inbound and
outbound contact center workstations compared to 887 inbound and outbound call
center workstations at December 31, 2001.

        COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services increased 3% to $17,816,607 in 2002
from $17,342,050 in 2001. Telemarketing sales representatives (TSR's) labor and
benefit costs increased by 5% to $14,349,573, or 47% of total revenue in 2002 as
compared to $13,727,502, or 42% of total revenue in 2001. As a percentage of
revenue, long distance telephone costs increased from 10% in 2001 to 11% in
2002. Without the effect of the economic development grant reimbursements earned
(see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), cost of services
would have increased another $335,647 in 2002, to $18,152,254 compared to an
additional increase of $1,783,765 to $19,125,815 in 2001. Economic development
grant reimbursements earned are from the governments of Quebec and Canada for
new jobs created at the Company's Sherbrooke, Vaudreuil and Caplan contact
centers.

        SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general, and
administrative expenses for 2002 decreased by $792,316, or 5% to $14,291,900,
compared to $15,084,216 in 2001. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general,
and administrative expenses increased 1% to 47% in 2002 as compared to 46% in
2001. The increase in expenses in 2002, as a percentage of revenue, can
primarily be attributed to expenses associated with the June 2002 opening of our
new customer contact center in Caplan, Quebec; increased travel costs of
corporate personnel associated with the opening of our new customer contact
center; and upgraded technology installed during 2002 and 2001. During 2002,
there was no effect on selling, general and administrative expenses from
economic development grant reimbursements earned. During 2001, without the
effect of the economic development grant reimbursements earned (see Note 6 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), selling, general and administrative
expenses would have been $15,338,959. For 2001, selling, general and
administrative expenses were reduced by $254,743 for economic development grant
reimbursements earned.

        IMPAIRMENT COST. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a
non-cash impairment charge of $532,743 for the write-down of long-lived assets
related to the reduction of excess production capacity in our call centers.
During the third quarter of 2002, the Company also recorded a non-cash
impairment of asset charge of $49,975 related to the closing of two small call
centers. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a non-cash
impairment of asset charge of $78,202 related to the write-down of long-lived
assets of call centers sold during the first quarter of 2002.

        OPERATING INCOME (LOSS). As a result of the factors discussed above, the
Company recorded an operating loss in 2002 of $2,370,437 compared to 2001
operating income of $389,448. Operating losses for 2002 and 2001 would have been
$2,706,084 and $1,649,060, respectively, when the effect of the economic
development grant reimbursements earned is not considered.

        OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET. Other expenses were $248,905 in 2002
compared to $320,968 in 2001. Net interest expense of $210,098 in 2002,
decreased by $41,727 compared to net interest expense of $251,825 in 2001. This
decrease was the result of a decrease in borrowing activity under the Company's
line of credit and a reduction in equipment lease financing as a result of
leases becoming fully paid. Other expenses also decreased as a result of a
decrease in foreign currency translation expense when compared to 2001.

        INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company recorded income tax expense of $205,000
in 2002 compared to $27,000 in 2001. The 2002 provision is net of a $1,900,000
valuation allowance charge and a $568,000 benefit resulting from a change in
Canadian tax strategy. The 2002 expense was recorded at 7.8%, which is estimated
to be the effective rate for federal and state taxes verses 39.4% used in 2001.

        NET INCOME (LOSS). Net loss for 2002 was $2,824,342, or $0.49 per share
on a basic and diluted basis compared to net income of $41,480 or $0.01 per
share in 2001. When the effect of the economic development grants is not
considered, the net loss for 2002 would have been $3,184,989, or $0.55 per share
on a basic and diluted basis as compared to net loss for 2001 of $1,193,294, or
$0.21 per share on a basic and diluted basis.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000

        REVENUES. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were
$32,893,916, an increase of $1,398,577 or 4% when compared to 2000 revenues of
$31,495,339. The increases in revenues and billable hours can primarily be
attributed to increased internal capacity that was the result of opening a

                                       11
<PAGE>

new contact center in January 2001. Because of the increased capacity, revenues
derived from outsourcing in 2001 decreased to less than 1% compared to 13% in
2000.

        Financial services clients provided 63% and 51% of total 2001 and 2000
revenues, respectively. Other industry segments for 2001 included
telecommunications (27%) and publishing (6%). During 2001, the Company's largest
client represented 16% of total revenue. During 2000, the Company's largest
client represented 21% of total revenue.

        In 2001, billable telemarketing hours increased 9% when compared to
2000; however, net revenue per billable telemarketing hour decreased by 4%.
During 2001, the Company opened one contact center in Vaudreuil, Quebec, Canada.
As of December 31, 2001, the Company operated a combined total of 887 inbound
and outbound contact center workstations compared to 775 inbound and outbound
call center workstations at December 31, 2000.

        COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services decreased 2% to $17,342,050 in 2001
from $17,657,512 in 2000. The decrease in costs of services is primarily the
result of the 99% decrease in outsourcing costs. The reduced utilization of
outsourcing was due to the Company's increased internal capacity that was the
result of opening a new contact center in January 2001. Outsourcing costs are
costs associated with the utilization of other telemarketing companies for
telemarketing some of the Company's clients' programs. Outsourcing costs
decreased to less than 1%, as a percentage, of total revenue in 2001 compared to
11% of total 2000 revenue. Increases in TSR's labor and benefit costs and long
distance telephone costs partially offset the decrease in outsourcing costs.
TSR's labor and benefit costs increased by 22% to $13,727,502, or 42% of total
revenue in 2001 as compared to $11,247,055, or 36% of total revenue in 2000. As
a percentage of revenue, long distance telephone costs increased from 8% in 2000
to 10% in 2001. Without the effect of the economic development incentives of
$1,783,765 and $1,151,728 in 2001 and 2000, respectively, (see Note 6 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements), cost of services would have increased
$316,575 or 2% to $19,125,815 from $18,809,240 in 2000. For the year 2001, cost
of services was reduced by $1,783,765 for the economic development grants from
the governments of Quebec and Canada for new jobs created at the Company's
Sherbrooke and Vaudreuil contact centers. For the year 2000, cost of services
was reduced by $1,151,728 for the economic development grant from the government
of Quebec, Canada for new jobs created at the Company's Sherbrooke, Quebec
contact center.

        SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general, and
administrative expenses for 2001 increased by $3,539,641, or 31% to $15,084,216,
compared to $11,544,575 in 2000. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general,
and administrative expenses increased 9% to 46% in 2001 as compared to 37% in
2000. The increase in expenses in 2001 can primarily be attributed to expenses
associated with the contact centers that were opened in April 2000 and January
2001; an increase in costs of corporate personnel hired to handle increased
capacity and expansion of future product lines; and an increase in depreciation
expense associated with the contact centers opened in April 2000 and January
2001, relocation of the Merrillville, IN contact center to Schererville, IN, and
upgraded technology installed during 2001 and 2000. During 2001, without the
effect of the economic development grants (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements), selling, general and administrative expenses would have
been $15,338,959, an increase of $3,567,548, or 30%, as compared to 2000. For
2001 and 2000, selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by
$254,743 and $226,836, respectively, for the net economic development grants.

        IMPAIRMENT COST. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded
a non-cash impairment of asset charge of $78,202 related to the write-down of
long-lived assets during the first quarter of 2002. During the third quarter of
2000, the Company recorded an impairment of asset charge of

                                       12
<PAGE>

$846,745 related to goodwill recorded from its August 1997 acquisition. See
discussion in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

        OPERATING INCOME (LOSS). As a result of the factors discussed above, the
Company recorded operating income of $389,448 compared to 2000 operating income
of $1,446,507. Operating loss for 2001 would have been $1,649,060 and operating
income for 2000 would have been $67,943 when the effect of the economic
development grant is not considered.

        OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET. Other expenses were $320,968 in 2001
compared to $188,226 in 2000. Net interest expense of $251,825 in 2001 compared
to net interest expense of $178,138 in 2000 was the result of an increase in
borrowing activity under the Company's line of credit and an increase in
equipment lease financing. Other expenses increased due to an increase in
foreign currency translation expense as a result of the opening of two contact
centers in Canada; one in April 2000 and the other in January 2001.

        INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company recorded income tax expense of $27,000
in 2001 compared to $497,000 in 2000. The 2001 expense was recorded at 39.4%,
which is estimated to be the effective rate for federal and state taxes verses
39.5% used in 2000.

        NET INCOME (LOSS). Net income for 2001 was $41,480, or $0.01 per share
on a basic and diluted basis compared to net income of $761,281 or $0.13 per
share in 2000. When the effect of the economic development grants is not
considered, net loss for 2001 would have been $1,193,294, or $0.21 per share on
a basic and diluted basis as compared to net loss for 2000 of $72,773 or $0.01
per share on a basic and diluted basis.

        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

        At December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
$797,626 compared to $1,459,215 and $100,607 at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Cash used by operating activities in 2002 was $1,758,740, compared
to cash provided by operating activities of $6,729,210, and $1,725,318,
respectively, in 2001 and 2000. Cash used by operating activities in 2002 was
from the net loss of $2,824,342, and net changes in working capital components
of $1,221,190 (primarily an increase in trade receivables). Cash provided by
depreciation of $2,083,635, and other non-cash charges of $203,157 partially
offset the cash used by operating activities in 2002. Cash provided by operating
activities in 2001 was primarily from $4,384,453 of changes in working capital
components related to the cash received from trade and grant receivable,
depreciation of $2,106,281, net income of $41,480 and other non-cash charges of
$196,996. Cash provided by operating activities in 2000 was primarily from net
income of $761,281, plus depreciation of $1,320,660 and other noncash charges of
$1,081,976. Cash used by operating activities in 2000 was $1,438,599 of changes
in working capital components related to the growth of the Company.

        Net cash provided by investing activities in 2002 was $19,915, compared
to cash used by investing activities of $2,449,594 and $3,102,514 in 2001, and
2000, respectively. During 2002, cash provided by investing activities was
primarily from government reimbursements against property and equipment of
$388,645, which was partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of
$355,158 primarily related to the new Caplan contact center opened in June 2002.
The primary use of

                                       13
<PAGE>

cash by investing activities in 2001 was expenditures for property and equipment
of $3,056,539 related to the new Vaudreuil contact center opened in January 2001
and upgrades on equipment and technology, which was partially offset by a
decrease of $606,945 in deposits on equipment and technology. The primary use of
cash by investing activities in 2000 was expenditures for property and equipment
of $2,412,643 related to the opening of the Sherbrooke call center in April 2000
and deposits of approximately $544,000 on equipment for the setup of the new
Vaudreuil call center in January 2001 and the expansion of current call centers.

        Net cash provided by financing activities in 2002 was $1,077,237
compared to net cash used in 2001 of $2,921,009 and net cash provided by
financing activities in 2000 of $1,278,508. Net cash provided by financing
activities in 2002 consisted of net borrowings from the revolving line of credit
totaling $1,807,571. The primary use of cash by financing activities in 2002 was
repayments on capital leases of $730,334. During 2001, the primary use of cash
by financing activities was net repayments of $2,501,617 on the revolving line
of credit plus capital lease repayments of $628,660. These uses of cash were
offset by proceeds of $202,634 from equipment acquired through capital leases
and proceeds of $6,634 from the issuance of common stock in the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2000 consisted of
net borrowings from the revolving line of credit totaling $1,651,617 plus
proceeds of $14,824 from the issuance of common stock in the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan and exercise of stock options. The primary use of cash by
financing activities in 2000 was the repayments of long-term debt and capital
leases of $387,933. As a result, net cash and cash equivalents decreased
$661,588 in 2002, increased $1,358,607 in 2001 and decreased by $98,688 in 2000.

        We have historically used cash from operating activities including
public sector economic development grants, bank borrowings, capital leases, and
private sector financing as our primary sources of liquidity. Over the last
year, we have not generated sufficient cash from operating activities to meet
our liquidity requirements. In 2002, the Company financed its activities with
borrowings against its line of credit, grant monies received from the provincial
government of Quebec, Canada and the federal government of Canada, and the
financing of $414,784 of asset purchases through capital leases. As of December
31, 2002, we operated under a $2,700,000 Revolving Credit and Forbearance Loan
Agreement dated December 2002, that expires on April 30, 2003. The loan accrues
interest at the prime rate plus 3% on outstanding borrowings (prime rate was
4.25% and 4.75% at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively). Borrowings are
collateralized by certain trade receivables. In addition, the loan agreement
contains provisions requiring compliance with certain financial covenants based
upon total debt levels, tangible net worth, debt service, capital expenditures,
and working capital, including prohibiting the payment of cash dividends without
the bank's consent. In addition, the loan agreement limits the 2002 net loss.
The agreement further stipulates that during 2003, we will not have a net loss
of more than $400,000 as of January 31, 2003, and a cumulative net loss of more
than $600,000 as of the end of each month thereafter. At December 31, 2002, we
had outstanding borrowings of $1,807,571 under the Revolving Credit and
Forbearance Loan Agreement with an available credit line of $892,429. At
December 31, 2001, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit
Loan Agreement with an available credit line of $4,000,000.

        On April 29, 2003, we signed a Financing Agreement with a new lender
that provides a credit line of up to $3,500,000. The agreement expires on
January 29, 2004. Borrowings are limited to 80% of qualifying trade receivables.
Certain trade receivable, contract rights and other rights to payments,
equipment and general intangibles collateralize the note. The loan accrues
interest at the prime rate plus 3.5%. The agreement also requires a minimum
interest charge payable to the lender of $3,500 per month and also includes a 1%
origination fee.

                                       14
<PAGE>

        We believe that funds generated from future operations, amounts
available under our Financing Agreement, and amounts receivable from economic
development grants for new jobs created will be sufficient to finance our
current and future business operations, including working capital requirements.

OUTLOOK

        Certain of the statements contained in this section are "forward-looking
statements." The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a
"safe harbor" for certain forward-looking statements. This report on Form 10-K
and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that
reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties, which could cause future results to differ materially from those
expressed or implied by such statements. Readers are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as required under the
Federal securities laws and rules and regulation of the SEC, we undertake no
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements in
connection with new information or future events.

         We believe that telemarketing will remain an integral part of our
client's marketing budgets and that revenues will remain relatively stable in
2003. However, there is no assurance that businesses will continue to outsource
their telemarketing needs or that our marketing efforts will generate new
business. As is common in the telemarketing industry, our customer contracts do
not designate us as the client's exclusive service provider, do not assure us of
a specific level of revenue, and are terminable by the client on relatively
short notice and sometimes without penalty.

        During the past year, we have not generated sufficient cash flows from
operations to support our liquidity requirements. In 2002, we experienced a
decrease in revenues that was primarily due to our financial services clients
scaling back their marketing campaigns because of the general instability of the
economy. We also incurred a net loss of $2,824,342 in 2002 compared to net
income of $41,480 in 2001 after the effect of $335,647 and $2,038,508 in expense
reductions for economic development incentives earned in years 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Because of these factors, we have had to utilize our credit line
to meet our cash needs. At December 31, 2002, the remaining receivable under the
incentive agreements was $380,562. The various governmental agencies granting
the incentive payments reserve the right to require repayment of all or a
portion of the incentive payments, if we do not meet certain performance
criteria as defined in the incentive agreements, such as creating a certain, or
minimum, number of new jobs, maintaining certain levels of employment over a
period of time, or paying minimum average salaries. As of December 31, 2002, we
had created a total of 1,115 jobs that are subject to certain performance
criteria, for which we had filed financial reimbursement claims. As of December
31, 2002, the actual number of jobs existing was 885. We do not believe that any
economic development incentives received will be refundable. This belief depends
on our ability to meet designated job creation and other requirements, which in
turn depends on general business, economic and competitive conditions. Should we
be required to repay all, or any portion, of the economic incentives received it
could have a material adverse effect on our cash position.

        In addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business
operations, the forward-looking statements in this report on Form 10-K are also
subject to the following risks and uncertainties:

CLIENT CONCENTRATION; CONTRACT TERMS

        Substantial portions of our revenues are generated from a few key
clients. As noted in Part I, Item 1 "Business-Principal Customers," three
clients accounted for 41% of our 2002 revenues. In 2001, five clients accounted
for 66% of total revenue. As is common in the telemarketing industry, our
customer

                                       15
<PAGE>

contracts do not designate us as the client's exclusive service provider, do not
assure us of a specific level of revenue, and are terminable by the client on
relatively short notice and sometimes without penalty. In addition, the amount
of revenue we generate from a particular client is dependent upon the interest
of their customer in, and use of, the client's product or service. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to retain any of our larger clients or that
these clients will not reduce their call volumes due to a downturn in their
industries. A reduction in call volumes, or the loss of one or more significant
clients, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

        We are subject to an increasing amount of Governmental regulation in
both the United States and Canada. For example, several states impose license or
bond requirements upon telemarketers. There are also several states that publish
and maintain a state run "Do Not Call List." In addition, several of the
industries served by the Company are subject to varying degrees of governmental
regulation, particularly the financial services industry. We believe that our
telemarketing procedures comply with all current US and Canadian rules. Future
laws and regulations may require us to modify our operations in order to
effectively meet our clients' service requirements, and there can be no
assurance that additional regulations would not limit our activities or
significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. See Part I, Item I for
further discussion of Government Regulations.

COMPETITION; INTERNATIONAL CAPACITY

         As noted in Part I, Item 1 "Business-Competition," the telemarketing
industry is highly competitive, but also continues to be highly fragmented. A
number of our competitors have capabilities and resources equal to or greater
than ours, and there can be no assurance that additional competitors with
greater resources will not enter the industry. These include telemarketing firms
of various sizes, in house telemarketing organizations, and other forms of
marketing such as direct mail, television and radio.

         We also face competition from offshore locations that provide service
to our markets at reduced costs. The potential movement of business to offshore
locations, at reduced prices, may result in pressure on us to match rates,
thereby eroding gross profit margins, or resulting in the loss of business to
these competitors.

DEPENDENCE ON LABOR FORCE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES

         Our most significant operating cost is our labor force. Due to the
traditionally high turnover rates in the telemarketing industry, we are
constantly required to recruit and train new employees. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to recruit, train and retain a sufficient number
of qualified employees within our present wage structure. An increase in hourly
wages, incentives or unemployment taxes could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition.

         Our second largest operating cost is telecommunications. Our business
is dependent on telephone services provided by various local and long distance
companies. To reduce our exposure to rate fluctuations, we enter into contracts
with our telecommunications service providers. All contracts are subject to
renewal negotiations, which may result in increased rates. Any change to the
telecommunications market that would disrupt services or limit our ability to
obtain services at favorable rates could have an adverse impact on the Company.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

        In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 (SFAS 142), GOODWILL
AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. This statement requires that goodwill and
intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized. Instead of
amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, the
statement requires a test for impairment to be performed annually, or
immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. We
adopted the provisions of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, which did not have a
material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position,
and cash flow.

        In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 (SFAS 143), ACCOUNTING FOR
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. SFAS 143 was effective for the Company on January
1, 2003. SFAS 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for
an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. We do not
expect SFAS 143 to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

        In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 (SFAS 144), ACCOUNTING FOR
THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
While SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF
LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF, it retains many
of the fundamental provisions of that statement. SFAS 144 was effective for the
Company on January 1, 2002. During 2002, the Company recognized a non-cash
impairment charge of $49,975 related to the closing of two small call centers
and an additional non-cash impairment charge of $532,743 related to certain
long-lived assets whose carrying value was in excess of expected future cash
flows from the use of those assets.

        In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 (SFAS 146), ACCOUNTING FOR
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES, which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities.
SFAS 146 requires costs associated with the following restructuring activities
to be recognized and measured at fair value (except for one-time termination
benefits) and recorded when such changes occur: one-time termination benefits,
costs to terminate contracts other than capital leases, and costs to consolidate
facilities and/or relocate employees. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged.

INFLATION

        Inflation has not had a material impact on operating results, and the
Company does not expect it to have a significant impact in the future. However,
there can be no assurance that the Company's business will not be affected by
inflation in the future.

QUARTERLY RESULTS

        The telemarketing industry tends to be slower in the first and third
quarters of the year because client marketing and customer service programs are
typically slower in the post holiday and summer months. The Company has
experienced and expects to continue to experience quarterly variations in
revenues and operating income principally as a result of the timing of clients'
telemarketing campaigns,

                                       17

the commencement of new contracts, changes in the Company's revenue mix, and the
additional selling, general, and administrative expenses to acquire and support
such new business.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

        INTEREST RATE RISK - We have exposure to changing interest rates and are
not currently engaged in hedging activities to mitigate this risk. Interest on
the variable rate debt outstanding on our Revolving Credit and Forbearance Loan
Agreement bears interest at the bank's prime rate plus 3%. As the prime rate
increases or decreases our interest expense, on an annual basis, will also
increase or decrease accordingly. As of December 31, 2002, our indebtedness
under the Revolving Credit and Forbearance Loan Agreement was $1,807,571. Our
capital lease obligations represent fixed rate indebtedness with interest rates
ranging from 8.05% to 11.31%. We had $1,128,398 in capital lease obligations at
December 31, 2002.

        FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK - Transactions with international
customers are entered into in U.S. dollars, precluding the need for foreign
currency hedges. As a result, the exposure to market risk is not material.

        DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS - We have no history of, and do not anticipate
that in the future, investing in derivative financial instruments, derivative
commodity instruments or other such financial instruments.

        Financial statements and supplementary financial information specified
by this Item, together with the report of our independent public accountants

Board of Directors and Shareholders
ACI Telecentrics, Inc.
Minneapolis, Minnesota


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of ACI Telecentrics,
Inc. and subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2002, the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

ACI TELECENTRICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS - ACI Telecentrics, Incorporated (ACI)
     provides telephone-based sales and marketing services primarily to the
     telecommunications, publishing and financial services industries. ACI was
     established in 1987 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Since that time, the Company
     has opened additional contact center locations in Twin Valley, Minnesota;
     Valley City and Devils Lake, North Dakota; Redfield and Pierre, South
     Dakota; Chadron, Valentine, and Ogallala, Nebraska; Redding, California;
     Sherbrooke, Vaudreuil and Caplan, Quebec. The Company's contact center in
     Schererville, Indiana was acquired as a result of an acquisition in 1997.
     During 2002, ACI transferred certain assets and operations of the Valley
     City, Pierre and Ogallala contact centers to new owners. In addition, ACI
     closed contact centers in Redfield and Valentine because all five contact
     centers were outside of ACI's long-term operational strategy. In 2000, ACI
     established the wholly owned subsidiary Corporation ACI Telecentrics du
     Quebec, Inc.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements include
     the accounts of ACI and its wholly owned subsidiary after elimination of
     intercompany transactions.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenues from telemarketing services are recognized
     as services are provided, primarily based on hours incurred. Performance
     based revenues are recognized when sales are verified.

     Outbound telemarketing services are performed when our customer sales
     representatives place a telephone call, from a list supplied by our client
     company, to a telephone number at a personal residence or business
     location. Inbound telemarketing services are performed when our customer
     sales representatives receive a call, on a toll-free telephone number, from
     an individual or business that is seeking to obtain information or purchase
     a product or service from our client company.

     USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
     with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
     America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
     the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
     assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
     reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
     Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant management
     estimates relate to grant agreements accounting and the valuation allowance
     against net deferred income tax assets.

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Short-term investments, generally with an
     original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase, are
     classified as cash equivalents.

     The Company maintains cash accounts that, at times, may exceed federally
     insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses from maintaining
     cash accounts in excess of such limits. The Company does not believe that
     it is exposes to any significant credit risks on its cash accounts.

     TRADE RECEIVABLES AND CREDIT RISK - The Company generally does not require
     collateral or other security from clients. The Company reports receivables
     net of an allowance for doubtful accounts,

                                       25
<PAGE>

     which represents the Company's estimate of the amount of receivables that
     may not be collectible. The Company conducts periodic reviews of its
     clients' financial condition and payment practices, and uses various
     remedies where appropriate to minimize collection risks.

     The Company is dependent on several large clients for a significant portion
     of its revenue. The inability to collect amounts owed by one or more of
     these clients could have a material adverse effect on the financial
     position of the Company.

     ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANTS - The Company receives incentive payments from
     certain state, local and provincial governments in the United States and
     Canada to help offset payroll and start-up costs associated with opening
     new customer contact centers. These various governmental agencies reserve
     the right to require repayment of all or a portion of the incentive
     payments if the Company does not meet certain performance criteria as
     defined in the incentive agreements, such as, creating a certain, or
     minimum, number of new jobs, maintaining certain levels of employment over
     a period of time or paying minimum average salaries.

     Incentive payments are recorded as a reduction to payroll and start-up
     expenses when performance criteria are satisfied. In the event that
     performance criteria have been satisfied prior to receipt of the incentive
     payment, payroll and start-up expenses are reduced and a receivable from
     the governmental agency is recorded. If an incentive payment is received
     prior to the satisfaction of all required performance criteria, the
     incentive payment is deferred and recorded as a liability. If an incentive
     payment is received for which an incremental portion of the performance
     criteria is satisfied, then the incremental portion of the incentive
     payment is recorded as a reduction to payroll and start-up costs, and the
     incremental portion of the incentive payment not earned is deferred and
     recorded as a liability.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are carried at cost.
     Depreciation is based on the straight-line method over estimated useful
     lives of the assets, generally three to seven years for furniture and
     equipment and from three to ten years for leasehold improvements.

     GOODWILL - Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of
     an acquired business and the fair value of its net assets when accounted
     for by the purchase method. Goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis
     over 15 years. An impairment loss of $846,745 was recognized during 2000
     related to goodwill recorded from a 1997 acquisition.

     IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - The Company periodically reviews property
     and equipment to determine potential impairment by comparing the carrying
     values with estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of
     assets. Should the sum of the expected future cash flows be less than the
     carrying value, the Company would recognize an impairment loss.

     During 2002, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $532,743
     for the write-down of long-lived assets related to the reduction of excess
     production capacity in our call centers. In addition, the Company also
     recorded in 2002, a non-cash impairment of asset charge of $49,975 related
     to the closing of two small call centers.

     In 2001, the Company transferred certain assets and the operations of three
     of its smaller contact centers to new owners because the facilities were
     outside of the Company's long-term operational strategy, and, as a result,
     the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $78,202 in 2001 based
     on projected future cash flows on the assets to be transferred.

                                       26
<PAGE>

     FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The fair value of capital
     lease obligations approximates carrying value due to interest rates that
     approximate current market rates. The fair value of other financial
     instruments approximates the carrying value due to their short-term nature.

     INCOME TAXES - Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized
     for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
     financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
     respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
     using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
     which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
     Income tax expense is the tax payable for the year and the change in
     deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year.

     SEGMENT INFORMATION - The Company manages its business as one operating
     segment and does not separately track sources of costs and expenses related
     to outbound and inbound revenue.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS - Transactions with Canadian vendors and
     employees are recorded in U.S. dollars at the time of settlement.
     Accordingly, the Company has no foreign currency translation adjustments.

     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
     Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
     (SFAS) No. 142 (SFAS 142), GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. This
     statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an
     indefinite life not be amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and
     intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, the statement requires
     a test for impairment to be performed annually, or immediately if
     conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. SFAS 142 did not
     have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
     operations.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT
     OBLIGATIONS. SFAS 143 is effective on January 1, 2003. SFAS 143 requires
     entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
     obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The Company does not
     expect SFAS 143 to have a material effect on the Company's financial
     position or results of operations.

     In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT
     OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, which addresses financial accounting and
     reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. While SFAS
     144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED
     ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF, it retains many of the
     fundamental provisions of that statement. SFAS 144 was effective on January
     1, 2002 (see impairment of long-lived assets).

     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED
     WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES, which addresses financial accounting and
     reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. SFAS 146
     requires costs associated with the following restructuring activities to be
     recognized and measured at fair value (except for one-time termination

4.   REVOLVING CREDIT AND FORBEARANCE LOAN AGREEMENT

     The Company has a $2,700,000 Revolving Credit and Forbearance Loan
     Agreement dated December 2002, that expires on April 30, 2003. The loan
     accrues interest at the prime rate plus 3% on outstanding borrowings (prime
     rate was 4.25% and 4.75% at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively).
     Borrowings are collateralized by certain trade receivables. In addition,
     the loan agreement contains provisions requiring compliance with certain
     financial covenants based upon total debt levels, tangible net worth, debt
     service, capital expenditures, and working capital, including prohibiting
     the payment of cash dividends without the bank's consent. In addition, the
     loan agreement limits the 2002 net loss. The agreement further stipulates
     that during 2003, the Company will maintain a net loss of not more than
     $400,000 as of January 31, 2003, and a cumulative net loss of not more than
     $600,000 as of the end of each month thereafter. The Company has not
     obtained waivers for covenants for which it was not in compliance. At
     December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $1,807,571
     under the Revolving Credit and Forbearance Loan Agreement with an available
     credit line of $892,429. As a result, the Company is seeking an alternative
     lender to replace the current credit facility, and provide additional
     capital to meet current liquidity needs; however, there is no assurance
     that the Company can reach an agreement.

     Maximum borrowings on the credit facility were $2,540,899 and $3,494,375 in
     2002, and 2001, respectively. Average borrowings and the weighted average
     interest rate were $1,249,842 and $1,063,977, and 4.92% and 6.92% in 2002,
     and 2001, respectively.

6.   GRANT AGREEMENTS

     One of the Company's strategies is to locate its call centers in smaller,
     more rural communities because many of these communities offer higher
     quality labor and reduced operating expenses, as well as, economic
     incentives for locating facilities in their communities. The Company
     receives incentive payments from certain state, local, and provincial
     governments in the United States and Canada to help offset payroll and
     start-up costs associated with opening new customer contact centers. These
     various governmental agencies reserve the right to require repayment of all
     or a portion of the incentive payments if the Company does not meet certain
     performance criteria as defined in the incentive agreements, such as
     creating a certain, or minimum, number of new jobs, maintaining certain
     levels of employment over a period of time, or paying minimum average
     salaries.

     Incentive payments are recorded as a reduction to payroll and start-up
     expenses when performance criteria are satisfied. In the event that
     performance criteria have been satisfied prior to receipt of the incentive
     payment, payroll and start-up expenses are reduced and a receivable from
     the governmental agency is recorded. If an incentive payment is received
     prior to the satisfaction of all required performance criteria, the
     incentive payment is deferred and recorded as a liability. If an incentive
     payment is received for which a portion of the performance criteria is
     satisfied, then the payment is recorded as a reduction to payroll and
     start-up costs for the year, and the portion of the payment not earned is
     deferred and recorded as a liability.

     To this extent, the Company undertakes a rigorous analysis of each
     government grant, which it receives. Each grant has its own distinct terms
     because of the different government jurisdictions involved. Each grant is
     accounted for separately in accordance with the preceding criteria and its
     grant terms so as to appropriately match all incentive payments with the
     respective payroll and start-up expenses.

     CAPLAN, QUEBEC CANADA
     PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC - During the second quarter of 2002, the
     Company entered into a financial incentives agreement with the Government
     of Quebec, Canada. Under the agreement the Company agreed to open a contact
     center in Caplan, Quebec for certain financial incentives. To receive
     financial incentives the Company must create a minimum of 50 jobs by April
     30, 2004, but can create up to 500 jobs for which it will receive incentive
     payments. These incentives are based on maintaining certain eligibility
     requirements for each job created, including a minimum number of hours
     worked per week and maintaining minimum average annual salaries. In
     addition, for each job that the Company receives a financial contribution,
     the agreement requires that the job be maintained for a minimum period of
     two years from the date of its creation.

     As of December 31, 2002, the Company created 180 jobs and received
     reimbursement for 164 of those jobs created. At December 31, 2002, the
     receivable under the agreement was $56,732. Should future employment levels
     fall below the 180, the provincial government reserves the right to apply a
     proportionate amount of the financial contribution already paid toward the
     replacement of each new job once employment levels exceed 180. The
     proportionate amount is defined as the number of months remaining in the
     24-month job existence requirement at the time employment levels fell below
     180, divided by 24 months. Due to this provision, the Company is reducing
     payroll costs for each of the 180 jobs created evenly over 24 months from
     the date that each job is created. During 2002, the Company reduced payroll
     costs by a total of $102,669 for the portion of the financial incentives
     earned. The Company recorded a deferred grant expense reimbursements
     liability of $463,468 as of December 31, 2002, for the portion of the
     financial incentives not earned.

     EMPLOI QUEBEC - During the second quarter of 2002, the Company entered into
     a financial incentive agreement, which under the terms of the agreement,
     Emploi Quebec agreed to subsidize up to 50% of wages for the first 40 weeks
     of employment for each new employee, training costs and human resources
     management costs for two years. The financial incentive is linked to the
     creation of up to 500 jobs at the Company's new customer contact center
     located in Caplan, Quebec. During 2002, the Company recorded $184,676 as a
     reduction to payroll costs. At December 31, 2002, the receivable under this
     agreement was $54,636.

     VAUDREUIL, QUEBEC CANADA
     PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC - During the first quarter of 2001, the
     Company entered into a financial incentive agreement with the Government of
     Quebec, Canada. Under the agreement the Company agreed to open a contact
     center in Vaudreuil, Quebec, for certain financial incentives. To receive
     financial incentives the Company must create a minimum of 50 jobs by
     October 15, 2002, but can create up to 626 jobs for which it will receive
     incentive payments. These incentives are based on maintaining certain
     eligibility requirements for each job created, including a minimum number
     of hours worked per week and maintaining minimum average annual salaries.
     In addition, for each job that the Company receives a financial incentive,
     the agreement requires that the job be maintained for a minimum period of
     three years from the date of its creation.

     As of December 31, 2002, the Company filed financial reimbursement claims
     for 389 jobs created for which it has received reimbursement for 348 of
     those jobs. At December 31, 2002, $186,891 in incentives is receivable
     under the agreement. As of December 31, 2002, the actual number of jobs
     existing at the contact center was 291. According to the terms of the
     agreement, the provincial government reserves the right to apply financial
     incentives already paid toward new jobs should employment levels fall below
     the total number of jobs for which it has already reimbursed the Company.
     As a result of current employment levels being lower than the number of
     jobs for which the Company has received financial incentives, the Company
     has a deferred grant expense reimbursements liability of $527,939 as of
     December 31, 2002. Increases in future employment levels will allow the
     Company to reduce additional payroll costs and reduce the deferred grant
     expense reimbursements liability. During 2002, the Company did not record
     any reduction in payroll costs under this agreement. This compares to a
     reduction in payroll costs of $1,085,278 during 2001.

     SHERBROOKE, QUEBEC CANADA
     FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF CANADA - During the first quarter of 2001, the
     Company entered into a financial incentives agreement with the Federal
     Government of Canada. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to create 437
     fulltime equivalent jobs by March 31, 2002. During 2002, the Company
     recorded $48,302 in reductions to payroll costs compared to $781,714 during
     2001. Payment of all incentive amounts have been received.

     PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC TRAINING GRANT -During the first quarter of
     2001, the Company entered into a financial incentive agreement, which under
     the terms of the agreement, the Provincial Government of Quebec agreed to
     subsidize up to 50% of certain training costs associated with the opening
     of the Sherbrooke contact center. Reductions in startup expenses were $0
     and $107,780 in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC - During the year ended 2000, the Company
     entered into a financial incentives agreement with the Government of
     Quebec, Canada. Under the agreement the Company agreed to open a contact
     center in Sherbrooke, Quebec, for certain financial incentives.

                                       31
<PAGE>

     To receive financial incentives the Company must create a minimum of 50
     jobs by March 14, 2002, but can create up to 600 jobs for which it will
     receive incentive payments. These incentives are based on maintaining
     certain eligibility requirements for each job created, including a minimum
     number of hours worked per week and maintaining minimum average annual
     salaries. In addition, for each job that the Company receives a financial
     incentive, the agreement requires that the job be maintained for a minimum
     of two years from the date of its creation.

     As of December 31, 2002, the Company filed financial reimbursement claims
     for 546 jobs created for which it received reimbursement for 526 of those
     jobs. At December 31, 2002, the receivable under the agreement was $82,303.
     As of December 31, 2002, the actual number of jobs existing at the contact
     center was 414. According to the terms of the agreement, the provincial
     government reserves the right to apply financial incentives already paid
     toward new jobs should employment levels fall below the total number of
     jobs for which it has already reimbursed the Company. As a result of
     current employment levels being lower than the number of jobs for which the
     Company has received financial incentives, the Company has a deferred grant
     expense reimbursements liability of $531,803 as of December 31, 2002.
     Increases in future employment levels will allow the Company to reduce
     additional payroll costs and reduce the deferred grant expense
     reimbursements liability. During 2002, the Company did not record any
     reduction in payroll costs under this agreement. This compares to a
     reduction in payroll costs of $63,736 during 2001.

     STOCK OPTION PLAN - The Company has a Stock Option Plan (Stock Option
     Plan), which reserved 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock in the
     form of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options for
     employees and investors. The Stock Option Plan requires that the exercise
     price of all options granted be the fair market value of the Company's
     common stock on the date of grant. Vesting and exercise periods for
     individual options vary by grant.

     The Company adopted SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION,
     and elected to continue following the accounting guidance of Accounting
     Principles Board Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES,
     for measurement and recognition of stock-based transactions with employees.
     No compensation cost was recognized for options issued under the Stock
     Option Plan because the exercise price of all options granted was at least
     equal to the fair value of the common stock on the grant date. Had
     compensation cost for the stock options been determined based on the fair
     value at the grant date, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123,
     the Company's pro forma net income (loss) and per share amounts would have

     STOCK WARRANTS - On October 21, 1996, warrants to purchase 140,000 shares
     of common stock were issued in connection with the initial public offering.
     The warrants expired on October 21, 2001. The warrants had an exercise
     price of $6.00 per share. No warrants were exercised.

9.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS - Each of the two majority shareholders entered into
     an employment agreement with the Company providing a minimum annual base
     salary of $175,000. These agreements have automatic one-year extensions,
     unless terminated in writing. The agreements require the Company to pay
     premiums for life insurance intended to fund the buy/sell agreements to
     which the two majority shareholders are parties. If employment is
     terminated by either party, the two majority shareholders will receive 12
     months' salary and health benefits. These agreements require each of the
     two majority shareholders to vote his shares for election of the other to
     serve on the Company's Board of Directors. Each of these agreements include
     confidentiality protections and prohibits each of the two majority
     shareholders from competing with the Company for a period equal to the
     period during which the Company is obligated to make severance payments.

     BUY/SELL AGREEMENTS - Each of the two majority shareholders has entered
     into a Buy/Sell Agreement with the Company and each other. Under this
     agreement, the Company has the option to purchase shares from the two
     shareholders.

     CONTINGENCIES - The Company is also involved in legal actions in the
     ordinary course of its business. Although the outcomes of any such legal
     actions cannot be predicted, management believes that there is no pending
     legal proceeding against or involving the Company for which the outcome is
     likely to have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial
     position or results of operations.

                                                                   ============     ============
</TABLE>

     The 2002 net deferred tax assets are included with other assets on the
     balance sheet.

     During 2002, the Company changed its strategy regarding Canadian income
     taxes resulting in approximately $568,000 in reduced income taxes. Since
     realization of deferred tax assets associated with the net operating loss
     carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior
     to their expiration, management has provided a valuation allowance at
     December 31, 2002, against all US federal and state net deferred tax
     assets, which was a $1,900,000 increase over December 31, 2001.

     As of December 31, 2002, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards
     for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $3,000,000. The net
     operating loss carryforwards will expire beginning in 2018. In addition, at
     December 31, 2002, the Company had tax credits of approximately $698,000,
     which will expire beginning in 2017.

     State tax effects are deemed insignificant and are not separately disclosed
     in most areas.

11.  RETIREMENT PLAN

     The Company has a 401(k) pension plan covering substantially all of its
     employees who are at least 21 years of age and have completed at least nine
     months continuous employment. Participants may elect to defer from 1% to
     15% of their salary and are 100% vested in their own contributions. The

                                       36
<PAGE>

     plan allows for the Company to make discretionary matching contributions.
     These contributions, if any, vest to the employee at 20% per year of
     employment so that the employee will be fully vested in the Company's
     discretionary contribution upon attaining five years of employment of
     greater than 1000 hours per year. The Board of Directors determines the
     Company's discretionary contributions to the plan annually. Discretionary
     contributions were $15,318 for the year ended December 31, 2000. There were
     no discretionary contributions made in 2002 or 2001.

12.  NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

     Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing earnings available to
     common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
     during the year. Diluted earnings per share are computed after giving
     effect to the exercise of all dilutive outstanding options and warrants.
     Both basic and diluted earnings per share for 2001 and 2000 were the same
     because the exercise price of substantially all options and warrants was in
     excess of the weighted average market price during the year. Because of the
     net loss in 2002, all options were antidilutive and excluded from the
     calculation. For the reasons discussed above, options and warrants of
     811,500, 243,750, and 140,000 were excluded from the calculation of diluted
     shares outstanding in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The following
     table reconciles the denominators used in computing basic and diluted
     earnings per share for the years ended December 31:

13.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On April 29, 2003, the Company signed a Financing Agreement with a new
     lender that provides a credit line of up to $3,500,000. The agreement
     expires on January 29, 2004. Borrowings are limited to 80% of qualifying
     trade receivables. Certain trade receivables, contract rights and other
     rights to payments, equipment and general intangibles collateralize the
     note. The loan accrues interest at the prime rate plus 3.5%. The agreement
     also requires a minimum interest charge payable to the lender of $3,500 per
     month and also includes a 1% origination fee.

     On April 7, 2003, the Company announced that it is negotiating an agreement
     to transfer its Redding, California contact center to another company. The
     Company expects to continue its operations at the site over next few months
     until the transfer is completed. As a result of the transfer, the Company
     expects to incur a loss of $250,000 related to the disposal of assets.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
        FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

     On December 9, 2002, Deloitte & Touche LLP resigned as ACI's independent
accountant. We had engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent accountant
for prior fiscal years.

     There were not, in connection with the audits of the two most recent fiscal
years and any subsequent interim period preceding the resignation of Deloitte &
Touche LLP, any disagreements between the Registrant and Deloitte & Touche LLP,
on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Deloitte &
Touche LLP's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject
matter of the disagreement in connection with its report. Deloitte & Touche
LLP's audit reports on the financial statements of ACI for the two years ended
December 31, 2001, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion
or been qualified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, nor
were there any other events requiring disclosure.

Effective December 23, 2002, our Board of Directors, upon recommendation of our
Audit Committee, engaged Lurie Besikof Lapidus & Company, LLP as the
Registrant's independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2002.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's
officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10 percent of a registered
class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and
changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than
ten-percent shareholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company
with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on its review,
the Company believes that, during fiscal year 2002, officers Lois Dirksen and

for options granted to them during the year.

COMPENSATION TO DIRECTORS

     Non-employee members of the Board of Directors receive a per-meeting
payment of $750 for formal meetings. In addition, the Board of Directors has
granted nonqualified options to purchase shares of Common Stock. Mr. Franchot
was granted 8,000 shares and Mr. Levin and Mr. Levy were each granted 6,000
shares. All these options became exercisable immediately.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS

     Each of Mr. Diamond and Mr. Cohen has entered into an employment agreement
dated June 30, 1996, with the Company. These agreements have an initial term of
two years with automatic one year extensions, unless terminated in writing
within sixty (60) days prior to the renewal date. The agreements provide for a
minimum annual base salary, currently at $300,000. If employment is terminated
by either party following the initial two-year term, Mr. Diamond and Mr. Cohen
will receive 12 months salary and health benefits. These agreements require each
of Mr. Diamond and Mr. Cohen to vote his shares for election of the other to
serve on the Company's Board of Directors. Each of these agreements includes
strict confidentiality protections and prohibits each of Mr. Diamond and Mr.
Cohen from competing with

                                       45
<PAGE>

the Company for a period equal to the period during which the Company is
obligated to make severance payments.

        Each of Mr. Diamond and Mr. Cohen has entered into a Buy/Sell Agreement
with the Company and each other. These Agreements give each of Mr. Diamond and
Mr. Cohen the option to purchase shares of the Company's stock from the other in
the event the other dies, attempts a voluntary sale of stock, or is subject to a
possible involuntary transfer of the stock. In addition, these Agreements
require each of Mr. Diamond and Mr. Cohen to maintain life insurance on each
other and to use the proceeds thereof to purchase shares from the decedent's
estate at fair market value. The Company has an option to purchase any shares
not purchased by Mr. Diamond or Mr. Cohen, as the case may be. In all instances,
purchase options are at fair market value, as measured by the average market
price of the Company's publicly traded common stock over a period of 90 days
prior to the event giving rise to an option.

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

        The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors consists of
directors who are not employees of the Company. The Committee is currently
comprised of Douglas W. Franchot, Seymour Levy and Phillip T. Levin. This
Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the Company's compensation
policies and recommends to the Board of Directors the salaries to be paid to
executive officers of the Company and any plan for additional compensation it
deems appropriate. In addition, this Committee is vested with the same authority
as the Board of Directors with respect to the granting of options and the
administration of the Company's 1996 Stock Option Plan.

SALARY

        Mr. Diamond's compensation for serving as Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, including salary and benefit, is and will generally be governed by the
terms of his employment agreement with the Company. See "Employment Agreements
and Buy/Sell Agreements" set forth above. The Compensation Committee determined,
after consideration of competitive levels of compensation for chief executive
officers of industry competitors, knowledge and experience of the telemarketing
industry, his contribution to the Company's growth and success and as one of its
two founding members, the financial performance of the Company during the prior
year and the financial condition of the Company, to maintain his base salary at
the same level as at the end of the previous year. In determining Mr. Diamond's
bonus potential for the year 2002, the Committee established that Mr. Diamond
would receive a bonus equal to 5 percent (5%) of the Company's 2002 EBITDA that
was in excess of year 2001 EBITDA.

        Mr. Cohen's compensation for serving as President of the Company,
including salary and benefit, is and will generally be governed by the terms of
his employment agreement with the Company. See "Employment Agreements and
Buy/Sell Agreements" set forth above. The Compensation Committee determined,
after consideration of competitive levels of compensation for presidents of
industry competitors, knowledge and experience of the telemarketing industry,
his contribution to the Company's growth and success and as one of its two
founding members, the financial performance of the Company during the prior year
and the financial condition of the Company, to maintain his base salary at the
same level as at the end of the previous year. In determining Mr. Cohen's bonus
potential for the year 2002, the Committee established that Mr. Cohen would
receive a bonus equal to 5 percent (5%) of the Company's 2002 EBITDA that was in
excess of year 2001 EBITDA.

        The Compensation Committee determined that salaries for remaining
executive officers of the Company will continue to be set at levels that are
intended to reward achievement of individual and Company goals and to motivate
and retain highly qualified executives whom the Committee believes are

                                       46
<PAGE>

important to the success of the Company. While these compensation decisions are
not based on strict formulas, the Committee considers various measures of
individual and Company performance and financial condition in establishing these
salaries. Bonuses are typically calculated at a certain percentage of each
executive's base salary only when the Company's actual performance exceeds
budgetary goals.

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

As with salary and bonuses, decisions regarding incentive compensation, in the
form of grants of stock options, are not based on strict formulas but are based
on several factors including individual and Company performance. The
Compensation Committee awarded stock options totaling 40,000 shares to two of
the named executive officers in 2002.

STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH

        The following performance graph compares the cumulative shareholder
return on our Common Stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index and an index of peer group companies consisting of teleservices
companies for the period from December 31, 1997 to December 31, 2002. This graph
assumes that $100 was invested in the Common Stock, the S&P 500 Index and the
peer group index on December 31, 1997 and that any dividends were reinvested.

        This peer group is one with which our management believes ACI to be
most aligned and consists of the following: APAC Teleservices, Inc.; ICT Group,
Inc.; RMH Teleservices, Inc.; Sitel Corp; Teletech Holdings, Inc.; and West
Teleservices Corp.

ITEM 14. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

        Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial and Accounting Officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and
procedures within the 90 days preceding the date of this filing. Under rules
promulgated by the SEC, disclosure controls and procedures are defined as those
"controls or other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports filed or
submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and
forms." Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
management determined that such controls and procedures were effective as of the
evaluation date.

        Since the evaluation date there have not been any significant changes in
the internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses.
