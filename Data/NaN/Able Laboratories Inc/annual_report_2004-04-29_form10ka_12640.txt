EXPLANATION FOR THIS AMENDMENT:

         Able's 2003 Form 10-K, as originally filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on March 15, 2004, incorporated the
information required by Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Form 10-K by reference to
our definitive proxy statement for our 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We
originally expected to file the proxy statement with the Commission within 120
days of the close of the fiscal year; however, we are not filing our definitive
proxy statement at this time because the board of directors expects to propose
an additional nominee for election to the board at the annual meeting.
Accordingly, the 2003 Form 10-K is being amended hereby for the sole purpose of
including the information set forth herein. Additionally, the certifications of
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are being filed with
this amendment pursuant to Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange Act. Items
10, 11, 12 and 13 in Part III of the 2003 Form 10-K are hereby amended by
deleting the texts thereof in their entirety and substituting therefor the

         SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

         Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent
of a registered class of equity securities, to file reports of ownership and
changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers,
directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by Securities
and Exchange Commission regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms
they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by
us, we believe that during fiscal 2003 all of our officers, directors and
greater-than-ten percent stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing
requirements and disclosed all transactions required to be disclosed.

         STOCKHOLDER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NOMINATION FOR ELECTION TO THE BOARD

         The nominating committee of the board of directors will consider
director candidates recommended by stockholders. The committee has not adopted
any particular method that stockholders must follow to make a recommendation. We
suggest that stockholders make recommendations by writing to the chairman of our
nominating committee, in care of our offices, with sufficient information about
the candidate, his or her work experience, his or her qualifications for
director, and his or her references as will enable the committee to evaluate the
candidacy properly. Any recommendations should also be made well in advance of
the anticipated mailing date of the proxy statement relating to any election of
directors, in order to provide our nominating committee an adequate opportunity
to complete a thorough evaluation of the proposed candidate. Section 3 of our
by-laws requires that a stockholder who wishes to propose an item of business
for consideration at the annual meeting of stockholders must give us written
notice of such item of business not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days
before the date for such meeting describing any proposal to be brought before
such meeting.

         CODE OF ETHICS

         We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our employees,
executive officers and directors, including our principal executive officer and
our principal financial accounting officer. The code of ethics includes
provisions covering compliance with laws and regulations, insider trading
practices, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, protection and proper use of
our assets, accounting and record keeping, fair competition and fair dealing,
business gifts and entertainment, payments to government personnel and the
reporting of illegal or unethical behavior. The code of ethics is posted on our
website. Any waiver of any provision of the code of ethics granted to an
executive officer or director may only be made by the board of directors and
will be promptly disclosed on our website at www.ablelabs.com.

         The following table provides information concerning stock options
exercised during fiscal 2003 and stock options held at December 31, 2003 by the
executive officers named in the summary compensation table.

         The value realized upon exercise of an option is based on the last sale
price of the common stock on the date of exercise, as reported by the Nasdaq
National Market, less the applicable option exercise price. The value of
unexercised in-the-money options at fiscal year-end is based on $18.07 per
share, the last sale price of our common stock on December 31, 2003, as reported
on the Nasdaq National Market. Actual gains, if any, will depend on the value of
the common stock on the date of the sale of the shares underlying the options.

         The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31,
2003, regarding securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation
plans, including individual compensation arrangements. We have two equity
compensation plan that have been approved by our stockholders, the 1998 Stock
Option Plan and the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan. Additionally, we have from time
to time granted non-qualified options to officers, directors and employees. The
"equity compensation arrangements not approved by security holders" in the table

                                        7
<PAGE>
below consist of shares issuable under our Consultant Stock Plan and individual
option grants. Our Consultant Stock Plan authorized the issuance of common stock
to non-employee consultants or other persons rendering services to us. Also, as
of December 31, 2003, 68 of our employees and directors held a total of 114
individual option grants to purchase an aggregate of 1,762,535 shares of common
stock at a weighted average exercise price of $4.59. The options have terms of
up to ten years and generally vest over one to five years. Generally, employee
options may not be exercised after (i) termination by us for cause; (ii) thirty
days following termination by us without cause or voluntary termination by the
optionee; or (iii) in the event of the optionee's permanent and total disability
or death, the earlier of the expiration date of the option or one year following
the date of such disability or death. The options are otherwise comparable to
options granted under our stockholder-approved equity compensation plan. Under
rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, with limited exceptions all option grants to
employees, officers and directors are now made only under stockholder-approved
plans.

                       AGREEMENTS WITH EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

         DHANANJAY G. WADEKAR. We entered into an employment agreement with Mr.
Wadekar in May 2002 relating to his service as our president and chief executive
officer, at an initial base salary of $250,000. Mr. Wadekar's salary is subject
to annual review and adjustment by the compensation committee. Mr. Wadekar is
also eligible to receive an annual bonus in an amount determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Mr. Wadekar's employment
agreement provides for, among other things, that for a period of one year after
his employment with us ends under certain circumstances, he will not engage in
any business activity which is in competition with our business. In the event
that we terminate Mr. Wadekar's employment without cause or Mr. Wadekar
terminates his employment for "good reason" (defined in his employment agreement
only as failure to be elected as president and chief executive officer, failure
to be compensated as set forth in his employment agreement, our failure to
maintain an office within 25 miles of Boston, any material reduction in
responsibilities or an otherwise material breach of his employment agreement),
we will be obligated to pay him an amount equal to the sum of: (a) his base
salary earned through the date of his termination, (b) his pro rata share (based
on the portion of the year during which he was employed) of the larger of the
highest annual bonus paid during the three fiscal years preceding his
termination or 20% of his current annual compensation, and (c) his deferred
compensation.

         ROBERT WEINSTEIN. We entered into an amended and restated employment
agreement with Mr. Weinstein in March 2004 relating to his service as our vice
president and chief financial officer for an initial term of three years at an

participate in any bonus plan as we may maintain in effect from time to time on
a basis substantially equivalent to other members of the Corporation's senior
management, and to participate in our employee fringe benefit plans or programs
generally available to our employees. In the event that we terminate Mr.
Weinstein without cause, we will pay him severance in an amount equal to three
months' base salary.

         KONSTANTIN OSTAFICIUK. We entered into an amended and restated
employment agreement with Mr. Ostaficiuk in March 2004 to serve as our vice
president of sales and marketing for an initial term of three years at an

annual base salary of $200,000. He is also eligible to receive a bonus based on
his incremental net sales to certain customers. Mr. Ostaficiuk participates in
our employee fringe benefit plans or programs generally available to our
employees. In the event that we terminate Mr. Ostaficiuk without cause, we will
pay him severance in an amount equal to three months' base salary. If we undergo
a change in control, and Mr. Ostaficiuk is terminated without cause, we will pay
him 12 months of severance in an amount equal to his base salary, the pro rata
portion of any bonus due and any additional options that would have been granted
to Mr. Ostaficiuk.

         SHAILESH V. DAFTARI. We entered into an amended and restated employment
agreement with Mr. Daftari in March 2004 whereby he will serve as our executive

PERFORMANCE GRAPH

         The following performance graph compares the performance of Able
Laboratories' cumulative stockholder return with that of one broad market index,
the Russell 2000 index, and a published industry or line of business index, the
Nasdaq Pharmaceutical Index. The cumulative stockholder return for the shares of
our common stock is calculated assuming $100 was invested on December 31, 1998.
The cumulative stockholder returns for the market indexes are calculated
assuming $100 was invested on December 31, 1998. We paid no cash dividends to
our holders of common stock during the periods shown. The performance of the
market indexes is shown on a total return (dividends reinvested) basis.

         In past years, we used the Nasdaq National Market Index for U.S.
Companies as the broad market index for comparison purposes. That index is also
shown on the graph below. We elected to switch to the Russell 2000 index this
year after Able was added to the Russell 2000 index in 2003.

         BOARD COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         This report has been furnished by the compensation committee consisting
of Elliot F. Hahn, Ph.D., Harry Silverman and Jerry I. Treppel, three
non-employee members of the board of directors, who served as the members of the
committee. The committee is primarily responsible for the review of executive
compensation, which includes base salary and stock option awards.

         COMPENSATION POLICIES. Able Laboratories believes that it is critical
to its continued success to attract and retain highly qualified executive
officers who will play a vital role in future achievements. To this end, Able
Laboratories has established its compensation policy to reward management based
upon corporate, departmental and individual performance, which is measured
against the internal goals set for each area. Able Laboratories also understands
the need to provide long-term incentives to its executive officers to achieve
future financial and strategic goals which include Able Laboratories' growth,
and enhancement of Able Laboratories' profitability. Able Laboratories believes
that its total compensation is sufficiently competitive to retain and, if
necessary, attract executive officers capable of leading Able Laboratories in
accomplishing its business goals.

         Executive compensation for fiscal 2003 consisted primarily of a base
salary and equity-based long-term incentive compensation in the form of
nonstatutory stock options. Since options granted generally vest over one to
five-years, option awards encourage the holders to improve the profitability and
shareholder value of Able Laboratories.

         BASE SALARIES AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION. The salaries of
the executive officers are established annually by evaluating requirements of
the position, the contribution of the individual executive with respect to Able
Laboratories' performance and the executive's responsibility, technical
experience and future potential. Base salaries of the executive officers are
generally adjusted annually in January to reflect comparable executive salaries
for comparably sized companies and to maintain the objectives of the
compensation policy noted above. In determining base salaries, the compensation
committee relies upon independent surveys of companies in the industry to
determine whether Able Laboratories' executive compensation is in a competitive
range for executives within Able Laboratories' industry. The annual salary of
Dhananjay G. Wadekar, Able Laboratories' chief executive officer, for fiscal
2003 was $250,000.

         LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. One of Able Laboratories' goals is
the enhancement of shareholder value. The principal incentive tool used to
achieve this goal is the periodic award to key employees of options to purchase
common stock. Able Laboratories' stock option plans are long-term plans designed
to link executive rewards to shareholder value over time. In fiscal 2003, Able
Laboratories granted long-term incentive compensation in the form of
non-statutory stock options to Able Laboratories' executive officers. These
grants included options granted to Mr. Daftari to purchase up to 35,000 shares
of our common stock, to Mr. Shah to purchase up to 35,000 shares of our common
stock and to Mr. Ostaficiuk to purchase up to 20,000 shares of our common stock.

                                         SUBMITTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
                                         OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         AUDIT-RELATED FEES. Audit-related fees represent fees for assurance and

performance of the audit or review of our financial statements, as well as
services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory
filings or engagements. For fiscal 2003, these services included services

         PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         At present, it is the practice of our audit committee to approve each
engagement for audit or non-audit services before we engage our independent
auditor to provide those services. The Audit Committee may delegate approval
authority to its Chair from time to time. Also, our audit committee has
established pre-approval policies and procedures in accordance with SEC
regulations, describing the specific audit, audit-related, tax and all other
services that have been pre-approved by the committee. The term of any general
pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless our audit
committee specifically provides for a different period. Our audit committee will
annually review the pre-approval policies and procedures and the services that
may thus be provided by our independent auditors, and will revise the list of
pre-approved services from time to time based on subsequent determinations.

         None of the services provided by our independent auditors for fiscal
2003 was obtained in reliance on the waiver of the pre-approval requirement
afforded in SEC regulations.

                                   SIGNATURES

         Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities
