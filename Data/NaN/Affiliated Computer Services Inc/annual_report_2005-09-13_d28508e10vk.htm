</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are a Fortune 500 and S&#038;P 500 company with approximately 52,000 employees providing business
process and information technology outsourcing solutions to commercial and government clients. We
were incorporated in Delaware on June&nbsp;8, 1988 and are based in Dallas, Texas. Our clients have
time-critical, transaction-intensive business and information processing needs, and we typically
service these needs through long-term contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our services enable businesses and government agencies to focus on core operations, respond to
rapidly changing technologies and reduce expenses associated with business processes and
information processing. Our business strategy is to expand our client base and enhance our service
offerings through both marketing and acquisitions. Our marketing efforts focus on developing
long-term relationships with clients that choose to outsource mission critical business processes
and information technology requirements. Our business expansion has been accomplished both from
internal growth as well as through acquisitions. Since inception, our acquisition program has
resulted in growth and diversification of our client base, expansion of services and products
offered, increased economies of scale and geographic expansion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues for fiscal year 2005 totaled $4.4&nbsp;billion. We serve two primary markets, which include
commercial and government clients. We provide business process outsourcing, information technology
outsourcing, and systems integration services to our commercial sector clients. Our Commercial
segment accounted for approximately $2.2&nbsp;billion, or 50% of our fiscal year 2005 revenues. These
services are provided to a variety of clients worldwide, including healthcare providers and payors,
pharmaceutical and other manufacturers, retailers, wholesale distributors, utilities,
entertainment, higher education institutions, financial institutions, insurance and transportation
companies. Our business process outsourcing services include administration, human resources and
related consulting, finance and accounting, customer care, and payment services. Our information
technology outsourcing services include mainframe, midrange, desktop, network, consulting and
web-hosting solutions. Our systems integration services include application development and
implementation, applications outsourcing, technical support and training, as well as network design
and installation services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are a leading provider of business process outsourcing, information technology outsourcing and
systems integration services to state and local governments. During fiscal year 2005, revenues from
our Government segment accounted for approximately $2.2&nbsp;billion, or 50% of our revenues. We provide
technology-based services with a focus on transaction processing and program management services
such as Medicaid fiscal agent services, child support payment processing, electronic toll
collection, loan processing, welfare and community services, and traffic violations processing. We
also design, develop, implement, and operate large-scale health and human services programs and the

2005 consolidated revenues were derived from contracts with government clients. Our Government
segment includes our relationship with the Department of Education, for which we service Federal
student loans, including their Direct Student Loan program, and which represents approximately 5%
of our consolidated revenues. Our services help government agencies reduce operating costs,
increase revenue streams and increase the quality of services to citizens. Government clients may
terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause, for convenience or lack of funding.
Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government
agencies. If the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract, the costs are
not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government.

transactions processed, human services cases managed or, in instances where a systems development
project is required, for example, in government healthcare, we generally price our services on a
fixed fee basis for the development work.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We focus on four areas within our Transportation Solutions: Electronic Toll Collection, Motor
Vehicle Services, Commercial Vehicle Operations and Transportation related enforcement programs.
Within Electronic Toll Collection, we offer toll agencies an array of services including the
operation of the back-office customer service center as well as lane installation and integration.
We currently operate the E-Z Pass programs in New Jersey and New York, the largest electronic toll
collection programs in the world. Within Motor Vehicle Services, we assist states in the processing
of fuel tax and registration revenues. We process approximately 24% of state-issued operating
credentials and support the operations of more than 28% of the motor carriers operating in the
United States. Within Commercial Vehicle Operations, we offer a nationwide network that
electronically checks safety credentials and weighs trucks at highway speed, granting participating
truckers authorization to bypass open weigh stations and ports-of-entry without stopping.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We provide to cities and local municipalities technology-based services and solutions with a focus
on program management and transaction processing, including parking violation processing, emergency
medical services billing and collection programs, and red light photo and speed enforcement systems
and services. We currently process parking violations in 9 of the 15 largest U.S. cities who
outsource parking violation processing, representing 70% of outsourced ticket processing in these
cities. Those services support the entire timeline of a violation, from citation issuance to final
disposition, and include boot and tow programs, customer service, program management reviews, meter
installation, maintenance and collections. Our public safety commitment further extends to
emergency medical services billing and collections programs and red light photo and speed
enforcement services. We provide photo enforcement systems and/or services to 11 of the 15 largest
participating cities in North America.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Our largest contract is with the Department of Education. In November&nbsp;2003, the Department of
Education awarded us the Common Services for Borrowers contract, which includes comprehensive loan
servicing, consolidation loan processing, debt collection and portfolio management services. The
five-year base contract replaced our existing contract with the Department of Education and will
integrate a number of services, which will allow the Department of Education to increase service
quality while saving overall program costs. The contract is estimated at more than $1&nbsp;billion in
revenue over the five-year period and was effective January&nbsp;1, 2004. The contract also includes
provisions for five one-year extensions. Annual revenues from this relationship represent
approximately 5% of our fiscal year 2005 consolidated revenues.

and information technology services companies. We have a diverse client base. Within the
Commercial segment, we serve the major vertical markets that spend heavily on technology including
healthcare providers and payors, pharmaceutical and other manufacturers, retailers, wholesale
distributors, utilities, entertainment, higher education institutions, financial institutions,
insurance and transportation companies. Within the Government segment, our clients include a wide
variety of state governments, municipal governments and agencies and the U.S. Department of
Education. Clients may be lost due to merger, business failure, or conversion to a competing
processor or to an in-house system. Our business with government clients is subject to various
risks, including the reduction or modification of contracts due to changing government needs and
requirements. Government contracts, by their terms, generally can be terminated for convenience by
the government, which means that the government may terminate the contract at any time, without
cause.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our five largest clients accounted for approximately 15%, 14% and 13% of our fiscal years 2005,
2004 and 2003 revenues, respectively. Our largest client, the
Department of Education, represented
approximately 5%, 5% and 4% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Over 97% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 were derived from
domestic clients. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, approximately 93% and 94% of our long-lived assets,
respectively, were located in the United States. Of our long-lived assets located outside the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The markets for our services are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. We believe our
competitive advantage comes from our use of world-class technology, subject matter expertise,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We compete in the commercial market by offering value added business process outsourcing,
information technology outsourcing and system integration services. The competition for our
commercial outsourcing services is primarily the in-house departments performing the function we
are seeking to outsource, as well as Accenture, Computer Sciences Corp., Electronic Data Systems
Corporation (&#147;EDS&#148;), Hewitt, IBM, Perot Systems, and other providers. We may be required to
purchase technology assets from prospective clients or to provide financial assistance to
prospective clients in order to obtain their contracts. Many of our competitors have substantially
greater resources and thus, may have a greater ability to obtain client contracts where sizable
asset purchases, investments or financing support are required.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We compete in the government market by offering a broad range of business process outsourcing
services and information technology outsourcing services. Competition in the government market is
fragmented by line of services and we are a leading provider in most of the areas we serve.
Competition in the government market is primarily Accenture, Convergys, EDS, IBM, JP Morgan,
Maximus, Roper Industries, Tier Technologies, and Unisys Corp.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We expect to encounter additional competition as we address new markets and new competitors enter
our existing markets. If we are forced to lower our pricing or if demand for our services
decreases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow may be
materially and adversely affected. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources,
and they may be able to use their resources to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies,
to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services, or to obtain
client contracts where sizeable asset purchases, investments or financing support are required. In
addition, we must frequently compete with a client&#146;s own internal business process and information
technology capabilities, which may constitute a fixed cost for the client.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the future, competition could continue to emerge from large computer hardware or software
providers as they shift their business strategy to include services. Competition has also emerged
from European and Indian service providers seeking to expand into our markets and from large
consulting companies seeking operational outsourcing opportunities.

Approximately 1,700 of our international employees are represented by unions, primarily in Mexico.
Approximately 450 of our European employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
Employment arrangements for our international employees are often governed by works or labor

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">One of our subsidiaries, ACS Defense, LLC, and several other government contractors received a
grand jury document subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in
October&nbsp;2002. The subpoena was issued in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;). The inquiry concerns certain IDIQ
(Indefinite Delivery &#151; Indefinite Quantity) procurements and their related task orders, which
occurred in the late 1990s at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts. Our revenue from the
contracts that we believe to be the focus of the DOJ&#146;s inquiry was approximately $17.2&nbsp;million for
the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2004, representing approximately 0.4% of our revenue for fiscal year
2004. In February&nbsp;2004, we sold the contracts associated with the Hanscom Air Force Base
relationship to ManTech International Corporation (&#147;ManTech&#148;); however, we have agreed to indemnify ManTech
with respect to this DOJ investigation. The DOJ is continuing its investigation, but we have no
information as to when the DOJ will conclude this process. We have cooperated with the DOJ in
producing documents in response to the subpoena, and our internal investigation and review of this
matter through outside legal counsel will continue through the conclusion of the DOJ investigatory
process. We are unable to express an opinion as to the likely outcome of this matter at this time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Another of our subsidiaries, ACS State &#038; Local Solutions, Inc. (&#147;ACS SLS&#148;), and a teaming partner
of this subsidiary, Tier Technologies, Inc. (&#147;Tier&#148;), received a grand jury document subpoena
issued by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in May&nbsp;2003. The subpoena
was issued in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. We
believe that the inquiry concerns the teaming arrangements between ACS SLS and Tier on child
support payment processing contracts awarded to ACS SLS, and Tier as a subcontractor to ACS SLS, in
New York, Illinois and Ohio but may also extend to the conduct of ACS SLS and Tier with respect to
the bidding process for child support contracts in certain other states. Effective June&nbsp;30, 2004,
Tier was no longer a subcontractor to us in Ohio. Our revenue from the contracts for which Tier
was a subcontractor was approximately $43.5&nbsp;million, $67&nbsp;million and $40.6&nbsp;million in fiscal years
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing approximately 1%,
1.6% and 1.1% of our fiscal years
2005, 2004 and 2003 revenues, respectively. Our teaming arrangement with Tier also contemplated the
California child support payment processing request for proposals, which was issued in late 2003;
however, we did not enter into a teaming agreement with Tier for the California request for
proposals. Based on Tier&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we understand that
on November&nbsp;20, 2003 the DOJ granted conditional amnesty to Tier in connection with this inquiry
pursuant to the DOJ&#146;s Corporate Leniency Policy. The policy provides that the DOJ will not bring
any criminal charges against Tier as long as it continues to fully cooperate in the inquiry (and
makes restitution payments if it is determined that parties were injured as a result of
impermissible anticompetitive conduct). The DOJ is continuing its investigation, but we have no
information as to when the DOJ will conclude this process. We have cooperated with the DOJ in
producing documents in response to the subpoena, and our internal

our local staff. Our total revenue generated from the Florida workforce services amounts to
approximately 0.9%, 1% and 1.3% of our total fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 revenues,
respectively. In March&nbsp;2004, we filed our response to the OIG report. The principal workforce
policy organization for the State of Florida, which oversees and monitors the administration of the
State&#146;s workforce policy and the programs carried out by AWI and the regional workforce boards, is
Workforce Florida, Inc. (&#147;WFI&#148;). On May&nbsp;20, 2004, the Board of Directors of WFI held a public
meeting at which the Board announced that WFI did not see a systemic problem with our performance
of these workforce services and that it considered the issue closed. There were also certain
contract billing issues that arose during the course of our performance of our workforce contract
in Dade County, Florida, which ended in June&nbsp;2003. However, during the first quarter of fiscal
year 2005, we settled all financial issues with Dade County with respect to our workforce contract
with that county and the settlement is fully reflected in our results of operations for the first
quarter of fiscal year 2005. We were also advised in February&nbsp;2004 that the SEC had initiated an
informal investigation into the matters covered by the OIG&#146;s report, although we have not received
any request for information or documents since the middle of calendar year 2004. On March&nbsp;22,
2004, ACS SLS received a grand jury document subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida. The subpoena was issued in connection with an inquiry being
conducted by the DOJ and the Inspector General&#146;s Office of the U.S. Department of Labor (&#147;DOL&#148;)
into the subsidiary&#146;s workforce contracts in Dade and Monroe counties in Florida, which also
expired in June&nbsp;2003, and which were included in the OIG&#146;s report. On August&nbsp;11, 2005, the South
Florida Workforce Board notified us that all deficiencies in our Dade County workforce contract
have been appropriately addressed and all findings are considered resolved. On August&nbsp;25, 2004, ACS
SLS received a grand jury document subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court for the Middle
District of Florida in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the DOJ and the Inspector
General&#146;s Office of the DOL. The subpoena relates to a workforce contract in Pinellas County in
Florida for the period from January&nbsp;1999 to the contract&#146;s expiration in March&nbsp;2001, which was
prior to our acquisition of this business from Lockheed Martin Corporation in August&nbsp;2001.
Further, we settled a civil lawsuit with Pinellas County in December&nbsp;2003 with respect to claims
related to the services rendered to Pinellas County by Lockheed Martin Corporation prior to our
acquisition of ACS SLS (those claims having been transferred with ACS SLS as part of the
acquisition), and the settlement resulted in Pinellas County paying ACS SLS an additional $600,000.
We are continuing our internal investigation of these matters through outside legal counsel and
we are continuing to cooperate with the DOJ, the SEC and DOL to produce documents in connection
with their investigations. At this stage of these investigations, we are unable to express an
opinion as to their likely outcome. We anticipate that we may receive additional subpoenas for
information in other Florida Workforce regions as a result of the AWI report issued in January
2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2004, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (&#147;MDEQ&#148;) issued a Notice of
Violation to ACS Image Solutions, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, that alleged noncompliance with
the Clean Water Act and the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. On September&nbsp;20, 2004,
we agreed to settle this matter with the MDEQ for $150,000. We have closed the specific operation
whose activities resulted in this notice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;16, 1998, a state district court in Houston, Texas entered final judgment against us in
a lawsuit brought by 21 former employees of Gibraltar Savings Association and/or First Texas
Savings Association (collectively, &#147;GSA/FTSA&#148;). The GSA/FTSA employees alleged that they were
entitled to the value of 803,082 shares of our stock (adjusted for February&nbsp;2002 stock split)
pursuant to options issued to the GSA/FTSA employees in 1988 in connection with a former technology
outsourcing services agreement between GSA/FTSA and us. The judgment against us was for
approximately $17&nbsp;million, which included attorneys&#146; fees and pre-judgment interest. The judgment
was appealed by the plaintiffs and us and the appellate process has now been concluded. As a
result of the appeals, the trial court&#146;s judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the
trial court for further proceedings, except that the trial court judgment was affirmed in part as
to one of the plaintiffs and the trial court&#146;s dismissal of certain of our affirmative defenses was
upheld. The amount of the judgment for the one plaintiff whose judgment was upheld has been
settled for $1.3&nbsp;million. In August&nbsp;2004, mediation was conducted which resulted in the settlement
of claims of the other GSA/FTSA employees. As a result of this settlement, we accrued $10&nbsp;million
in other operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 related to this settlement
and paid $10&nbsp;million in full settlement of all claims of the other GSA/FTSA employees in August
2004.

to the exercise of options granted under our 1988 Stock Option Plan in excess of the amount
originally registered with the SEC on Form S-8 filed November&nbsp;17, 1994 (Registration No.&nbsp;33-86426).

    <TD>Under our 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as authorized by our shareholders pursuant to our
November&nbsp;14, 1997 Proxy Statement, the number of shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock
available for issuance is subject to increase by approval of our Board of Directors
pursuant to a formula that limits the number of shares optioned, sold, granted or otherwise
issued under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan to current employees, consultants and
non-employee directors to no more than 12.8% of our issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. Consequently, any share repurchases (as discussed below) reduce the number of
options to purchase shares that we may grant under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On February&nbsp;27, 2004, we completed the redemption of our 3.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
February&nbsp;15, 2006 (the &#147;Convertible Notes&#148;). Holders of 99.9% of all the outstanding Convertible
Notes converted their Convertible Notes to 23.0234 shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock per $1,000
principal amount of Convertible Notes in accordance with the procedures specified in the related
indenture governing the Convertible Notes. As the result of such conversions, approximately 7.3
million shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock were issued to such noteholders at the conversion price
of $43.44 per share. The remaining Convertible Notes were redeemed in cash at 101.4% of the
principal amount, resulting in a cash redemption of $269,000.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our Board of Directors has authorized two share repurchase programs totaling $1.25&nbsp;billion of our
Class&nbsp;A common stock. On September&nbsp;2, 2003, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a
share repurchase program of up to $500&nbsp;million of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and on April&nbsp;29, 2004,
we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new, incremental share repurchase program of
up to $750&nbsp;million of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. The programs, which are open-ended, will allow us
to repurchase our shares on the open market from time to time in accordance with SEC rules and
regulations, including shares that could be purchased pursuant to SEC Rule&nbsp;10b5-1. The number of
shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the level of cash and debt
balances, general business conditions and other factors, including alternative investment
opportunities. We intend to fund the repurchase programs from various sources, including, but not
limited to, cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under our existing revolving
Credit Facility. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, we had repurchased approximately 19.9&nbsp;million shares at a
total cost of approximately $994&nbsp;million and reissued 0.7&nbsp;million shares for proceeds totaling
$33.1&nbsp;million to fund contributions to our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan. We have
not repurchased any shares subsequent to June&nbsp;30, 2005.

Operations that are not based on historical fact are &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; within the

of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

expectations, the information on which such expectations were based may change. These
forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We derive our revenues from delivering comprehensive business process outsourcing and information
technology outsourcing solutions to commercial and government clients. A substantial portion of
our revenues is derived from recurring monthly charges to our clients under service contracts with
initial terms that vary from one to ten years. We define recurring revenues as revenues derived
from services that our clients use each year in connection with their ongoing businesses, and
accordingly, exclude software license fees, short-term contract programming and consulting
engagements, product installation fees, and hardware and software sales. However, as we add,
through acquisition or new service offerings, consulting or other services to enhance the value
delivered and offered to our clients which are primarily short-term in nature, we may experience
variations in our mix of recurring versus non-recurring revenues. Since inception, our acquisition
program has resulted in growth and diversification of our client base, expansion of services and
products offered, increased economies of scale and geographic expansion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>2006 Outlook</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a leading provider of both information technology and business process outsourcing services, we
believe we are well positioned to benefit from commercial and governmental entities&#146; demand to
outsource non-core, mission-critical back office functions. Demand for commercial business process
and information technology outsourcing services is expected to remain healthy during fiscal year
2006. Areas of strong demand in the Commercial segment include human resources outsourcing,
finance and accounting outsourcing, customer care and traditional IT outsourcing. We also
anticipate an improving demand environment for our government services. In addition to the areas
that we have marketed historically, such as government healthcare, municipal services and
transportation services and solutions, we also believe that government entities could benefit from

finance and accounting outsourcing. From a geographic perspective, we believe that there will
continue to be strong demand in the United States and expect to see more business process

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In order to capitalize on the opportunities in these markets, we will make certain investments and
reorganizations in our business. We recently completed strategic acquisitions in the human
resource outsourcing, customer care and commercial healthcare markets, which should allow us to
capitalize on strong demand in these vertical markets. We reorganized our Government segment during
fiscal year 2005 to better leverage our government client relationships, multiple service offerings
and subject matter experts. During fiscal year 2006, we expect to incur incremental expense of
approximately $20&nbsp;million as we expand our sales organization in the Government segment and Europe,
and are building data center capability in Eastern Europe.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Also during the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we announced that we had reached an agreement to
acquire a division of a Switzerland-based company which provides integrated solutions that automate
revenue collection in the areas of fare collection, airport parking and tolls. As discussed below
in Subsequent Events, we believe this acquisition will expand our portfolio in the transit and
parking payment markets and international transportation services industry.

Developments &#151; Fiscal Year 2005</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>New Business</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">During fiscal year 2005, we signed contracts with new clients and incremental business with
existing clients representing $700.2&nbsp;million of annualized recurring revenue and approximately $3.3
billion in estimated total contract value. The Commercial segment contributed 74% of the new
contract signings (based on annual recurring revenues), including contracts with Nextel Partners to
provide expanded customer care services and Chubb &#038; Sons Corporation to provide information
technology and human resource services. The Government segment contributed 26% of the new contract
signings (based on annual recurring revenues), including contracts with the State of Texas to
support the statewide roll-out of the Medicaid Primary Care Case Management, Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services for the Medicare-approved Transitional Assistance Card for Long Term Care
Residents, and New Jersey&#146;s Child Support Program to provide payment processing and debit card
services. There are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of new
business signings or total contract value. We define new business signings as recurring revenue
from new contracts, including the incremental portion of renewals, signed during the period and
represents the estimated first twelve months of revenue to be recorded under that contract after
full implementation. We use new business signings as a measure of estimated recurring revenues
represented by contractual commitments, both to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate
capital commitments. We define total contract value as the estimated total revenues from contracts
signed during the period and represents estimated total revenue over the term of the contract. We
use total contract value as an additional measure of estimating total revenue represented by
contractual commitments, both to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate capital commitments.
Revenues for both new business signings and total contract value are measured under GAAP.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Acquisitions</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">In May&nbsp;2005, we completed the acquisition of the human resources consulting and outsourcing
businesses of Mellon Financial Corporation (&#147;Mellon&#148;). The Acquired HR Business provides
consulting services, benefit plan administration services, and multi-scope HR outsourcing services.
The transaction was valued at approximately $405&nbsp;million, plus related transaction costs and was
funded from borrowings under our Credit Facility (as defined in &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148;).
The operating results of the acquired business are included in our financial statements in the
Commercial segment from the effective date of the acquisition, May&nbsp;1, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The integration of the Acquired HR Business is expected to occur primarily during the first three
quarters of fiscal year 2006. The integration includes the elimination of redundant facilities,
marketing and overhead costs, and the consolidation of processes from the historical cost structure
of the acquired Mellon organization. Such savings will begin to be realized beginning on the date
of the acquisition and continue to ramp during fiscal year 2006. During this period, we anticipate
spending $0.05 to $0.06 per diluted share related to integration activities for the Acquired HR
Business, primarily related to costs incurred to consolidate processes. In addition to the
anticipated costs that will be expensed in fiscal 2006, the liabilities recorded at closing for the
Acquired HR Business include $22.3&nbsp;million in involuntary employee termination costs for employees
of the Acquired HR Business in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3 &#147;Recognition of Liabilities in Connection
with a Purchase Business Combination.&#148; From the acquisition date through June&nbsp;30, 2005, $1.8
million in involuntary employee termination payments have been made and charged against this
liability. We anticipate that substantially all of this liability will be paid to involuntarily
terminated employees by the end of fiscal year 2006. As a result of this acquisition, included in
our fiscal year 2006 guidance was $0.04 to $0.06 cents per share of accretion related to this
acquisition, net of the integration costs discussed above.

offer, which was completed on January&nbsp;25, 2005, and subsequent short-form merger, at a purchase
price of $8.50 per share. Superior provides information technology consulting and business process
outsourcing services and solutions to the healthcare industry. The transaction was valued at
approximately $122.2&nbsp;million (including payment of approximately $106&nbsp;million for issued and
outstanding shares, options, and warrants and additional amounts for debentures and other payments)
plus related transaction costs and was funded from borrowings under our Credit Facility. The

messaging services. The transaction was valued at approximately $73.5&nbsp;million, plus related
transaction costs. The transaction value includes $6.4&nbsp;million attributable to the 9.2% minority
interest we held in BlueStar prior to the acquisition; therefore, the net purchase price was
approximately $67.1&nbsp;million. Of this amount, approximately $61&nbsp;million was paid to former BlueStar
shareholders by June&nbsp;30, 2005 and was funded from borrowings under our credit facilities and cash
on hand. The remaining purchase price of approximately $6&nbsp;million will be paid in the first quarter
of fiscal year 2006. The operating results of the acquired business are included in our financial

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2004, we acquired Heritage Information Systems, Inc. (&#147;Heritage&#148;). Heritage provides
clinical management and pharmacy cost containment solutions to 14 state Medicaid programs, over a
dozen national commercial insurers and Blue Cross Blue Shield licensees and some of the largest
employer groups in the country. The transaction was valued at approximately $23.1&nbsp;million plus
related transaction costs, excluding contingent consideration of up to $17&nbsp;million maximum based
upon future financial performance, and was funded from borrowings under our Prior Facility (as
defined in &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148;) and cash on

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">In April&nbsp;2004, we were awarded a contract by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human
Services (&#147;DHHS&#148;) to replace and operate the North Carolina Medicaid Management Information System
(&#147;NCMMIS&#148;). Prior to DHHS&#146; award of the contract, our proposal was reviewed and approved by the
State of North Carolina&#146;s Information Technology Services group and the Federal Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services. Two competitors protested the contract award. In considering the protests,
DHHS again reviewed our proposal and determined that our technical solutions did, in fact, comply
with all technical requirements and denied the protests on June&nbsp;3, 2004. EDS protested the denial.
On January&nbsp;12, 2005, an administrative law judge made a non-binding recommendation to sustain EDS&#146;
protest of the contract between us and the DHHS. Notwithstanding the reviews, approvals, and
decisions in awarding the contract and in considering the protests, the administrative law judge
based his recommendation on his assessment that our technical solution did not fully comply with
the DHHS technical standards for proposals. The non-binding recommendation was issued to the North
Carolina State Chief Information Officer (&#147;CIO&#148;), Office of Technology Services. We, DHHS and EDS
each presented written arguments to the CIO. A hearing was held before the CIO on March&nbsp;15, 2005
during which each of the parties presented oral arguments. On April&nbsp;28, 2005, the CIO issued a
decision in favor of the DHHS and us as to the issues of: (i)&nbsp;the sufficiency of our technical
solution, (ii)&nbsp;our satisfaction of RFP requirements relative to our integrated testing facility,
and (iii)&nbsp;whether the State&#146;s evaluation was consistent with the RFP&#146;s evaluation criteria.
However, his ruling also found insufficient evidence or argument had been submitted to address
three other issues raised by EDS in its initial protest filing. Therefore, the CIO has directed
that a hearing be conducted on the issues of whether (a)&nbsp;our proposal complied with RFP
requirements relative to experience of proposed key personnel; (b)&nbsp;our proposal complied with RFP
requirements for pricing; and (c)&nbsp;any perceived price advantage is illusory and in any event was
miscalculated by DHHS. EDS subsequently waived its right to a hearing before the CIO on these
three remaining issues and, on May&nbsp;18, 2005, EDS appealed the CIO&#146;s decision to Wake County
Superior Court. It is anticipated that a hearing will be held
in October&nbsp;2005. We intend to
vigorously pursue affirmation of DHHS&#146; contract award. DHHS has instructed us to continue
performance of our services under the contract.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"> in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. On July&nbsp;21, 2004, we entered into a definitive settlement
agreement with DCH to settle these disputes. The terms of the definitive settlement, which were
substantially the same as those announced in January&nbsp;2004, include the $10&nbsp;million payment by us to
DCH; a payment by DCH to us of $9&nbsp;million in system development costs; escrow of $11.8&nbsp;million paid
by DCH, with $2.4&nbsp;million of the escrowed funds to be paid to us upon completion of an agreed work
plan ticket and reprocessing of July&nbsp;2003 &#151; June&nbsp;2004 claims, and the remaining $9.4&nbsp;million of
escrowed funds to be paid to us upon final certification of the system by the Center for
Medicare/Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;), the governing Federal regulatory agency; cancellation of Phase
II of the contract; and an agreement to settle outstanding operational invoices resulting in a
payment to us of over $8.2&nbsp;million and approximately $7&nbsp;million of reduction in such invoices. In
April&nbsp;2005, CMS certified the system effective as of August&nbsp;1, 2003. DCH has requested funding
level information from CMS for the period from the system implementation date, April&nbsp;1, 2003,
through July&nbsp;31, 2003. We will begin discussions with DCH regarding distribution of the $9.4
million in escrow funds related to system certification when DCH receives the relevant information
from CMS. Our work related to the remaining $2.4&nbsp;million in escrow is continuing.

Savings Association and/or First Texas Savings Association, whereby we paid $10&nbsp;million in cash in
August&nbsp;2004 to settle in full their claims against us. We accrued the $10&nbsp;million related to this
settlement in other operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">During fiscal year 2003, we signed contracts with new clients and increased business with existing
clients representing $701&nbsp;million of annual recurring new revenue, which included $56.4&nbsp;million
related to the Divested Federal Business. The estimated total contract value of these contracts
excluding the Divested Federal Business was $3.4&nbsp;billion. The Commercial segment contributed 45%
of new business signings, including new contracts with Motorola to provide human resource
outsourcing services and Ingram Micro to manage their IT infrastructure. The Government segment
contributed 55% of new business signings, including new contracts with the Texas Health and Human
Services Commission to provide fiscal agent and administrative services and New Jersey E-ZPass to
provide electronic toll collection services.

segment. CyberRep provides customer care and customer relationship management services for the
telecommunications, wireless communications, technology, and consumer products industries. The
transaction was valued at approximately $42&nbsp;million, excluding contingent consideration of a
maximum of $3&nbsp;million based upon future financial performance, plus transaction costs. During
fiscal year 2004, we paid $3&nbsp;million of contingent consideration, which was earned during the year.
CyberRep&#146;s operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements from the
effective date of the acquisition, January&nbsp;1, 2003.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Internal revenue growth is measured as total revenue growth less acquired revenue from acquisitions
and revenues from divested operations. Acquired revenue from acquisitions is based on
pre-acquisition normalized revenue of acquired companies. We use the calculation of internal
revenue growth to measure revenue growth excluding the impact of acquired revenues and the revenue
associated with divested operations and we believe these adjustments to historical reported results
are necessary to accurately reflect our internal revenue growth. Prior period calculations are as
of the end of the reporting period presented and are not restated for subsequent acquisitions or
divestitures. The following table sets forth the calculation of internal revenue growth (in
thousands):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenues</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Revenue increased $244.8&nbsp;million, or 6%, to $4.4&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2005 from $4.1&nbsp;billion in
fiscal year 2004. Revenues related to the Divested Federal Business and the contracts sold to
ManTech (collectively the &#147;2004 Divestitures&#148;) were $0.6&nbsp;million and $258&nbsp;million for the year
ended June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Excluding the impact of the revenues related to the
2004 Divestitures, revenues increased $502.2&nbsp;million to $4.4&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2005 from $3.8
billion in fiscal year 2004, or 13%. Internal revenue growth, excluding the impact of the revenues
related to the 2004 Divestitures, for fiscal year 2005 was 4%. The remainder of the growth was
related to acquisitions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Internal revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was impacted by the following items: (1)&nbsp;the
termination of the Gateway and Roadway contracts in our Commercial segment, which accounted for
approximately $23.3&nbsp;million and $86.3&nbsp;million of revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The Gateway contract was effectively terminated during the first quarter of fiscal
year 2005 as a result of Gateway&#146;s acquisition of eMachines, Inc., which significantly changed its
business strategy. The Roadway contract was terminated at the end of fiscal year 2004 due to
Roadway&#146;s acquisition by Yellow Freight; and (2)&nbsp;HIPAA remediation work and our development work
on the Georgia Contract in our Government segment, which together accounted for approximately $3.3
million and $100&nbsp;million of revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue in our Commercial segment, which represented approximately half of our consolidated revenue
for fiscal year 2005, increased $496.7&nbsp;million, or 30%, to $2.2&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2005
compared to fiscal year 2004. Revenues related to the Divested Federal Business included in the
Commercial segment were $6.9&nbsp;million for fiscal year 2004. Excluding the impact of the revenues

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">related to the Divested Federal Business, revenues grew 30% in fiscal year 2005 compared to the
same period in fiscal year 2004. Revenue growth from acquisitions was 19% in fiscal year 2005.
Internal revenue growth, excluding the impact of the revenues related to the Divested Federal
Business, was 11%, due primarily to new business signings on contracts with Nextel, McDonald&#146;s,
Chubb &#038; Sons, Hallmark, Goodyear, University of Phoenix, General Electric, General Motors, Scotts
Company, Delta Airlines, Queens Medical Center and Northwest Airlines. These increases were
partially offset by the loss of the Roadway and Gateway contracts discussed above and decreased
revenues in our commercial unclaimed property business. The contracts discussed above collectively
represented approximately 80% of our internal revenue growth for the period in this segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue in our Government segment, which represented approximately half of our consolidated revenue
for fiscal year 2005, decreased $252&nbsp;million, or 10%, to $2.2&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2005 compared
to fiscal year 2004. Revenues related to the 2004 Divestitures included in the Government segment
were $0.6&nbsp;million and $251.1&nbsp;million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Excluding the
impact of the revenues related to the 2004 Divestitures, total Government segment fiscal year 2005
revenues were $2.2&nbsp;billion, which were flat compared to the prior year. Revenue growth from
acquisitions was 2% for fiscal year 2005. Internal revenue growth, excluding the impact of the
revenues related to the 2004 Divestitures, declined 2%, primarily due to decreases related to the
development work on the Georgia Contract and lower HIPAA related revenues discussed above and lower
revenues in our government unclaimed property and welfare businesses partially offset by increased
revenues on our Texas Medicaid, Department of Education, North Carolina Medicaid, Oklahoma City
public safety, New Jersey Department of Human Services, New Jersey E-ZPass, North Carolina seat
management, City of Memphis, Bay Area transit, New York payment processing and Georgia
e-disbursement contracts. The contracts discussed above collectively represented approximately 84%
of the net decline in our internal revenue growth for the period in this segment. Fiscal year 2004
revenue includes a $6.7&nbsp;million reduction resulting from the change in our percentage-of-completion
estimates on the Georgia Contract primarily as a result of the termination of Phase II of the
contract, which was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Wages and benefits increased $77.5&nbsp;million, or 4.3%, to $1.9&nbsp;billion. As a percentage of revenue,
wages and benefits decreased 0.7% to 42.9% in fiscal year 2005 from 43.6% in fiscal year 2004.
Included in wages and benefits for fiscal year 2004 are compensation costs associated with former
Federal employees of $9.8&nbsp;million, which were primarily stay bonuses and accelerated option vesting
due to the sale of the Divested Federal Business. Excluding these costs, wages and benefits
increased $87.3&nbsp;million, or 4.9%, in fiscal year 2005 (calculated as the $77.5&nbsp;million increase
plus $9.8&nbsp;million compensation costs, divided by reported wages and benefits costs for fiscal year
2004 less the $9.8&nbsp;million compensation costs) and therefore decreased 0.3% as a percentage of
revenue. The sale of the Divested Federal Business, the acquisition of Lockheed Martin
Corporation&#146;s commercial information technology outsourcing business and the new Common Services
for Borrowers contract with the Department of Education were responsible for approximately a 1.0%
decrease in wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue. The Divested Federal Business, which
provided primarily system integration services to the Federal Government and its agencies, had a
higher proportion of labor related expense to its revenues. The acquisition of Lockheed Martin
Corporation&#146;s commercial information technology outsourcing business has a lower proportion of
labor costs as a percentage of revenue than our existing operations. The new Common Services for
Borrowers contract also has a lower component of wages and benefits than our other operations due
to the use of subcontractors. This decrease was offset by an increase of approximately 0.6% as a
percentage of revenue as a result of the acquisition of the Acquired HR Business, which performs
human resource business process outsourcing services and consulting services and has a higher
component of wages and benefits related to its revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Services and supplies decreased $43.9&nbsp;million, or 4%, to $1&nbsp;billion. As a percentage of revenue,
services and supplies decreased 2.5% to 24% in fiscal year 2005 from 26.5% in fiscal year 2004.
Several factors contributed to the decrease as a percentage of revenue. Lower revenue in our
unclaimed property business contributed 1.1% of the decrease as a percentage of revenue and the
sale of the Divested Federal Business contributed 0.9% of the decrease as a percentage of revenue,
both of which had a higher component of services and supplies than our other ongoing operations;
and the $2.6&nbsp;million of wind-down costs related to the termination of Phase II of the Georgia
Contract recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 contributed 0.1%.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Rent, lease and maintenance increased $86.7&nbsp;million, or 20.8%, to $503.1&nbsp;million. As a percentage
of revenue, rent, lease and maintenance increased 1.5% to 11.6% in fiscal year 2005 from 10.1% in
fiscal year 2004. The impact of the sale of the Divested Federal Business in fiscal year 2004,
which primarily provided system integration services to its clients, contributed approximately 0.5%
of the increase as a percentage of revenue. These services typically have a lower component of
rent, lease and maintenance than information technology outsourcing services, which have higher
equipment costs. Approximately 0.3% of the increase as a percentage of revenue was due to growth

Federal Business, which had a lower component of depreciation and amortization expense as a
percentage of revenue than our ongoing operations due to lower equipment costs, contributed 0.3% of
the increase as a percentage of revenue. In addition, depreciation and amortization increased as a
percentage of revenue due to the acceleration of $2.3&nbsp;million intangible asset amortization related
to the Gateway contract termination. The remaining increase as a percentage of revenue is due to
the impact of capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets necessary to support our new
business and acquisitions.

as a result of higher interest expense resulting from an increase in the average balance
outstanding on our revolving credit facilities used to fund share repurchases and acquisitions, as
well as interest expense from the Senior Notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005.
This increase was partially offset by the impact of the redemption of our 3.5% Subordinated

in fiscal year 2004 and 2003, respectively. Excluding the impact of the revenues related to the
2004 Divestitures, revenues increased from $3.1&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2003 to $3.8&nbsp;billion in
fiscal year 2004, or 25%. Revenue in fiscal year 2004 includes a $6.7&nbsp;million reduction resulting
from the change in our percentage-of-completion estimates on the Georgia Contract primarily as a

$6.9&nbsp;million and $30.2&nbsp;million in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Excluding the impact of
the revenues related to the Divested Federal Business, revenues grew 38% in fiscal year 2004
compared to fiscal year 2003. Internal revenue growth, excluding the impact of the revenues
related to the Divested Federal Business, was 19% primarily due to the ramp up of new business
including, among others, the Motorola, General Motors, Gateway, Ingram Micro, Miller Brewing,
Northwest Airlines, and Trilegiant contracts. These contracts collectively represent 74% of the

Internal revenue growth, excluding the impact of the revenues related to the 2004 Divestitures, was
15%, due primarily to increased revenue in our Texas Medicaid, Department of Education, New Jersey

compensation costs of $9.8&nbsp;million associated with former Federal employees, which were primarily
stay bonuses and accelerated option vesting due to the Divested Federal Business. Excluding these

year 2003 (calculated as the $73.5&nbsp;million increase less $9.8&nbsp;million compensation costs, divided
by reported fiscal year 2003 wages and benefits costs) and therefore decreased to 43.3% as a
percentage of revenue. The sale of the Divested Federal Business and the acquisition of Lockheed
Martin Corporation&#146;s commercial information outsourcing business were primarily responsible for the
decrease in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. The Divested Federal Business, which provided
primarily system integration services to the Federal Government and its agencies, had a higher
proportion of labor related expenses to its revenues. In addition, the acquisition of Lockheed

result of the cessation of depreciation and amortization related to the assets held for sale in our
Divested Federal Business. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization increased
0.5%, to 4.5%, due to $258&nbsp;million of capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets,
offset by the sale of the Divested Federal Business, which had a lower percentage of depreciation

operating activities compared to the fiscal year 2004 amount of approximately $476.2&nbsp;million.
Fiscal year 2005 cash flows provided by operating activities includes a temporary benefit of $75.9
million arising from Mellon Financial Corporation (&#147;Mellon&#148;) funding certain operating expenses of
the Acquired HR Business that were not reimbursed to Mellon until July&nbsp;2005 per the terms of a
Transition Services Agreement. Mellon is providing certain accounting, treasury and payroll
services for an interim period. As part of these services, Mellon is also paying certain
operational costs on our behalf, such as employee related expenses and accounts payable. This
agreement and the related timing of payments to Mellon had a
favorable impact on our cash flows provided by operating
activities for
fiscal year 2005 and will continue to impact our cash flows provided by operating
activities until the third quarter of fiscal year
2006 upon full integration of the Acquired HR Business employees and related accounting systems.
Fiscal year 2005 cash flows provided by operating activities were negatively impacted by the
payment of approximately $19.3&nbsp;million related to the settlement of the interest rate hedges
associated with the issuance of the Senior Notes (see Derivatives below). Excluding these items in
fiscal year 2005, cash flows provided by operating activities was $682.7&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Fiscal year 2004 cash flows provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by a tax
payment of approximately $88.1&nbsp;million related to the gain from the sale of the Divested Federal
Business (gross proceeds from the sale of the Divested Federal Business are reflected in cash flows
provided by investing activities, but the tax payment related to the sale is presented as a
reduction in cash flows provided by operating activities). Excluding this tax payment in fiscal
year 2004, cash flows provided by operating activities was $564.3&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Excluding the items discussed above, the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in
fiscal year 2005 was primarily a result of increased net income and increased collections on our
accounts receivable balances. In fiscal year 2004, cash flows provided by operating activities
were adversely impacted by increased receivables related to development work on our Georgia
contract, which was substantially completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004. We collected
billed amounts outstanding related to this development work in fiscal year 2005. The fiscal year
2005 improvement in net income (excluding the fiscal year 2004 Gain on Sale of Business) and
accounts receivables was partially offset by increased payments on our accrued liability balances,
including the payment of a prior year legal settlement of $10&nbsp;million (see Significant Developments
&#151; Fiscal Year 2004) and the payment of the settlement on the Georgia Contract of $10&nbsp;million (see
Significant Developments &#151; Fiscal Year 2004), as well as the timing of payments related to software
used in our information technology outsourcing business, transfer agent fees related to our
unclaimed property business and other contract related costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounts receivable fluctuations may have a significant
impact on our cash flows provided by
operating activities. The payments received from clients on our billed accounts receivables and the
increase in such accounts receivable are reflected as a single component of our cash flows provided
by operating activities, and the timing of collections of these receivables may have either a
positive or negative impact on our liquidity.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed and defined in &#147;New Accounting Pronouncements&#148; below, we will adopt SFAS 123(R) July
1, 2005. Under SFAS 123(R), the excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options which was

Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;00-15 &#147;Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit
Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option&#148; will be reported in

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal year 2005, 2004 and 2003, cash provided by (used in) investing activities was ($922
million), $70.4&nbsp;million and ($320.1&nbsp;million), respectively. We used $626.9&nbsp;million for acquisitions
during fiscal year 2005, primarily for the purchase of the Acquired HR Business, Superior and
BlueStar. Fiscal year 2004 includes proceeds from the 2004 Divestitures of $583.1&nbsp;million as well
as payments for acquisitions during the period of $251.7&nbsp;million, including the acquisition of
Lockheed Martin&#146;s commercial information technology business, PASC and TMI. Fiscal year 2003
includes $76.8&nbsp;million of payments for acquisitions, including the acquisition of CyberRep. Cash
used for the purchase of property, equipment and software and additions to other intangible assets
was $288.7&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2005, $258&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2004 and $253.6&nbsp;million in
fiscal year 2003.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal year 2005, approximately $168.4&nbsp;million was provided by financing activities. Such
financing activities included $496.1&nbsp;million net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes,
offset by repurchases of approximately 4.9&nbsp;million shares of our common stock pursuant to our share
repurchase programs for approximately $250.8&nbsp;million and net repayments of debt primarily under our
credit facilities of $143.7&nbsp;million. Fiscal year 2004 cash used in financing activities included
the repurchase of approximately 15&nbsp;million shares of our common stock pursuant to our share
repurchase programs, offset by net borrowings primarily under our Prior Credit Facility (defined
below) of $185.4&nbsp;million, primarily to fund our share repurchase programs. Fiscal year 2003 cash
used in financing activities was primarily related to the paydown of debt.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Senior Notes</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">On June&nbsp;6, 2005, we completed a public offering of $250&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of 4.70%
 Senior Notes due June&nbsp;1, 2010 and $250&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of 5.20%
 Senior Notes due June&nbsp;1, 2015. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semiannually.
The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $496&nbsp;million, after deducting underwriting
discounts, commissions and expenses, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of our
Credit Facility (defined below), part of which was incurred in connection with the acquisition of
the Acquired HR Business. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time prior to
maturity, which may include prepayment penalties determined according to pre-established criteria.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Senior Notes contain customary covenants
 including, but not limited to, restrictions on our
ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to create or incur secured indebtedness, merge or
consolidate with another person, or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the principal of, and all accrued and unpaid
interest on, the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable by the trustee, The Bank of New York
Trust Company, N.A., or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Notes. Such events of default include, but are not limited to, payment default, covenant defaults,
material payment defaults (other than under the Senior Notes) and voluntary or involuntary
bankruptcy proceedings. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, we were in compliance with the covenants of our
Senior Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Credit Facilities</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">On October&nbsp;27, 2004, we entered into a Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent (&#147;JP Morgan&#148;), and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as Syndication Agent, and a syndication of 19 other lenders (the &#147;Credit
Facility&#148;). Proceeds from advances under the Credit Facility were used for general corporate
purposes, to fund acquisitions and for repurchases under our share repurchase programs. The Credit
Facility provides for an unsecured $1.5&nbsp;billion multi-currency revolving credit and competitive
advance facility (fully available in U.S. dollars, Euros or competitive loans in any currency).
Multi-currency commitments (available in certain specified currencies
other than U.S. dollars or
Euros) in an initial aggregate amount of $200&nbsp;million and swing line loans in an amount up to $150
million are provided under the facility. Subject to affirmation of representations and warranties,
status of no default and commitments by willing lenders, the Credit Facility may be increased by up
to an additional $300&nbsp;million. The lending commitments under the Credit Facility are scheduled to
terminate October&nbsp;27, 2009. The terms and rates of the Credit Facility are generally more favorable
than those of the Prior Facility (defined below). At the closing of the Credit Facility, we
borrowed $316&nbsp;million under the Credit Facility to pay off and terminate the Prior Facility. In
addition, $94&nbsp;million in letters of credit were issued at closing under the Credit Facility to
replace letters of credit outstanding under the Prior Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other than competitive loans and swing line loans, advances under the Credit Facility bear interest
at a Base Rate (generally equal to the prime rate of JP Morgan) or a Eurocurrency rate plus a
percentage (ranging from 0.220% to 0.775%, currently 0.39%) determined based on our credit rating.
We are required to pay accrued interest at established intervals based upon our elected interest
period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Among other fees, we pay a facility fee of 0.110% per annum (due quarterly), based on our credit
rating on the aggregate commitment of the Credit Facility, whether used or unused. We also pay a
utilization fee of 0.125% on the total amount outstanding under the Credit Facility for each day
that such amount exceeds 50% of the aggregate commitments then in effect.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Credit Facility contains customary covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on our
ability, and in certain instances, our subsidiaries&#146; ability, to incur liens, merge or dissolve,
finance accounts receivables, or sell or transfer assets. The Credit Facility also limits our
ability to incur additional indebtedness at the subsidiary level. In addition, we may not permit
our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 2.75 to 1.0 or our consolidated interest coverage ratio
to be less than 3.50 to 1.0.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the Credit Facility may be
accelerated and the lending commitments under the Credit Facility terminated. Such events of
default include, but are not limited to, payment default to lenders, material inaccuracies of
representations and warranties, covenant defaults, material payment defaults (other than under the
Credit Facility), voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material money judgments,
material ERISA events, or change of control. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, we were in compliance with the
covenants of our Credit Facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Simultaneously with entering into the $1.5&nbsp;billion Credit Facility, we terminated our then existing
$875&nbsp;million revolving credit facility (the &#147;Prior Facility&#148;) on October&nbsp;27, 2004 and repaid the
$316&nbsp;million outstanding on the Prior Facility with borrowings under the Credit Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Draws made under our credit facilities are made to fund cash acquisitions, share repurchases and
for general working capital requirements. During fiscal year 2005, the balance outstanding under
our credit facilities for borrowings ranged from $233.9&nbsp;million to $798.3&nbsp;million. At June&nbsp;30,
2005, we had approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion available on our Credit Facility after giving effect to
outstanding indebtedness and $100.9&nbsp;million of outstanding letters of credit that secure certain
contractual performance and other obligations and which reduce the availability of our Credit
Facility. At June&nbsp;30, 2005, we had $0.2&nbsp;billion outstanding on our Credit Facility, which is
reflected in long-term debt, and of which substantially all bore interest from 3.61% to 3.72%.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other credit arrangements</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Certain contracts, primarily in our Government segment, require us to provide a surety bond or a
letter of credit as a guarantee of performance. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, $269.2&nbsp;million of outstanding
surety bonds and $84.9&nbsp;million of our outstanding letters of credit secure our performance of
contractual obligations with our clients. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of
these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations under each contract,
the probability of which we believe is remote. In addition, we had approximately $16&nbsp;million of
letters of credit which secure our casualty insurance and certain vendor programs. We believe that
we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity from our cash flow and Credit
Facility to respond to future requests for proposals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We believe that available cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations
and available borrowings under our Credit Facility, will provide adequate funds for our anticipated
internal growth and operating needs, including capital expenditures, and to meet the cash
requirements of our contractual obligations below. In addition, we intend to continue our growth
through acquisitions, which could require significant commitments of capital. In order to pursue
such opportunities we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive
securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to our future acquisitions and expansion
opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Derivatives</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">In order to hedge the variability of future interest payments related to our Senior Notes resulting
from changing interest rates, we entered into forward interest rate agreements in April&nbsp;2005. The
agreements were designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments in anticipation of
the issuance of our Senior Notes. The notional amount of the agreements totaled $500&nbsp;million and
the agreements were terminated in June&nbsp;2005 upon issuance of the Senior Notes. The settlement of
the forward interest rate agreements of $19&nbsp;million ($12&nbsp;million, net of income tax expense) is
reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as an increase in
reported interest expense over the term of the Senior Notes, with approximately $2.5&nbsp;million
amortized over the next 12&nbsp;months. During fiscal year 2005, we amortized approximately $0.2
million to interest expense. The amount of gain or loss related to hedge ineffectiveness was not
material.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Share Repurchase Programs</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Our Board of Directors has authorized two share repurchase programs totaling $1.25&nbsp;billion of our
Class&nbsp;A common stock. On September&nbsp;2, 2003, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a
share repurchase program of up to $500&nbsp;million of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and on April&nbsp;29, 2004,
we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new, incremental share repurchase program of
up to $750&nbsp;million of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. The programs, which are open-ended, will allow us
to repurchase our shares on the open market from time to time in accordance with SEC rules and
regulations, including shares that could be purchased pursuant to SEC Rule&nbsp;10b5-1. The number of
shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the level of cash and debt
balances, general business conditions and other factors, including alternative investment
opportunities. We intend to fund the repurchase programs from various sources, including, but not
limited to, cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under our existing revolving
Credit Facility. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, we had repurchased approximately 19.9&nbsp;million shares at a
total cost of approximately $994&nbsp;million and reissued 0.7&nbsp;million shares for proceeds totaling
$33.1&nbsp;million to fund contributions to our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan. We have
not repurchased any shares subsequent to June&nbsp;30, 2005.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">On February&nbsp;27, 2004, we completed the redemption of our 3.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
February&nbsp;15, 2006 (the &#147;Convertible Notes&#148;). Holders of 99.9% of all the outstanding Convertible

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">specified in the related indenture governing the Convertible Notes. As the result of such
conversions, approximately 7.3&nbsp;million shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock were issued to such
noteholders at the conversion price of $43.44 per share. The remaining Convertible Notes were
redeemed in cash at 101.4% of the principal amount, resulting in a cash redemption of $269,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Other</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">At June&nbsp;30, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents of $62.7&nbsp;million compared to $76.9&nbsp;million at
June&nbsp;30, 2004. Our working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) decreased
$0.9&nbsp;million to $406&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2005 from $406.9&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2004. Our current
ratio (defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities) was 1.5 and 1.6 at
June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio (defined as the sum of
short-term and long-term debt divided by the sum of short-term and long-term debt and equity) was
21% and 12.6% at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In order to conform our stock option program with standard market practice, on February&nbsp;2, 2005,
our Board of Directors approved an amendment to stock options previously granted that did not
become exercisable until five years from the date of grant to provide that such options become
exercisable on the day they vest. Options granted under both our 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and our
1988 Stock Option Plan generally vest in varying increments over a five year period. It is
expected that future option grants will contain matching vesting and exercise schedules. This
amendment does not amend or affect the vesting schedule, exercise price, quantity of options
granted, shares into which such options are exercisable or life of any award under any outstanding
option grant. Therefore, no compensation expense was recorded.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Related Party Transactions</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to July&nbsp;2002, we held a minority preferred stock interest in DDH Aviation, Inc., a corporate
airplane brokerage company organized in 1997 (as may have been reorganized subsequent to July&nbsp;2002,
herein referred to as &#147;DDH&#148;). Our Chairman owns a majority voting interest in DDH and our
President and General Counsel, along with our Chairman, were directors of DDH. At June&nbsp;30, 2002,
DDH had a $48&nbsp;million line of credit with Citicorp USA, Inc.
(&#147;Citicorp&#148;), for which we and our Chairman, in
exchange for warrants to acquire additional voting stock, acted as partial guarantors. In
addition, we obtained access to corporate aircraft at favorable rates in consideration of our
guaranty. We had guaranteed up to approximately $11.5&nbsp;million of the line of credit and our
Chairman guaranteed up to approximately $17.5&nbsp;million of the line of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2002, our Chairman assumed in full our guaranty obligations to Citicorp and Citicorp
released in full our guaranty obligations. Our minority preferred stock interest and warrants
(with a recorded value of $100,000 at June&nbsp;30, 2002) in DDH were cancelled. We have no further
ownership interest in DDH. Our officers, other than the Chairman, are no longer directors of DDH.
As partial consideration for the release of our corporate guaranty, we entered into an agreement to
provide certain administrative services to DDH at no charge until such time as DDH meets certain
specified financial criteria. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, we purchased $1&nbsp;million in
prepaid charter flights at favorable rates from DDH. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, we had $0.6
million and $0.7&nbsp;million, respectively, remaining in prepaid flights with DDH. During fiscal year
2003, we paid DDH approximately $0.5&nbsp;million for maintenance services, chartered aircraft and
equipment. We made no payments to DDH during fiscal years 2005 and 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, we purchased approximately $9.0&nbsp;million, $6.4&nbsp;million and
$6.8&nbsp;million, respectively, of office products and printing services from Prestige Business
Solutions, Inc., a supplier owned by our Chairman&#146;s daughter-in-law. These products and services
were purchased on a competitive bid basis in substantially all cases. We believe this relationship
has allowed us to obtain these products and services at quality levels and costs more favorable
than would have been available through alternative market sources.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have entered into various contractual agreements to purchase telecom services. These agreements
provide for minimum annual spending commitments, and have varying terms through fiscal year 2009,
and are included in purchase obligations in the table above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We expect to contribute between $3.5&nbsp;million and $4.4&nbsp;million to our pension plans in fiscal year
2006. Minimum pension funding requirements are not included in the table above as such amounts are
zero for our pension plans as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. See Critical Accounting Policies and Note 13 of
our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our pension plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed above, certain contracts, primarily in our Government segment, require us to provide a
surety bond or a letter of credit as a guarantee of performance. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, outstanding
surety bonds of $269.2&nbsp;million and $84.9&nbsp;million of our outstanding letters of credit secure our
performance of contractual obligations with our clients. Approximately $16&nbsp;million of letters of
credit secure our casualty insurance and vendor programs. In general, we would only be liable for
the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance of our obligations under
each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are obligated to make certain contingent payments to former shareholders of acquired entities
upon satisfaction of certain contractual criteria in conjunction with certain acquisitions. During
fiscal year 2005, 2004 and 2003, we paid $17&nbsp;million, $10.4&nbsp;million and $8&nbsp;million, respectively,
related to acquisitions completed in prior years. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, the maximum aggregate
amount of the outstanding contingent obligations to former shareholders of acquired entities is
approximately $45.5&nbsp;million, of which $6.3&nbsp;million was earned during fiscal year 2005. The $6.3
million has been accrued as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and is expected to be paid during the first quarter of
fiscal year 2006. Upon satisfaction of the specified contractual criteria, any such payment would
result primarily in a corresponding increase in goodwill.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have indemnified Lockheed Martin Corporation against certain specified claims from certain
pre-sale litigation, investigations, government audits and other issues related to the Divested
Federal Business. Our contractual maximum exposure under these indemnifications is $85&nbsp;million;
however, we believe the actual exposure to be significantly less. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, other
accrued liabilities include a reserve for these claims in an amount we believe to be adequate at
this time. As discussed in Item&nbsp;3. Legal Proceedings, we have agreed to indemnify ManTech
International Corporation with respect to the DOJ investigation related to purchasing activities at
Hanscom during the period 1998-2000.

investors under outsourcing arrangements and do not acquire any servicing rights that are
transferable by us to a third party. At June&nbsp;30, 2005, we serviced a FFEL portfolio of
approximately 1.6&nbsp;million loans with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $21.2
billion. Some servicing agreements contain provisions that, under certain circumstances, require
us to purchase the loans from the investor if the loan guaranty has been permanently terminated as
a result of a loan default caused by our servicing error. If defaults caused by us are cured
during an initial period, any obligation we may have to purchase these loans expires. Loans that
we purchase may be subsequently cured, the guaranty reinstated and then we repackage the loans for
sale to third parties. We evaluate our exposure under our purchase obligations on defaulted loans
and establish a reserve for potential losses, or default liability reserve, through a charge to the
provision for loss on defaulted loans purchased. The reserve is evaluated periodically and adjusted
based upon management&#146;s analysis of the historical performance of the defaulted loans. As of June
30, 2005 and 2004, other accrued liabilities include reserves which we believe to be adequate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions or conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and
uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and
conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements involve significant judgments and estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue recognition</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">A significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that does not
require significant estimates or uncertainties. For example, transaction volumes and time and
costs under time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific, objective
criteria under the contracts. Accordingly, revenues recognized under these methods do not require
the use of significant estimates that are susceptible to change. Revenue recognized using the
percentage-of-completion accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as
discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our policy follows the guidance from SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148; (&#147;SAB
104&#148;). SAB 104 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in
financial statements and updates Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13 to be consistent with Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;00-21, &#147;Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables&#148; (&#147;EITF
00-21&#148;). We recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services
have been provided to the client, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
reasonably assured.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal year 2005, approximately 73% of our revenue was recognized based on transaction
volumes, approximately 14% was fixed fee based, wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our
performance obligations under the arrangement, approximately 8% was related to cost reimbursable
contracts, approximately 3% of our revenue was recognized using percentage-of-completion accounting
and the remainder is related to time and material contracts. Our revenue mix is subject to change
due to the impact of acquisitions and new business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as
incurred, such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience. Revenues on
unit-price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and
accepted by the client. Revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual
rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues for business process outsourcing services are recognized as services are rendered,
generally on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed. Information technology
processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client, generally at the
contractual selling prices of resources consumed or capacity utilized by our clients. Revenues from
annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period.
Revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties
regarding customer acceptance have expired.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system
development and implementation services are recognized over the contract term based on the
percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared
with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire
contract using Statement of Position 81-1, &#147;Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts&#148; (&#147;SOP 81-1&#148;). SOP 81-1 requires the use of
percentage-of-completion accounting for long-term contracts that are binding agreements between us
and our customers in which we agree, for compensation, to perform a service to the customer&#146;s
specifications. These services require that we perform significant, extensive and complex design,
development, modification and implementation activities for our customers&#146; systems. Performance
will often extend over long periods, and our right to receive future payment depends on our future
performance in accordance with the agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The percentage-of-completion methodology involves recognizing revenue using the percentage of
services completed, on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis, using a reasonably consistent
profit margin over the period. Due to the longer term nature of these projects, developing the
estimates of costs often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in
estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not
limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work
to be performed, and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity
or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and
revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such
revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision
become known.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">EITF 00-21 addresses the accounting treatment for an arrangement to provide the delivery or
performance of multiple products and/or services where the delivery of a product or system or
performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time.
The Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus regarding, among other issues, the applicability
of the provisions regarding separation of contract elements in EITF 00-21 to contracts where one or
more elements fall within the scope of other authoritative literature, such as SOP 81-1. EITF 00-21
does not impact the use of SOP 81-1 for contract elements that fall within the scope of SOP 81-1,
such as the implementation or development of an information technology system to client
specifications under a long-term contract. Where an implementation or development project is
contracted with a client, and we will also provide services or operate the system over a period of

Standards No.&nbsp;5, &#147;Accounting for Contingencies&#148; (&#147;SFAS 5&#148;). SFAS 5 requires that we record an
estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our
financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability
has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment. We
consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts
and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our contracts with clients typically span several years. We continuously review and reassess our
estimates of contract profitability. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a
loss accrual is recorded in the consolidated financial statements in the period it is first

inducements to customers in the form of various arrangements, including contractual credits, which
are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. The
determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and
assumptions about future business trends and growth. We continually evaluate whether events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of goodwill or intangible assets may not be
recoverable. In evaluating impairment, we estimate the sum of expected future cash flows derived
from the goodwill or intangible asset. Such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and
assumptions of future revenues, costs and expenses and other factors. If an event occurs which
would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill
or other intangible assets, such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a
material impact on our financial results.

plans for the Acquired HR Business employees located in Canada and the United Kingdom (&#147;UK&#148;). The
Canadian Acquired HR Business has both a funded basic pension plan and an unfunded excess pension
plan. The UK pension scheme is a funded plan. These defined benefit plans provide benefits for
participating employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period
before retirement. We have established June&nbsp;30 as our measurement date for these defined benefit
plans. The net periodic benefit costs for these plans are included in wages and benefits in our
consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition, May&nbsp;1, 2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The measurement of the pension benefit obligation of the plans at the acquisition date was
accounted for using the business combination provisions in SFAS 87, therefore, all previously

principally invested in developed markets, 17.5% bonds issued by UK corporates, 17.5% in UK
Treasury inflation-linked bonds and 10% in UK commercial property. External investment managers
actively manage all of the asset classes. The target asset allocation has been set by the plan&#146;s
trustee board with a view to meeting the long-term return assumed for setting the employer&#146;s
contributions while also reducing volatility relative to the plan&#146;s liabilities. The managers
engaged by the trustees manage their assets with a view to seeking moderate out-performance of

investment manager actively manages all of the asset classes. This manager uses an equal blend of
large cap value and large cap growth for stocks in order to participate in the returns generated by
stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. The bonds are managed using a
core approach where multiple strategies are engaged such as interest rate anticipation, credit
selection and yield curve positioning to mitigate overall risk. At this time, the manager does not
engage in any alternative investment strategies.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), &#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; (&#147;SFAS 123(R)&#148;). SFAS 123(R)
requires companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value
method and recognize compensation cost in its financial statements. SFAS 123(R) is effective
beginning as of the first annual reporting period beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005. We will adopt
SFAS 123(R) beginning July&nbsp;1, 2005 for new awards of stock-based compensation granted after that
date and for unvested awards outstanding at that date. We believe the impact of SFAS 123(R) on our
results of operations will be consistent with our historical disclosures of pro forma stock
compensation information under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 &#147;Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation&#148;; however, the excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options
which was historically classified as net cash provided by operating activities pursuant to the
provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;00-15 &#147;Classification in the Statement of Cash
Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee
Stock Option&#148; will be reported in net cash provided by financing activities after the
implementation of SFAS 123(R).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon implementation of SFAS 123(R), we will begin expensing share based payment arrangements using
the modified prospective method. Prior to fiscal year 2006, we followed Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148; (&#147;APB 25&#148;), in accounting for
share-based payment arrangements. Under APB 25, no compensation expense was recognized since the
exercise prices of the awards under our plans were at the current market price of our stock on the
date of grant. The total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized at June
30, 2005 was approximately $112.5&nbsp;million. This is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average of 3.5&nbsp;years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On
March&nbsp;29, 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107, &#147;Share-Based
Payment&#148; (&#147;SAB 107&#148;). SAB 107 provides guidance related to specific topics affected by SFAS 123(R), including
share-based payment transactions with non-employees, valuation methods, accounting for certain
redeemable financial instruments issued under share-based payment arrangements, the classification
of compensation expense, non-GAAP financial measures, capitalization of compensation cost related
to share-based payment arrangements, the accounting for income tax effects of share-based payment
arrangements upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the modification of employee share options prior to the
adoption of SFAS 123(R) and disclosures in Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations required after implementation of SFAS 123(R). We do not
believe SAB 107 will have a material impact on our implementation of SFAS 123(R).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;22, 2004, the President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the
&#147;Act&#148;). The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. FASB Staff Position 109-2 &#147;Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for
the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004&#148; allows
companies additional time beyond that provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109 &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes&#148; to determine the impact of the Act on its financial statements
and provides guidance for the disclosure of the impact of the Act on the financial statements. At
June&nbsp;30, 2005, cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries for which U.S. taxes have
not been recorded totaled $36.5&nbsp;million, the tax effects on which, if repatriated, cannot be
reasonably estimated at this time. We are currently considering repatriation of amounts up to and
including $36.5&nbsp;million, pending completion of our analysis. This incentive is available to us
until June&nbsp;30, 2006. The 85% dividends received deduction is subject to a number of limitations,
and we have not yet decided whether, or to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that
have not yet been remitted to the U.S. We will continue to monitor our international activities
and expect to reach a decision regarding repatriation prior to the expiration of this incentive.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Loss of, or reduction of business from, significant clients</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Our revenues, profitability and cash flow could be materially adversely affected by the loss of
significant clients and/or the reduction of volumes and services provided to our significant
clients as a result of, among other things, their merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or
businesses, contract expiration or non-renewal, or business failure or deterioration. In addition,
we incur fixed costs related to our information technology outsourcing and business process
outsourcing clients. Therefore the loss of any one of our significant clients could leave us with a
significantly higher level of fixed costs than is necessary to serve our remaining clients, thereby
reducing our profitability and cash flow.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Impairment of investments made to attract clients</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">In order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts we sometimes make significant capital
investments to perform the agreement, such as purchases of information technology equipment and
costs incurred to develop and implement software. The net book value of such assets recorded,
including a portion of our intangible assets, could be impaired, and our earnings and cash flow
could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of
such a contract or the reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as, among
other things, the client&#146;s merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or businesses, business
failure or deterioration, or a client&#146;s exercise of contract termination rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Competition</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We expect to encounter additional competition as we address new markets and new competitors enter
our existing markets. If we are forced to lower our pricing or if demand for our services
decreases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow may be
materially and adversely affected. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources,
and they may be able to use their resources to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies,
to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services, or to obtain
client contracts where sizable asset purchases, investments or financing support are required. In
addition, we must frequently compete with a client&#146;s own internal business process and information
technology capabilities, which may constitute a fixed cost for the client.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the future, competition could continue to emerge from large computer hardware or software
providers as they shift their business strategy to include services. Competition has also emerged
from European and Indian offshore service providers seeking to expand into our markets and from
large consulting companies seeking operational outsourcing opportunities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We intend to continue to expand our business through the acquisition of complementary companies.
We cannot, however, make any assurances that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition
candidates or consummate any additional acquisitions or that any future acquisitions will be
successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us. Without additional acquisitions, we are
unlikely to maintain historical total growth rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Failure to properly manage our operations and our growth</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We have rapidly expanded our operations in recent years. We intend to continue expansion in the
foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities. This rapid growth places
a significant demand on our management and operational resources. In order to manage growth
effectively, we must implement and improve our operational systems, procedures, and controls on a
timely basis. If we fail to implement these systems, procedures and controls on a timely basis, we
may not be able to service our clients&#146; needs, hire and retain new employees, pursue new business,
complete future acquisitions or operate our businesses effectively. We could also trigger
contractual credits to clients. Failure to properly transition new clients to our systems, properly
budget transition costs or accurately estimate new contract operational costs could result in
delays in our contract performance, trigger service level penalties or result in contracts whose
profit margins did not meet our expectations or our historical profit margins. Failure to
properly integrate acquired operations could result in increased cost. As a result of any of these
problems associated with expansion, our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Government clients &#151; termination rights, audits and investigations</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Approximately half of our revenues are derived from contracts with state and local governments and
from a contract with the Department of Education. Governments and their agencies may terminate most
of these contracts at any time, without cause. Also, our Department of Education contract is
subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the United States Congress to fund the
expenditures to be made by the Federal government under this contract. Additionally, government
contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies. If the
government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable
or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government. If the government

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, the contractor may be
subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include
termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or
debarment from doing business with the government. Any resulting penalties or sanctions could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flow. Further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits, investigations or
the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry
and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Government clients &#151; protests of contract awards</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">After an award of a government contract, a competing bidder may protest the award. If we are
awarded the contract and it is protested, it will be necessary to incur costs to defend the award
of the contract, which costs may be significant and could include hiring experts to defend the
basis for the contract award. Some contract protests may take years to resolve. In some instances
where we are awarded a contract, the contracting government entity may request that we sign a
contract and commence services, even though the contract award has been protested. If the protest
is upheld, then our contract would be terminated and the amounts due to us for services that have
been performed to date would be subject to payment pursuant to the terms of the terminated
contract. Such terms may not provide for full recovery of our incurred costs. In addition, if the
government agency requests that we make changes to our contractual agreement during a protest
period, but the government agency is unable or unwilling to modify the contract at the end of the
protest period (whether or not we are successful in defending the protest), then we may be unable
to recover the full costs incurred in making such changes. In addition, we may suffer negative
publicity as the result of any contract protest being upheld and our contract being terminated.
Further, if there is a re-bid of the contract, we would incur additional costs associated with the
re-bid process and be subject to a potential protest if we are awarded a subsequent contract.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Exercise of contract termination provisions and service level penalties</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Most of our contracts with our clients permit termination in the event our performance is not
consistent with service levels specified in those contracts, or provide for credits to our clients
for failure to meet service levels. In addition, if clients are not satisfied with our level of
performance, our clients may seek damages as permitted under the contract and/or our reputation in
the industry may suffer, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flow.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Pricing risks</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Many of our contracts contain provisions requiring that our services be priced based on a
pre-established standard or benchmark regardless of the costs we incur in performing these
services. Many of our contracts contain pricing provisions that require the client to pay a set fee
for our services regardless of whether our costs to perform these services exceed the amount of the
set fee. Some of our contracts contain re-pricing provisions which can result in reductions of our
fees for performing our services. In such situations, we are exposed to the risk that we may be
unable to price our services to levels that will permit recovery of our costs, and may adversely
affect our operating results and cash flow.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Actuarial consulting services and benefit plan management &#151; potential claims</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">In May&nbsp;2005, we acquired the human resources consulting business of Mellon Financial Corporation,
which includes actuarial consulting services related to commercial, governmental and Taft-Hartley
pension plans. Providers of these types of consulting services have experienced frequent claims,
some of which have resulted in litigation and significant settlements or judgments, particularly
when investment markets have performed poorly and pension funding levels have been adversely
impacted. In addition, our total benefits outsourcing business unit manages and administers
benefit plans on behalf of its clients and is responsible for processing numerous plan transactions
for current and former employees of those clients. We are subject to claims from the client and
its current and former employees if transactions are not properly processed. If any claim is made
against us in the future related to our actuarial consulting services or benefit plan management
services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be
materially adversely affected as a result of the time and cost required to defend such a claim, the
cost of settling such a claim or paying any judgments resulting therefrom, or the damage to our
reputation in the industry that could result from the negative publicity surrounding such a claim.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Loss of significant software vendor relationships</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Our ability to service our clients depends to a large extent on our use of various software
programs that we license from a small number of primary software vendors. If our significant
software vendors were to terminate, refuse to renew our contracts with them or offer to renew our
contracts with them on less advantageous terms than previously contracted, we might not be able to
replace the related software programs and would be unable to serve our clients or we would
recognize reduced margins from the contracts with our clients, either of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, revenues, profitability and cash flow.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We rely heavily on the use of intellectual property. We do not own the majority of the software
that we use to run our business; instead we license this software from a small number of primary
vendors. If these vendors assert claims that we or our clients are infringing on their software or
related intellectual property, we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims, which could
have a material effect on our profitability and cash flow. In addition, if any of our vendors&#146;
infringement claims are ultimately successful, our vendors could require us (1)&nbsp;to cease selling or
using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology, (2)&nbsp;to obtain a
license or additional licenses from our vendors, or (3)&nbsp;to redesign our products and services which
rely on the challenged software or technology. If we are unsuccessful in the defense of an
infringement claim and our vendors require us to initiate any of the above actions, then such
actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role
as a service provider and as an employer. As a result, we are subject to numerous United States
(both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect
individually identifiable information, including social security numbers, financial and health
information. For example, in 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act and as required therein, the Department of Health and Human Services established
regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of
individually identifiable health information. We have taken measures to comply with each of those
regulations on or before the required dates. Another example is the European Union Directive on
Data Protection, entitled &#147;Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24
October&nbsp;1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on
the free movement of such data&#148;. We have also taken steps to address the requirements of that
Directive. Other United States (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to the
processing of individually identifiable information as well, and additional legislation may be
enacted at any time. Failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to, among other
things, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity,
restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not
performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our
profitability and cash flow.

facilities and to protect confidential information and information related to identifiable
individuals from unauthorized access through our information systems, but we are subject to breach
of security systems at the facilities at which we maintain such confidential customer information
and information relating to identifiable individuals. If unauthorized users gain physical access
to the facility or electronic access to our information systems, such information may be subject to
theft and misuse. Any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things,
unfavorable publicity, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our clients that we
have not performed our contractual obligations and possible financial obligations for damages
related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which may have a material adverse effect
on our profitability and cash flow. We anticipate that breaches of security will occur from time

Our international operations and acquisitions are subject to a number of risks. These risks include
the possible impact on our operations of the laws of foreign countries where we may do business
including, among others, data privacy, laws regarding licensing and labor council requirements. In
addition, we may experience difficulty integrating the management and operations of businesses we
acquire internationally, and we may have difficulty attracting, retaining and motivating highly
skilled and qualified personnel to staff key managerial positions in our ongoing international
operations. Further, our international operations and acquisitions are subject to a number of
risks related to general economic and political conditions in foreign countries where we operate,
including, among others, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, cultural differences,
political instability and additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in
geographically distant locations. Our international operations and acquisitions may also be
impacted by trade restrictions, such as tariffs and duties or other trade controls imposed by the
United States or other jurisdictions, as well as other factors that may adversely affect our
business, financial condition and operating results. Because of these foreign operations we are
subject to regulations, such as those administered by the Department of Treasury&#146;s Office of
Foreign Assets Controls (&#147;OFAC&#148;) and export control regulations administered by the Department of
Commerce. Violation of these regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against our

may directly impact our physical facilities and operations, which are located in North America,
Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Australia, Asia and the Middle East, or those of

unable to contract with qualified, competent subcontractors, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. Experienced and capable personnel
in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their
talents. Our success also depends on the skills, experience, and performance of key members of our

$21.2&nbsp;billion of loans, as of June&nbsp;30, 2005, made under the Federal Family Education Loan Program,
which loans are guaranteed by a Federal government agency. If a loan is in default, then a claim
is made upon the guarantor. If the guarantor denies the claim because of a servicing error, then
under certain of the servicing agreements we may be required to purchase the loan from the lender.
Upon purchase of the loan, we attempt to cure the servicing errors and either sell the loan back to
the guarantor (which must occur within a specified period of time) or sell the loan on the open
market to a third party. We are subject to the risk that we may be unable to cure the servicing
errors or sell the loan on the open market. Our reserves, which are based on historical
information, may be inadequate if our servicing performance results in the requirement that we
repurchase a substantial number of loans, which repurchase could have a material adverse impact on

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, changes in market value of financial
instruments caused by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Sensitivity
analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in the interest rates and foreign
exchange rates on our results of operations or financial position. The following analysis provides
a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates as of June&nbsp;30, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We entered into fixed rate Senior Notes during fiscal year 2005. The Senior Notes are subject to
market risk from changes in interest rates. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a
near-term adverse movement of 10% in market interest rates. If these rates were 10% higher or
lower at June&nbsp;30, 2005, the fair value of the Senior Notes would be approximately $485&nbsp;million or
$515&nbsp;million, respectively. Changes in the fair value of our fixed rate Senior Notes would not
impact our results of operations or cash flows, unless redeemed prior to maturity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have variable rate debt instruments. Our variable rate debt instruments are subject to market
risk from changes in interest rates. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term
adverse movement of 10% in short-term market interest rates. If these rates averaged 10% higher or
lower during fiscal years 2005 and 2004, there would have been no material adverse impact on our
results of operations or cash flows.

currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-United
States denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. Risk can be estimated by
measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the
U.S. dollar. If these rates averaged 10% higher or lower during fiscal year 2005 and 2004, there
would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Affiliated Computer Services, Inc.:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have completed an integrated audit of Affiliated Computer Services, Inc.&#146;s 2005 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and
audits of its 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Consolidated financial statements</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. and
its subsidiaries at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial
statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Internal control over financial reporting</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Also, in our opinion, management&#146;s assessment, included in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 based on criteria established in <I>Internal
Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005, based on criteria established in <I>Internal
Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the COSO. The Company&#146;s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management&#146;s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As described in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has
excluded the human resources consulting and outsourcing businesses of Mellon Financial Corporation
(the &#147;Acquired HR Business&#148;) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of
June&nbsp;30, 2005 because they were acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during
2005. We have also excluded the Acquired HR Business from our audit of internal control over
financial reporting. The Acquired HR Business is wholly-owned by the Company and its total
revenues and total assets represent 2.4% and 13.3%, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2005.

time-critical, transaction-intensive business and information processing needs, and we typically
service these needs through long-term contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The consolidated financial statements are comprised of our accounts and the accounts of our
majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Investment in business entities in which we do not have control, but
have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are
accounted for by the equity method. Other investments are accounted for by the cost method. Our
fiscal year ends on June&nbsp;30. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that
require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the accompanying notes. These estimates are
based on information available to us. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Cash and cash equivalents</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash, short-term investments in commercial paper,
and money market investments that have an initial maturity of three months or less. Cash
equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Allowance for doubtful accounts</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We specifically analyze
accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends,
and changes in our customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of our
allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account
receivable may result in additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period
in which the change occurs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Property, equipment and software, net</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for equipment ranges primarily from 3
to 12&nbsp;years and for buildings and improvements up to 40&nbsp;years. Leasehold improvements are
depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated life.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, &#147;Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use&#148; (&#147;SOP 98-1&#148;), certain costs related to the development or purchase of
internal-use software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software
upon reaching technological feasibility. Costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements, which will
not result in additional functionality, are expensed as incurred. During fiscal years 2005, 2004
and 2003, we capitalized approximately $47&nbsp;million, $53.1&nbsp;million and $44&nbsp;million, respectively, in
software costs under SOP 98-1, which are being amortized over expected useful lives, which range
from 3 to 9&nbsp;years. These capitalized amounts include internal costs of approximately $12.9
million, $12.2&nbsp;million and $19.9&nbsp;million and external costs of approximately $34.1&nbsp;million, $40.9
million and $24.1&nbsp;million for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These costs were
incurred primarily in the development of our proprietary software used in connection with our
long-term client relationships.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;86, &#147;Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed&#148; (&#147;SFAS 86&#148;), certain costs related to
the development of software to be sold to our clients are capitalized and amortized over the
estimated useful life of the software upon reaching technological feasibility. During fiscal years
2005, 2004 and 2003, we capitalized approximately $10.1&nbsp;million, $3.9&nbsp;million and $4.8&nbsp;million,
respectively, in software costs under SFAS 86, which are being amortized over expected useful
lives, which range from 3 to 10&nbsp;years. These capitalized amounts include internal costs of
approximately $8.6&nbsp;million, $2.5&nbsp;million and $3.5&nbsp;million and external costs of approximately $1.5
million, $1.4&nbsp;million and $1.3&nbsp;million for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
increase in costs over previous years is related to our development of system software in our
Government segment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Goodwill</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Due to the fact that we are primarily a services company, our business acquisitions typically
result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of
future period amortization expense and possible expense we could incur as a result of an
impairment. The determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and
assumptions about future business trends and growth. We continually evaluate whether events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. In
evaluating impairment, we estimate the sum of expected future cash flows derived from the goodwill
and future revenues, costs and expenses and other factors. If an event occurs which would cause us
to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill, such revision
could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial
results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Other intangible assets</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Other intangible assets consist primarily of acquired customer-related intangibles, and contract
and migration costs related to new business activity, both of which are recorded at cost and
amortized using the straight-line method over the contract terms. In connection with our revenue
arrangements, we incur costs to originate contracts and to perform the transition and setup
activities necessary to enable us to perform under the terms of the arrangement. We capitalize
certain incremental direct costs which are related to the contract origination or transition,
implementation and setup activities and amortize them over the term of the arrangement. From time
to time, we also provide certain inducements to clients in the form of various arrangements,
including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over
the term of the contract. The amortization period of customer-related intangible assets ranges
from 1 to 17&nbsp;years, with a weighted average of approximately 10&nbsp;years. The amortization period for
all other intangible assets, excluding title plants and tradenames with indefinite useful lives,
ranges from 3 to 20&nbsp;years, with a weighted average of 6&nbsp;years. For all the fiscal year 2005 and
2004 acquisitions and the CyberRep acquisition in fiscal year 2003, we obtained a third-party
valuation of the intangible assets from Value Incorporated. The determination of the value of other
intangible assets requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth.
We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of
intangible assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating impairment, we estimate the sum of
expected future cash flows derived from the intangible asset. Such evaluation is significantly
impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues, costs and expenses and other factors. If
an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the
value of our other intangible assets, such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that
could have a material impact on our financial results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Other assets</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Other assets primarily consist of long-term receivables, long-term investments related to our
deferred compensation plans (see Note 13), long-term investments accounted for using the cost and
equity methods, long-term deposits and deferred debt issuance costs. It is our policy to
periodically review the net realizable value of our long-term receivables and investments through
an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of each receivable and investment. For
the investments related to our deferred compensation plans, we carry the assets at their fair
value, with changes in fair value included in our results of operations. Each investment is
reviewed to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which indicate that the
recoverability of the carrying amount may be uncertain. In the event that an investment is found to
be carried at an amount in excess of its recoverable amount, the asset would be adjusted for
impairment to a level commensurate with the recoverable amount of the underlying asset. Deferred
debt issuance costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the related debt,
which approximates the effective interest method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Derivative Instruments</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We may, from time to time, enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to
certain risks. We hedged the cash flow exposure to variability in interest rates on our Senior
Notes (defined below) by using forward interest rate agreements and accounted for these instruments
as cash flow hedges in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.
133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 133&#148;). As such, the change in the
fair value of our derivative financial instruments is initially recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income and reclassified to the same statement of income category as the hedged item
in the period in which the hedged transaction occurs. In addition, we classify payments received
or paid related to cash flow and fair value hedges in the same category of the consolidated
statements of cash flows as the item being hedged.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue recognition</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">A significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that does not
require significant estimates or uncertainties. For example, transaction volumes and time and
costs under time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific, objective
criteria under the contracts. Accordingly, revenues recognized under these methods do not require
the use of significant estimates that are susceptible to change. Revenue recognized using the
percentage-of-completion accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as
discussed below.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our policy follows the guidance from SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148; (&#147;SAB
104&#148;). SAB 104 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in
financial statements and updates Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13 to be consistent with Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;00-21, &#147;Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables&#148; (&#147;EITF
00-21&#148;). We recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services
have been provided to the client, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
reasonably assured.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal year 2005, approximately 73% of our revenue was recognized based on transaction
volumes, approximately 14% was fixed fee based, wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our
performance obligations under the arrangement, approximately 8% was related to cost reimbursable
contracts, approximately 3% of our revenue was recognized using percentage-of-completion accounting
and the remainder is related to time and material contracts. Our revenue mix is subject to change
due to the impact of acquisitions and new business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as
incurred, such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience. Revenues on
unit-price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and
accepted by the client. Revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual
rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues for business process outsourcing services are recognized as services are rendered,
generally on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed. Information technology
processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client, generally at the
contractual selling prices of resources consumed or capacity utilized by our clients. Revenues from
annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period.
Revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties
regarding customer acceptance have expired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system
development and implementation services are recognized over the contract term based on the
percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared
with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire
contract using Statement of Position 81-1, &#147;Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts&#148; (&#147;SOP 81-1&#148;). SOP 81-1 requires the use of
percentage-of-completion accounting for long-term contracts that are binding agreements between us
and our customers in which we agree, for compensation, to perform a service to the customer&#146;s
specifications. These services require that we perform significant, extensive and complex design,
development, modification and implementation activities for our customers&#146; systems. Performance
will often extend over long periods, and our right to receive future payment depends on our future
performance in accordance with the agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The percentage-of-completion methodology involves recognizing revenue using the percentage of
services completed, on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis, using a reasonably consistent
profit margin over the period. Due to the longer term nature of these projects, developing the
estimates of costs often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in
estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not
limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work
to be performed, and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity
or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and
revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such
revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision
become known.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">EITF 00-21 addresses the accounting treatment for an arrangement to provide the delivery or
performance of multiple products and/or services where the delivery of a product or system or
performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time.
The Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) reached a consensus regarding, among other issues, the applicability
of the provisions regarding separation of contract elements in EITF 00-21 to contracts where one or
more elements fall within the scope of other authoritative literature, such as SOP 81-1. EITF 00-21
does not impact the use of SOP 81-1 for contract elements that fall within the scope of SOP 81-1,
such as the implementation or development of an information technology system to client
specifications under a long-term contract. Where an implementation or development project is
contracted with a client, and we will also provide services or operate the system over a period of
time, EITF 00-21 provides the methodology for separating the contract elements and allocating total
arrangement consideration to the contract elements. We adopted the provisions of EITF 00-21 on a
prospective basis to transactions entered into after July&nbsp;1, 2003. We believe that EITF 00-21 did
not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues earned in excess of related billings are accrued, whereas billings in excess of revenues
earned are deferred until the related services are provided. We recognize revenues for
non-refundable, upfront implementation fees over the period between the initiation of the ongoing
services through the end of the contract term on a straight-line basis.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We account for claims and contingencies in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;5, &#147;Accounting for Contingencies&#148; (&#147;SFAS 5&#148;). SFAS 5 requires that we record an
estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our
financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability
has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment. We
consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts
and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our contracts with clients typically span several years. We continuously review and reassess our
estimates of contract profitability. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a
loss accrual is recorded in the consolidated financial statements in the period it is first
identified. Circumstances that could potentially result in contract losses over the life of the
contract include decreases in volumes of transactions, variances from expected costs to deliver our
services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Income taxes</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of
estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is
required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish
reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe
that certain positions may be challenged and that we may not succeed. Our provision for income
taxes includes the impact of these reserve changes. In the event that there is a significant
unusual or one-time item recognized in our operating results, the taxes attributable to that item
would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. We
adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which such
differences are expected to reverse. We routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine
the likelihood of their realization. See Note 10 for discussion of income taxes.
</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the combination of dilutive common
share equivalents and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
See Note 14 for the computation of earnings per share.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair value of each option grant was estimated at the date of grant using a separate
Black-Scholes option pricing calculation for each grant. The following weighted average
assumptions were used for grants in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003: dividend yield of 0% in all
years for all plans; volatility of 24.58%, 30.25% and 34.65%, for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively, for all plans; risk-free interest rates of 3.91%, 3.46% and 3.74% for fiscal
years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, for all plans; and weighted average expected option life
of 4.77, 5.50 and 5.50&nbsp;years for the 1997 Plan for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The average fair values of the options granted during fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 are
estimated at $14.86, $15.70 and $14.49.

123(R) requires companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair
value method and recognize compensation cost in its financial statements. SFAS 123(R) is effective
beginning as of the first annual reporting period beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005. We will adopt
SFAS 123(R) beginning July&nbsp;1, 2005 for new awards of stock-based compensation granted after that
date and for unvested awards outstanding at that date, following the modified prospective method.
Under this method, prior period amounts will not be restated. We believe the impact on our results
of operations of SFAS 123(R) will be consistent with our historical disclosure of pro forma stock
compensation information under SFAS 123; however, excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock
options which was historically classified as net cash provided by operating activities pursuant to

pension plans for the Acquired HR Business employees located in Canada and the United Kingdom (the
&#147;UK&#148;). The Canadian Acquired HR Business has both a funded basic pension plan and an unfunded
excess pension plan. The UK pension scheme is a funded plan. These defined benefit plans provide
benefits for participating employees based on years of service and average compensation for a
specified period before retirement. We account for these plans using Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;87, &#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Pensions&#148; (&#147;SFAS 87&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to these pension plans, we also assumed a post-employment medical plan for Canadian
Acquired HR Business employees and retirees. The amount of health care benefits is limited to
lifetime maximum and age limitations as described in the plan. We account for this plan using
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;106, &#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions&#148; (&#147;SFAS 106&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Fiscal year 2005 acquisitions</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">During fiscal year 2005, we completed six acquisitions, the most significant of which was the
acquisition of the human resources consulting and outsourcing businesses of Mellon Financial
Corporation (the &#147;Acquired HR Business&#148;) in May&nbsp;2005. The Acquired HR Business provides consulting
services, benefit plan administration services, and multi-scope HR outsourcing services. The
transaction was valued at approximately $405&nbsp;million, plus related transaction costs and was
initially funded from borrowings under our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 9). The purchase
price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair value as of
the date of acquisition. We acquired assets of $597.1&nbsp;million and assumed liabilities of $192.1
million. We recorded $209.4&nbsp;million in goodwill, of which 81% is deductible for income tax
purposes, and intangible assets of $166.7&nbsp;million. The $166.7&nbsp;million of intangible assets is
attributable to customer relationships, non-compete agreements and an indefinite lived tradename.
The customer relationships and non-compete agreements have useful lives of 3 to 17&nbsp;years with a
weighted average anticipated useful life of approximately 15&nbsp;years. As part of our integration of
the Acquired HR Business, we recorded $22.3&nbsp;million in involuntary employee termination costs for
employees of the Acquired HR Business in accordance with EITF Issue
No. 95-3, &#147;Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Business Combination.&#148; From the acquisition date through June&nbsp;30, 2005,
$1.8&nbsp;million in involuntary employee termination payments have been made and charged against
accrued compensation. We believe this acquisition makes us a stronger competitor in the end-to-end
human resources marketplace and strengthens our position as a global provider of business process
outsourcing services. The operating results of the acquired business are included in our financial
statements in the Commercial segment from the effective date of the acquisition, May&nbsp;1, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2005, we completed the acquisition of Superior Consultant Holdings Corporation
(&#147;Superior&#148;), acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Superior through a cash tender
offer, which was completed on January&nbsp;25, 2005, and subsequent short-form merger, at a purchase
price of $8.50 per share. Superior provides information technology consulting and business process
outsourcing services and solutions to the healthcare industry. The transaction was valued at
approximately $122.2&nbsp;million (including payment of approximately $106&nbsp;million for issued and
outstanding shares, options, and warrants and additional amounts for debentures and other payments)
plus related transaction costs and was funded from borrowings under our Credit Facility. The
purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair
value as of the date of acquisition. We acquired assets of $159.2&nbsp;million and assumed liabilities
of $37&nbsp;million. We recorded $68.8&nbsp;million in goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax
purposes, and intangible assets of $16.8&nbsp;million. The $16.8&nbsp;million of intangible assets is
attributable to customer relationships and non-compete agreements with useful lives of 5&nbsp;years. We
believe this acquisition expands our provider healthcare subject matter expertise, as well as
providing experience with  major hospital information systems and additional healthcare
management talent. The operating results of the acquired business are included in our financial
statements in the Commercial segment from the effective date of the acquisition, January&nbsp;25, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2004, we acquired BlueStar Solutions, Inc. (&#147;BlueStar&#148;), an information technology
outsourcer specializing in applications management of packaged enterprise resource planning and
messaging services. The transaction was valued at approximately $73.5&nbsp;million, plus related
transaction costs. The transaction value includes $6.4&nbsp;million attributable to the 9.2% minority
interest we held in BlueStar prior to the acquisition; therefore, the net purchase price was
approximately $67.1&nbsp;million. Of this amount, approximately $61&nbsp;million was paid to former BlueStar
shareholders by June&nbsp;30, 2005 and was funded from borrowings under our credit facilities and cash
on hand. The remaining purchase price of $6&nbsp;million will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2006. The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. We acquired assets of $97.8&nbsp;million and assumed
liabilities of $30.7&nbsp;million. We recorded goodwill of $34.4&nbsp;million, which is not deductible for
income tax purposes, and intangible assets of $11.6&nbsp;million. The $11.6&nbsp;million of intangible
assets is attributable to customer relationships with a useful life of seven years. We believe
that the acquisition of BlueStar improves our existing information technology services with the
addition of applications management and messaging services. The operating results of the acquired
business are included in our financial statements in the Commercial segment from the effective date
of the acquisition, August&nbsp;26, 2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2004, we acquired Heritage Information Systems, Inc. (&#147;Heritage&#148;). Heritage provides
clinical management and pharmacy cost containment solutions to 14 state Medicaid programs, over a
dozen national commercial insurers and Blue Cross Blue Shield licensees and some of the largest
employer groups in the country. The transaction was valued at approximately $23.1&nbsp;million plus
related transaction costs, excluding contingent consideration of up to $17&nbsp;million maximum based
upon future financial performance, and was funded from borrowings under our Prior Facility and cash
on hand. During fiscal year 2005, we accrued $6.3&nbsp;million of contingent consideration, which was
earned during the year. The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. We acquired assets of $32.9
million and assumed liabilities of $3.5&nbsp;million. We recorded $20.5&nbsp;million in goodwill, which is
deductible for income tax purposes, and intangible assets of $2.4&nbsp;million. The $2.4&nbsp;million of
intangible assets is attributable to customer relationships and non-compete agreements with useful
lives of five years. We believe this acquisition enhances our clinical management and cost
containment service offerings. The operating results of the acquired business are included in our
financial statements in the Government segment from the effective date of the acquisition, July&nbsp;1,
2004.

of acquisition. We acquired assets of $152.6&nbsp;million and assumed liabilities of $52.5&nbsp;million.
Included in the assets acquired are goodwill of $88.9&nbsp;million, which is deductible for income tax
purposes, and $26.8&nbsp;million in intangible assets. The $26.8&nbsp;million of intangible assets are
attributable to customer relationships and non-compete agreements with useful lives ranging from 5
to 8&nbsp;years, with a weighted average anticipated useful life of approximately 6&nbsp;years. The
operating results of the acquired business are included in our financial statements primarily in
the Commercial segment from the effective date of the acquisition, November&nbsp;1, 2003. We believe
this transaction expands our client bases representing the manufacturing, automotive, retail,
financial services and communications industries and provides acquired clients with access to
additional BPO and IT services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2004, we completed the acquisition of Patient Accounting Services Center, LLC (&#147;PASC&#148;),
a provider of revenue cycle management for healthcare providers, including billing, accounts
receivables, and collection services. The transaction was valued at approximately $94.9&nbsp;million,
excluding contingent consideration of a maximum of $25&nbsp;million based on future financial
performance, plus related transaction costs, and was funded from cash on hand. No payments were
made related to the contingent consideration provision, which expired in January&nbsp;2005. The
purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair
value as of the date of acquisition. We acquired assets of $104.3&nbsp;million and assumed liabilities
of $9.4&nbsp;million. We recorded goodwill of $71.9&nbsp;million, which is deductible for income tax
purposes, and $9.3&nbsp;million in intangible assets. The $9.3&nbsp;million of intangible assets are
attributable to customer relationships and non-compete agreements with useful lives of 5&nbsp;years.
The operating results of the acquired business are included in our financial statements in the
Commercial segment from the effective date of the acquisition, January&nbsp;3, 2004. We believe this
transaction expands the suite of business process outsourcing solutions we can offer new and
existing healthcare clients.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2004, we completed the acquisition of Truckload Management Services, Inc. (&#147;TMI&#148;), an
expedited document processing and business process improvement services provider for the trucking
industry. The transaction was valued at approximately $28.1&nbsp;million, excluding contingent
consideration of a maximum of $14&nbsp;million based upon future financial performance, plus related
transaction costs, and was funded from cash on hand. During fiscal year 2005, we paid $6.8&nbsp;million
of contingent consideration, which was earned during the year. The purchase price was allocated to
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair value as of the date of
acquisition. We acquired assets of $37&nbsp;million and assumed liabilities of $2.1&nbsp;million. We
recorded goodwill of $29.7&nbsp;million, which is deductible for income tax purposes, and $2.5&nbsp;million
in intangible assets attributable to customer relationships and non-compete agreements with useful
lives of 4 to 6&nbsp;years, with a weighted average anticipated useful life of approximately 6&nbsp;years.
The operating results of the acquired business are included in our financial statements in the
Commercial segment from the effective date of the acquisition, February&nbsp;1, 2004. We believe this
transaction will expand our business process outsourcing service offerings in the transportation
industry, adding document management and document processing services for long-haul trucking fleets
to our list of services.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">During fiscal year 2003, we acquired five companies, the most significant of which was the
acquisition of CyberRep, Inc. (&#147;CyberRep&#148;) in January&nbsp;2003. CyberRep, which is included in our
Commercial segment, provides customer care and customer relationship management services for the
telecommunications, wireless communications, technology, and consumer products industries. The
transaction was valued at approximately $42&nbsp;million, excluding contingent consideration of a
maximum of $3&nbsp;million based upon future financial performance, plus transaction costs. During
fiscal year 2004, we paid $3&nbsp;million of contingent consideration, which was earned during the year.
The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated
fair value as of the date of acquisition. We acquired assets  of $59.6&nbsp;million and assumed
liabilities of $14.6&nbsp;million. We recorded goodwill of $36.3&nbsp;million, which is fully deductible for
income tax purposes, and $5.5&nbsp;million in customer related intangible assets, which are attributable
to customer relationships with useful lives of approximately 7&nbsp;years. CyberRep&#146;s operating results are
included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition,
January&nbsp;1, 2003. We believe this transaction expands our suite of business process outsourcing
solutions for commercial clients worldwide by enhancing high-volume, customer care center
capability and CRM business process outsourcing solutions for Fortune 500 companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We completed four other small acquisitions during fiscal year 2003, all of which were included in

upon satisfaction of certain contractual criteria in conjunction with certain acquisitions. During
fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, we made contingent consideration payments of $17&nbsp;million, $10.4
million and $8&nbsp;million, respectively, related to acquisitions completed in prior years. As of June
30, 2005, the maximum aggregate amount of the outstanding contingent obligations to former
shareholders of acquired entities is approximately $45.5&nbsp;million, of which $6.3&nbsp;million has been
earned as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. The $6.3&nbsp;million was accrued as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and is expected to be
paid during the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Any such payments primarily result in a
corresponding increase in goodwill.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Effective November&nbsp;1, 2003, we completed the sale of a majority of our Federal government business
to Lockheed Martin Corporation (the &#147;Divested Federal Business&#148;) for approximately $649.4&nbsp;million,
which included a cash payment of $586.5&nbsp;million at closing and $70&nbsp;million payable pursuant to a
five-year non-compete agreement, less a working capital settlement of $7.1&nbsp;million paid in the
third quarter of fiscal year 2004. Assets sold were approximately $346.8&nbsp;million and liabilities
assumed by Lockheed Martin Corporation were approximately $67.9&nbsp;million, both of which were
primarily in the Government segment. We recognized a pretax gain of $285.3&nbsp;million ($182.3&nbsp;million,
net of income tax) in fiscal year 2004. The after tax proceeds from the divestiture were generally
used to pay down debt, fund the acquisitions of Lockheed Martin Corporation&#146;s commercial
information technology outsourcing business, Patient Accounting Services Center, LLC, Truckload
Management Services, Inc. (see Note 2) and etravelexperts, LLC and fund our share repurchase
programs (see Note 11).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from the Divested Federal Business, which are primarily included in the Government
segment, were approximately $237.7&nbsp;million and $680.1&nbsp;million for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2004 and
2003, respectively. This divestiture excludes, among others, our Department of Education
relationship. Additionally, our Commercial and Government operations will continue to serve as a
subcontractor on portions of the Divested Federal Business.

Long-Lived Assets&#148; requires that depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets held for sale
be suspended during the holding period prior to sale. Accordingly, we suspended depreciation and
amortization prior to consummation of the sale in the amount of $6.2&nbsp;million ($3.9&nbsp;million, net of
income tax) in fiscal year 2004, respectively, related to those long-lived assets sold.

contracts, we reported revenue in our Government segment of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million, $17.2

agreed to indemnify ManTech with respect to the Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;) investigation related
to purchasing activities at Hanscom during the period 1998-2000 (see Note 17). In the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2004, we sold an additional small contractual relationship to ManTech
International Corporation. We reported revenue in our Government segment of approximately $0.2
million, $3.1&nbsp;million and $4.2&nbsp;million for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, for this contract.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Amortization includes amounts charged to amortization expense for customer contract costs and other
intangibles, other than contract inducements. Amortization of contract inducements of $14.3
million, $11&nbsp;million and $7.3&nbsp;million for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is
recorded as a reduction to related contract revenue. Amortization for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and
2003 includes approximately $27.7&nbsp;million, $21.9&nbsp;million and $16.2&nbsp;million, respectively, related
to acquired customer-related intangibles. Amortized intangible assets are amortized over the
related contract term. The amortization period of customer-related intangible assets ranges from 1
to 17&nbsp;years, with a weighted average of approximately 10&nbsp;years. The amortization period for all
other intangible assets, including trademarks, ranges from 3 to 20&nbsp;years, with a weighted average
of 6&nbsp;years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>7. OTHER ASSETS</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other assets primarily consist of long-term receivables, long-term investments related to our
deferred compensation plans (see Note 13), long-term investments accounted for using the cost
method and equity method, long-term deposits, and deferred debt issuance costs. During fiscal
years 2004 and 2003, we recorded $274 thousand ($174 thousand, net of income tax) and $3.4&nbsp;million
($2.1&nbsp;million, net of income tax), respectively, in other non-operating expense associated with the
write-down of several long-term investments to their estimated net realizable value. We had
approximately $65.5&nbsp;million and $26.8&nbsp;million in long-term investments as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and
2004, respectively, primarily related to our deferred compensation plans (see Notes 13 and 15).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Senior Notes</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">On June&nbsp;6, 2005, we completed a public offering of $250&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of 4.70%
 Senior Notes due June&nbsp;1, 2010 and $250&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of 5.20%
Senior Notes due June&nbsp;1, 2015 (collectively the &#147;Senior Notes&#148;). Interest on the Senior
Notes is payable semiannually. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $496&nbsp;million,
after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses, were used to repay a portion of
the outstanding balance of our Credit Facility (defined below), part of which was incurred in
connection with the acquisition of the Acquired HR Business. We may redeem some or all of the
Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity, which may include prepayment penalties determined
according to pre-established criteria. See Note 15 for a discussion of the forward interest rate
hedges related to the issuance of the Senior Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Senior Notes contain customary covenants, including but not limited to, restrictions on our
ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to create or incur secured indebtedness, merge or
consolidate with another person, or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the principal of and all accrued and unpaid
interest on all the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable by the trustee, The Bank of New
York Trust Company, N.A., or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Notes. Such events of default include, but are not limited to, payment default, covenant
defaults, material payment defaults (other than under the Senior Notes) and voluntary or
involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, we were in compliance with the covenants
of our Senior Notes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Credit Facilities</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">On October&nbsp;27, 2004, we entered into a Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent (&#147;JP Morgan&#148;), and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as Syndication Agent, and a syndication of 19 other lenders (the &#147;Credit
Facility&#148;). Proceeds from advances under the Credit Facility are used for general corporate
purposes, to fund acquisitions and for repurchases under our share repurchase programs. The Credit
Facility provides for an unsecured $1.5&nbsp;billion multi-currency revolving credit and competitive
advance facility (fully available in U.S. dollars, Euros or competitive loans in any currency).
Multi-currency commitments (available in certain specified currencies
other than U.S. dollars or
Euros) in an initial aggregate amount of $200&nbsp;million and swing line loans in an amount up to $150
million are provided under the facility. Subject to affirmation of representations and warranties,
status of no default and commitments by willing lenders, the Credit Facility may be increased by up
to an additional $300&nbsp;million. The lending commitments under the Credit Facility are scheduled to
terminate October&nbsp;27, 2009. The terms and rates of the Credit Facility are generally more favorable
than those of the Prior Facility (defined below). At the closing of the Credit Facility, we
borrowed $316&nbsp;million under the Credit Facility to pay off and terminate the Prior Facility. In
addition, $94&nbsp;million in letters of credit were issued at closing under the Credit Facility to
replace letters of credit outstanding under the Prior Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other than competitive loans and swing line loans, advances under the Credit Facility bear interest
at a Base Rate (generally equal to the prime rate of JP Morgan) or a Eurocurrency rate plus a
percentage (ranging from 0.220% to 0.775%, currently 0.39%) determined based on our credit rating.
We are required to pay accrued interest at established intervals based upon our elected interest
period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Among other fees, we pay a facility fee of 0.110% per annum (due quarterly), based on our credit
rating on the aggregate commitment of the Credit Facility, whether used or unused. We also pay a
utilization fee of 0.125% on the total amount outstanding under the Credit Facility for each day
that such amount exceeds 50% of the aggregate commitments then in effect.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Credit Facility contains customary covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on our
ability, and in certain instances, our subsidiaries&#146; ability, to incur liens, merge or dissolve,
finance accounts receivables, or sell or transfer assets. The Credit Facility also limits our
ability to incur additional indebtedness at the subsidiary level. In addition, we may not permit
our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 2.75 to 1.0 or our consolidated interest coverage ratio
to be less than 3.50 to 1.0.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the Credit Facility may be
accelerated and the lending commitments under the Credit Facility terminated. Such events of
default include, but are not limited to, payment default to lenders, material inaccuracies of
representations and warranties, covenant defaults, material payment defaults (other than under the
Credit Facility), voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material money judgments,
material ERISA events, or change of control. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, we were in compliance with the
covenants of our Credit Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Simultaneously with entering into the $1.5&nbsp;billion Credit Facility, we terminated our then existing
$875&nbsp;million revolving credit facility (the &#147;Prior Facility&#148;) on October&nbsp;27, 2004 and repaid the
$316&nbsp;million outstanding on the Prior Facility with borrowings under the Credit Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At June&nbsp;30, 2005, we had approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion available on our Credit Facility after giving
effect to outstanding indebtedness and $100.9&nbsp;million of outstanding letters of credit that secure
certain contractual performance and other obligations and which reduce the availability of our
Credit Facility. At June&nbsp;30, 2005, we had $0.2&nbsp;billion outstanding on our Credit Facility, which
is reflected in long-term debt, and of which substantially all bore interest from 3.61% to 3.72%.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Convertible Notes</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">On February&nbsp;27, 2004, we completed the redemption of our 3.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
February&nbsp;15, 2006 (the &#147;Convertible Notes&#148;). Holders of 99.9% of all the outstanding Convertible
Notes converted their Convertible Notes to 23.0234 shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock per $1,000
principal amount of Convertible Notes in accordance with the procedures specified in the related
indenture governing the Convertible Notes. As the result of such conversions, approximately 7.3&nbsp;million shares
of our Class&nbsp;A common stock were issued to such noteholders at the conversion price of $43.44 per
share. The remaining Convertible Notes were redeemed in cash at 101.4% of the principal amount,
resulting in a cash redemption of $269,000. The Convertible Notes were convertible at any time
prior to the maturity date, unless redeemed or repurchased, into Class&nbsp;A common stock at a
conversion rate of 23.0234 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of
Convertible Notes (equivalent to a conversion price of $43.44 per share of Class&nbsp;A common stock),
subject to adjustments in certain events. Interest on the Convertible Notes was payable
semi-annually on February&nbsp;15 and August&nbsp;15 of each year commencing August&nbsp;15, 2001.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;30, 2005, we had available unused domestic net
operating loss carryforwards (&#147;NOLs&#148;), net
of Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;382 limitations, of approximately $131.3&nbsp;million which will expire
over various periods from 2010 through 2024. In addition, we had available unused domestic state
tax credit carryforwards of $2.7&nbsp;million which some may be carried forward indefinitely. The
change in tax credits and loss carryforwards from June&nbsp;30, 2004 to June&nbsp;30, 2005 is primarily due
to net operating losses acquired in the Superior and Bluestar acquisitions completed during fiscal
year 2005. A valuation allowance of $14.5&nbsp;million and $3.7&nbsp;million was recorded at June&nbsp;30, 2005
and June&nbsp;30, 2004, respectively, against deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses
and tax credit carryforwards for which realization of any future benefit is uncertain due to
taxable income limitations. Of this amount, approximately $6.7&nbsp;million is related to acquisitions,
and if not utilized, would be reversed against goodwill. The change in valuation allowance from
June&nbsp;30, 2004 to June&nbsp;30, 2005 is primarily due to acquisitions. We routinely evaluate all deferred
tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. The valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets increased by $10.8&nbsp;million and $3.6&nbsp;million during the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The depreciation and amortization related deferred tax liabilities increased during the years ended
June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004 predominantly due to current tax deductions for acquired intangibles,
goodwill and depreciation. Generally, since the adoption of SFAS 142 eliminates the book goodwill
amortization, the difference between the cumulative book and tax bases of goodwill will continue to
grow as current tax deductions are realized. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, the amount of
deductible goodwill was $2&nbsp;billion and $1.7&nbsp;billion, respectively. In addition, accelerated tax
depreciation is provided for under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 on
capital expenditures through December&nbsp;2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The effective tax rate for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was 35.1% and 36.1%,
respectively, including
tax benefits recognized from the sale of the Divested Federal Business and research and development
tax credits. The divestiture benefits and research and development tax credits reduced our
effective tax rate for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 by 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries for which U.S. taxes have not been
provided are included in consolidated retained earnings in the amount of approximately $36.5
million, $16.8&nbsp;million and $5.5&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. These
earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. If future events necessitate
that these earnings should be repatriated to the U.S., an additional tax provision and related
liability may be required. If such earnings were distributed, U.S. income taxes would be partially
reduced by available credits for taxes paid to the jurisdictions in which the income was earned.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;22, 2004, the President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the
&#147;Act&#148;). The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. FASB Staff Position 109-2 &#147;Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for
the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004&#148; allows
companies additional time beyond that provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109 &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes&#148; to determine the impact of the Act on its financial statements
and provides guidance for the disclosure of the impact of the Act on the financial statements. At
June&nbsp;30, 2005, cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries for which U.S. taxes have
not been recorded totaled $36.5&nbsp;million, the tax effects on which, if repatriated, cannot be
reasonably estimated at this time. We are currently considering repatriation of amounts up to and
including $36.5&nbsp;million, pending completion of our analysis. This incentive is available to us
until June&nbsp;30, 2006. The 85% dividends received deduction is subject to a number of limitations,
and we have not yet decided whether, or to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that
have not yet been remitted to the U.S. We will continue to monitor our international activities
and expect to reach a decision regarding repatriation prior to the expiration of this incentive.

fiscal year 2004 include $88.1&nbsp;million related to the gain on the Divested Federal Business (see

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our Board of Directors has authorized two share repurchase programs totaling $1.25&nbsp;billion of our
Class&nbsp;A common stock. On September&nbsp;2, 2003, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a
share repurchase program of up to $500&nbsp;million of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and on April&nbsp;29, 2004,
we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new, incremental share repurchase program of
up to $750&nbsp;million of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. The programs, which are open-ended, will allow us
to repurchase our shares on the open market from time to time in accordance with SEC rules and
regulations, including shares that could be purchased pursuant to SEC Rule&nbsp;10b5-1. The number of
shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the level of cash and debt
balances, general business conditions and other factors, including alternative investment
opportunities. We intend to fund the repurchase programs from various sources, including, but not
limited to, cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under our existing revolving
Credit Facility. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, we had repurchased approximately 19.9&nbsp;million shares at a
total cost of approximately $994&nbsp;million and reissued 0.7&nbsp;million shares for proceeds totaling
$33.1&nbsp;million to fund contributions to our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan.

shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock for issuance to key employees at exercise prices determined by the
Board of Directors. In May&nbsp;2000, February&nbsp;2001, October&nbsp;2001, July&nbsp;2003 and February&nbsp;2005, the
Board of Directors approved the additional allotment of approximately 1.7&nbsp;million, 1.6&nbsp;million, 4.1
million, 3.8&nbsp;million and 2.7&nbsp;million shares, respectively, to the 1997 Plan in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the 1997 Plan authorized by our shareholders pursuant to our November&nbsp;14,
1997 Proxy Statement. Options granted under the 1997 Plan to our current employees cannot exceed
12.8% of our issued and outstanding shares, consequently, any share repurchases (as discussed
above) reduce the number of options to purchase shares that we may grant under the 1997 Plan. Our
1988 Stock Option Plan (the &#147;1988 Plan&#148;), which originally reserved 12&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock for issuance, was discontinued for new grants during fiscal year 1998 and terminated
(except for the exercise of then existing option grants as of September&nbsp;1997) and subsequently, 3.2
million unissued shares expired. Generally, the options under each plan vest in varying
increments over a five-year period, generally become exercisable as they vest, expire ten years
from the date of grant and are issued at exercise prices no less than 100% of the fair market value
of our Class&nbsp;A common stock at the time of the grant. As reported in Note 1, we have elected to
adopt the disclosure only provisions of SFAS 123 and we account for stock-based employee
compensation plans in accordance with APB 25. As a result, no compensation cost has been
recognized in the periods presented for stock option or employee stock purchase plans. As discussed
below, we will adopt SFAS 123(R) beginning July&nbsp;1, 2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In order to conform our stock option program with standard market practice, on February&nbsp;2, 2005,
our Board of Directors approved an amendment to stock options previously granted that did not
become exercisable until five years from the date of grant to provide that such options become
exercisable on the day they vest. Options granted under both our 1997 Plan and our 1988 Plan
generally vest in varying increments over a five year period. It is expected that future option
grants will contain matching vesting and exercise schedules. This amendment does not amend or
affect the vesting schedule, exercise price, quantity of options granted, shares into which such
options are exercisable or life of any award under any outstanding option grant. Therefore, no
compensation expense was recorded.

to the exercise of options granted under our 1988 Stock Option Plan in excess of the amount
originally registered with the SEC on Form S-8 filed November&nbsp;17, 1994 (Registration No.&nbsp;33-86426).
The exercise price of the options exercised ranged from $4.00 to $10.56 per share of Class&nbsp;A
common stock and the aggregate exercise price of the options was $9.6&nbsp;million. We believe the
grant of the options and the subsequent issuance of the underlying securities to the optionees was
exempt from registration pursuant to Rule&nbsp;506 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), or pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2) of the Securities Act. Each of the
optionees had access to sufficient information regarding Affiliated Computer Services, Inc.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Under our 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#147;ESPP&#148;), a maximum of 4&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock can be issued to substantially all full-time employees who elect to participate. In
October&nbsp;2002, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the ESPP to increase the number of
shares that can be issued under the plan from 2&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million. Through payroll deductions,
eligible participants may purchase our stock at a 15% discount to market value. The stock is
either purchased by the ESPP in the open market or issued from our treasury account, or a
combination of both, and our contributions for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, which
were charged to additional paid-in capital, were approximately $1&nbsp;million, $1.9&nbsp;million, and $3.3
million, respectively. During fiscal years 2005 and 2004, in addition to stock purchased by the
ESPP in the open market, we issued approximately 446,000 and 92,000 treasury shares to fund the
ESPP.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>SFAS 123(R)</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">As discussed in Note 1, we will adopt SFAS 123(R) beginning July&nbsp;1, 2005 for new awards of
stock-based compensation granted after that date and for unvested awards outstanding at that date,
following the modified prospective method. Under this method, prior period amounts will not be
restated. We believe the impact on our results of operations of SFAS 123(R) will be consistent
with our historical disclosure of pro forma stock compensation information under SFAS 123; however,
the excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options which was historically classified as net
cash provided by operating activities pursuant to the provisions of
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-15 &#147;Classification in the
Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a
Company upon Exercise of a nonqualified Employee Stock Option&#148; will be reported in net
cash provided by financing activities after the implementation of SFAS 123(R).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon
implementation of SFAS 123(R), we will begin expensing the share-based payment arrangement
using the modified prospective method. Prior to fiscal year 2006, we followed Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148; (&#147;APB 25&#148;), in accounting for
share-based payment arrangements. Under APB 25, no compensation expense was recognized since the
exercise prices of the awards under our plans were at the current market price of our stock on the
date of grant. The total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized at June
30, 2005 was approximately $112.5&nbsp;million. This is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average of 3.5&nbsp;years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>13. PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT PLANS</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the acquisition of the Acquired HR Business, we assumed pension plans for the
Acquired HR Business employees located in Canada and the United Kingdom (&#147;UK&#148;). The Canadian
Acquired HR Business has both a funded basic pension plan and an unfunded excess pension plan. The
UK pension scheme is a funded plan. These defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating
employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period before
retirement. We have established June&nbsp;30 as our measurement date for these defined benefit plans.
The net periodic benefit costs for these plans are included in wages and benefits in our financial
statements from the effective date of the acquisition, May&nbsp;1, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The measurement of the pension benefit obligation of the plans at the acquisition date was
accounted for using the business combination provisions in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;87, therefore, all previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss, unrecognized
prior service cost, or unrecognized net obligation or net asset existing prior to the date of the
acquisition was included in our calculation of the pension benefit obligation recorded at
acquisition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to these pension plans, we also assumed a post-employment medical plan for Acquired HR
Business employees and retirees in Canada. The amount of health care benefits is limited to
lifetime maximum and age limitations as described in the plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We estimate the long-term rate of return on UK and Canadian plan assets will be 7% and 7.5%,
respectively, based on the long-term target asset allocation. Expected returns for the following
asset classes used in the plan are based on a combination of long-term historical returns and
current and expected market conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The UK pension scheme&#146;s target asset allocation is 33% UK equities, 22% overseas equities
principally invested in developed markets, 17.5% bonds issued by UK corporates, 17.5% in UK
Treasury inflation-linked bonds and 10% in UK commercial property. External investment managers
actively manage all of the asset classes. The target asset allocation has been set by the plan&#146;s
trustee board with a view to meeting the long-term return assumed for setting the employer&#146;s
contributions while also reducing volatility relative to the plan&#146;s liabilities. The managers
engaged by the trustees manage their assets with a view to seeking moderate out-performance of
appropriate benchmarks for each asset class. At this time, the trustees do not engage in any
alternative investment strategies, apart from UK commercial property.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Canadian funded plan&#146;s target asset allocation is 37% Canadian provincial and corporate bonds,
33% larger capitalization Canadian stocks, 25% developed and larger capitalization Global ex-Canada
stocks (mainly U.S. and international stocks) and 5% cash and cash equivalents. A single
investment manager actively manages all of the asset classes. This manager uses an equal blend of
large cap value and large cap growth for stocks in order to participate in the returns generated by
stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. The bonds are managed using a
core approach where multiple strategies are engaged such as interest rate anticipation, credit
selection and yield curve positioning to mitigate overall risk. At this time, the manager does not
engage in any alternative investment strategies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">SFAS 106 requires the disclosure of assumed healthcare cost trend rates for next year used to
measure the expected cost of benefits covered. For measurement purposes, an 8.8% composite annual
rate of increase in the per capita costs of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for measurement
of the benefit obligation as well as the periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2005; this rate was
assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% by 2013 and remain at that level thereafter. The healthcare
cost trend rate assumption may have a significant effect on the SFAS 106 projections. The table below
illustrates the effect of increasing or decreasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rates by one
percentage point for each future year (in thousands):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Supplemental executive retirement plan</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">In December&nbsp;1998, we entered into a Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement with our Chairman,
Darwin Deason (&#147;Mr.&nbsp;Deason&#148;), which was amended in August&nbsp;2003 to conform the normal retirement
date specified therein to our fiscal year end next succeeding the termination of the Employment
Agreement between Mr.&nbsp;Deason and us. The normal retirement date under the Supplemental Executive
Retirement Agreement was subsequently amended in June&nbsp;2005 to conform to the termination date of
the Employment Agreement with the exception of the determination of any amount deferred in taxable
years prior to January&nbsp;1, 2005 for purposes of applying the provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 and the regulations and interpretive guidance published pursuant thereto (the
&#147;AJCA&#148;). Pursuant to the Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement, which was reviewed and
approved by the Board of Directors, Mr.&nbsp;Deason will receive a benefit upon the occurrence of
certain events equal to an actuarially calculated amount based on a percentage of his average
monthly compensation determined by his monthly compensation during the highest thirty-six
consecutive calendar months from among the 120 consecutive calendar months ending on the earlier of
his termination of employment or his normal retirement date. The amount of this benefit payable by
us will be offset by the value of particular options granted to Mr.&nbsp;Deason (including 150,000
shares covered by options granted in October&nbsp;1998 with an exercise price of $11.53 per share and
300,000 shares granted in August&nbsp;2003 with an exercise price of $44.10). To the extent that we
determine that our estimated actuarial liability under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
exceeds the &#147;in the money&#148; value of such options, such deficiency would be reflected in our results
of operations as of the date of such determination. In the event that the value of the options
granted to Mr.&nbsp;Deason exceeds the benefit, such excess benefit would accrue to Mr.&nbsp;Deason and we
would have no further obligation under this agreement. The percentage applied to the average
monthly compensation is 56% for benefit determinations made on or any time after May&nbsp;18, 2005. The
events triggering the benefit are retirement, total and permanent disability, death, resignation,
and change in control or termination for any reason other than cause. The benefit will be paid in
a lump sum or, at the election of Mr.&nbsp;Deason, in monthly installments over a period not to exceed
ten years. We have estimated that our obligation with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Deason under the Supplemental
Executive Retirement Agreement was $8.1&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and will be $16.17&nbsp;million at May
18, 2010 (based on the normal retirement date under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement
but excluding the implications of the AJCA). If the payment is caused by a change in control and at
such time Mr.&nbsp;Deason would be subject to an excise tax under the Internal Revenue Code with respect
to the benefit, the amount of the benefit will be grossed-up to offset this tax.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">We offer a deferred compensation plan to employees who meet specified compensation criteria. The
assets and liabilities of this plan are included in our consolidated financial statements.
Approximately 1,000 employees participate in the plan. Participants may elect to defer a specified
percentage of base salary and incentive compensation annually. The assets of the plan as of June
30, 2005 and 2004 were $29.2&nbsp;million and $19.2&nbsp;million, respectively. Liabilities of the plan,
representing participants&#146; account balances, were $32&nbsp;million and $20.4&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2005
and 2004, respectively, and were included in long-term liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the acquisition of the Acquired HR Business, we assumed a deferred compensation
plan for certain Acquired HR Business employees. This plan is currently closed to new
contributions. The assets and liabilities of this plan are included in our consolidated financial
statements as of the date of acquisition. Approximately 168 employees participate in the plan.
The assets of the plan as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 were $24&nbsp;million. Liabilities of the plan, representing
participants&#146; account balances, were $30.6&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and were included in long-term
liabilities.

allow for discretionary matching contributions by us as determined by our Board of Directors.
Contributions made by us to certain plans during the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were
approximately $13.4&nbsp;million, $14.8&nbsp;million and $24.5&nbsp;million, respectively.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to July&nbsp;2002, we held a minority preferred stock interest in DDH Aviation, Inc., a corporate
airplane brokerage company organized in 1997 (as may have been reorganized subsequent to July&nbsp;2002,
herein referred to as &#147;DDH&#148;). Our Chairman owns a majority voting interest in DDH and our
President and General Counsel, along with our Chairman were directors of DDH. At June&nbsp;30, 2002,
DDH had a $48&nbsp;million line of credit with Citicorp USA, Inc.,
(&#147;Citicorp&#148;) for which we and our Chairman, in
exchange for warrants to acquire additional voting stock, acted as partial guarantors. In
addition, we obtained access to corporate aircraft at favorable rates in consideration of our
guaranty. We had guaranteed up to approximately $11.5&nbsp;million of the line of credit and our
Chairman guaranteed up to approximately $17.5&nbsp;million of the line of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2002, our Chairman assumed in full our guaranty obligations to Citicorp and Citicorp
released in full our guaranty obligations. Our minority preferred stock interest and warrants
(with a recorded value of $100,000 at June&nbsp;30, 2002) in DDH were cancelled. We have no further
ownership interest in DDH. Our officers, other than the Chairman, are no longer directors of DDH.
As partial consideration for the release of our corporate guaranty, we entered into an agreement to
provide certain administrative services to DDH at no charge until such time as DDH meets certain
specified financial criteria. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, we purchased $1&nbsp;million in
prepaid charter flights at favorable rates from DDH. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, we had $0.6
million and $0.7&nbsp;million, respectively, remaining in prepaid flights with DDH. During fiscal year
2003, we paid DDH approximately $0.5&nbsp;million for maintenance services, chartered aircraft and
equipment. We made no payments to DDH during fiscal years 2005 and 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, we purchased approximately $9.0&nbsp;million, $6.4&nbsp;million and
$6.8&nbsp;million, respectively, of office products and printing services from Prestige Business
Solutions, Inc., a supplier owned by our Chairman&#146;s daughter-in-law. These products and services
were purchased on a competitive bid basis in substantially all cases. We believe this relationship
has allowed us to obtain these products and services at quality levels and costs more favorable
than would have been available through alternative market sources.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in October&nbsp;2002. The
subpoena was issued in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the Antitrust Division of the
U.S. Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;). The inquiry concerns certain IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery &#151;
Indefinite Quantity) procurements and their related task orders, which occurred in the late 1990s
at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts. Our revenue from the contracts that we believe to be
the focus of the DOJ&#146;s inquiry was approximately $17.2&nbsp;million for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30,
2004, representing approximately 0.4% of our revenue for fiscal year 2004. In February&nbsp;2004, we
sold the contracts associated with the Hanscom Air Force Base relationship to ManTech International
Corporation; however, we have agreed to indemnify ManTech with respect to this DOJ investigation.
The DOJ is continuing its investigation, but we have no information as to when the DOJ will
conclude this
process. We have cooperated with the DOJ in producing documents in response to the subpoena, and
our internal investigation and review of this matter through outside legal counsel will continue
through the conclusion of the DOJ investigatory process. We are unable to express an opinion as to
the likely outcome of this matter at this time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Another of our subsidiaries, ACS State &#038; Local Solutions, Inc. (&#147;ACS SLS&#148;), and a teaming partner
of this subsidiary, Tier Technologies, Inc. (&#147;Tier&#148;), received a grand jury document subpoena
issued by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in May&nbsp;2003. The subpoena
was issued in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. We
believe that the inquiry concerns the teaming arrangements between ACS SLS and Tier on child
support payment processing contracts awarded to ACS SLS, and Tier as a subcontractor to ACS SLS, in
New York, Illinois and Ohio but may also extend to the conduct of ACS SLS and Tier with respect to
the bidding process for child support contracts in certain other states. Effective June&nbsp;30, 2004,
Tier was no longer a subcontractor to us in Ohio. Our revenue from the contracts for which Tier
was a subcontractor was approximately $43.5&nbsp;million, $67&nbsp;million and $40.6&nbsp;million in fiscal years
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing approximately 1%,
1.6% and 1.1% of our fiscal years
2005, 2004 and 2003 revenues, respectively. Our teaming arrangement with Tier also contemplated the
California child support payment processing request for proposals, which was issued in late 2003;
however, we did not enter into a teaming agreement with Tier for the California request for
proposals. Based on Tier&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we understand that
on November&nbsp;20, 2003 the DOJ granted conditional amnesty to Tier in connection with this inquiry
pursuant to the DOJ&#146;s Corporate Leniency Policy. The policy provides that the DOJ will not bring
any criminal charges against Tier as long as it continues to fully cooperate in the inquiry (and
makes restitution payments if it is determined that parties were injured as a result of
impermissible anticompetitive conduct). The DOJ is continuing its investigation, but we have no
information as to when the DOJ will conclude this process. We have cooperated with the DOJ in
producing documents in response to the subpoena, and our internal investigation and review of this
matter through outside legal counsel will continue through the conclusion of the DOJ investigatory
process. We are unable to express an opinion as to the likely outcome of this matter at this time.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;30, 2004, the Florida Agency for Workforce Innovation&#146;s (&#147;AWI&#148;) Office of Inspector
General (&#147;OIG&#148;) issued a report that reviewed 13 Florida workforce regions, including Dade and
Monroe counties, and noted concerns related to the accuracy of customer case records maintained by
our local staff. Our total revenue generated from the Florida workforce services amounts to
approximately 0.9%, 1% and 1.3% of our total fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 revenues,
respectively. In March&nbsp;2004, we filed our response to the OIG report. The principal workforce
policy organization for the State of Florida, which oversees and monitors the administration of the
State&#146;s workforce policy and the programs carried out by AWI and the regional workforce boards, is
Workforce Florida, Inc. (&#147;WFI&#148;). On May&nbsp;20, 2004, the Board of Directors of WFI held a public
meeting at which the Board announced that WFI did not see a systemic problem with our performance
of these workforce services and that it considered the issue closed. There were also certain
contract billing issues that arose during the course of our performance of our workforce contract
in Dade County, Florida, which ended in June&nbsp;2003. However, during the first quarter of fiscal
year 2005, we settled all financial issues with Dade County with respect to our workforce contract
with that county and the settlement is fully reflected in our results of operations for the first
quarter of fiscal year 2005. We were also advised in February&nbsp;2004 that the SEC had initiated an
informal investigation into the matters covered by the OIG&#146;s report, although we have not received
any request for information or documents since the middle of calendar year 2004. On March&nbsp;22,
2004, ACS SLS received a grand jury document subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida. The subpoena was issued in connection with an inquiry being
conducted by the DOJ and the Inspector General&#146;s Office of the U.S. Department of Labor (&#147;DOL&#148;)
into the subsidiary&#146;s workforce contracts in Dade and Monroe counties in Florida, which also
expired in June&nbsp;2003, and which were included in the OIG&#146;s report. On August&nbsp;11, 2005, the South
Florida Workforce Board notified us that all deficiencies in our Dade County workforce contract
have been appropriately addressed and all findings are considered resolved. On August&nbsp;25, 2004, ACS
SLS received a grand jury document subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court for the Middle
District of Florida in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the DOJ and the Inspector
General&#146;s Office of the DOL. The subpoena relates to a workforce contract in Pinellas County in
Florida for the period from January&nbsp;1999 to the contract&#146;s expiration in March&nbsp;2001, which was
prior to our acquisition of this business from Lockheed Martin Corporation in August&nbsp;2001.
Further, we settled a civil lawsuit with Pinellas County in December&nbsp;2003 with respect to claims
related to the services rendered to Pinellas County by Lockheed

ACS SLS as part of the acquisition), and the settlement resulted in Pinellas County paying ACS SLS
an additional $600,000. We are continuing our internal investigation of these matters through
outside legal counsel and we are continuing to cooperate with the DOJ, the SEC and DOL to produce
documents in connection with their investigations. At this stage of these investigations, we are

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;16, 1998, a state district court in Houston, Texas entered final judgment against us in
a lawsuit brought by 21 former employees of Gibraltar Savings Association and/or First Texas
Savings Association (collectively, &#147;GSA/FTSA&#148;). The GSA/FTSA employees alleged that they were
entitled to the value of 803,082 shares of our stock (adjusted for February&nbsp;2002
stock split) pursuant to options issued to the GSA/FTSA employees in 1988 in connection with a
former technology outsourcing services agreement between GSA/FTSA and us. The judgment against us
was for approximately $17&nbsp;million, which included attorneys&#146; fees and pre-judgment interest. The
judgment was appealed by the plaintiffs and us and the appellate process has now been concluded.
As a result of the appeals, the trial court&#146;s judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to
the trial court for further proceedings, except that the trial court judgment was affirmed in part
as to one of the plaintiffs and the trial court&#146;s dismissal of certain of our affirmative defenses
was upheld. The amount of the judgment for the one plaintiff whose judgment was upheld has been
settled for $1.3&nbsp;million. In August&nbsp;2004, mediation was conducted which resulted in the settlement
of claims of the other GSA/FTSA employees. As a result of this settlement, we accrued $10&nbsp;million
in other operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 related to this settlement
and paid $10&nbsp;million in full settlement of all claims of the other GSA/FTSA employees in August
2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Note 9, certain contracts, primarily in our Government segment, require us to
provide a surety bond or a letter of credit as a guarantee of performance. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005,
outstanding surety bonds of $269.2&nbsp;million and $84.9&nbsp;million of our outstanding letters of credit
secure our performance of contractual obligations with our clients. In general, we would only be
liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance of our
obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. Approximately $16
million of letters of credit secure our casualty insurance
and vendor programs. We believe that we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and
liquidity from our cash flow and our Credit Facility to respond to future requests for proposals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are obligated to make certain contingent payments to former shareholders of acquired entities
upon satisfaction of certain contractual criteria in conjunction with certain acquisitions. During
fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 we made contingent consideration payments of $17&nbsp;million, $10.4
million and $8&nbsp;million, respectively, related to acquisitions completed in prior years. As of June
30, 2005, the maximum aggregate amount of the outstanding contingent obligations to former
shareholders of acquired entities is approximately $45.5&nbsp;million, of which $6.3&nbsp;million has been
earned as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. The $6.3&nbsp;million was accrued as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and is expected to be
paid during the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Any such payments primarily result in a
corresponding increase in goodwill.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have indemnified Lockheed Martin Corporation against certain specified claims from certain
pre-sale litigation, investigations, government audits and other issues related to the sale of the
majority of our Federal business to Lockheed Martin Corporation in fiscal year 2004. Our maximum
exposure under these indemnifications is $85&nbsp;million; however, we believe the actual exposure to be
significantly less. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, other accrued liabilities include a reserve for these
claims in an amount we believe to be adequate at this time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our Education Services business, which is included in our Commercial segment, performs third party
student loan servicing in the Federal Family Education Loan program (&#147;FFEL&#148;) on behalf of various
financial institutions. We service these loans for investors under outsourcing arrangements and do
not acquire any servicing rights that are transferable by us to a third party. At June&nbsp;30, 2005,
we serviced a FFEL portfolio of approximately 1.6&nbsp;million loans with an outstanding principal
balance of approximately $21.2&nbsp;billion. Some servicing agreements contain provisions that, under
certain circumstances, require us to purchase the loans from the investor if the loan guaranty has
been permanently terminated as a result of a loan default caused by our servicing error. If
defaults caused by us are cured during an initial period, any obligation we may have to purchase
these loans expires. Loans that we purchase may be subsequently cured, the guaranty reinstated and
then we repackage the loans for sale to third parties. We evaluate our exposure under our purchase
obligations on defaulted loans and establish a reserve for potential losses, or default liability
reserve, through a charge to the provision for loss on defaulted loans purchased. The reserve is
evaluated periodically and adjusted based upon management&#146;s analysis of the historical performance
of the defaulted loans. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, other accrued liabilities include reserves
which we believe to be adequate.

</DIV>


<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2004, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (&#147;MDEQ&#148;) issued a Notice of
Violation to ACS Image Solutions, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, that alleged noncompliance with
the Clean Water Act and the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. On September&nbsp;20, 2004,
we agreed to settle this matter with the MDEQ for $150,000. We have closed the specific operation
whose activities resulted in this notice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2004, we were awarded a contract by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human
Services (&#147;DHHS&#148;) to replace and operate the North Carolina Medicaid Management Information System
(&#147;NCMMIS&#148;). Prior to DHHS&#146; award of the contract, our proposal was reviewed and approved by the
State of North Carolina&#146;s Information Technology Services group and the Federal Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services. Two competitors protested the contract award. In considering the protests,
DHHS again reviewed our proposal and determined that our technical solutions did, in fact, comply
with all technical requirements and denied the protests on June&nbsp;3, 2004. EDS protested the denial.
On January&nbsp;12, 2005, an administrative law
judge made a non-binding recommendation to sustain EDS&#146; protest of the contract between us and the
DHHS. Notwithstanding the reviews, approvals, and decisions in awarding the contract and in
considering the protests, the administrative law judge based his recommendation on his assessment
that our technical solution did not fully comply with the DHHS technical standards for proposals.
The non-binding recommendation was issued to the North Carolina State Chief Information Officer
(&#147;CIO&#148;), Office of Technology Services. We, DHHS and EDS each presented written arguments to the
CIO. A hearing was held before the CIO on March&nbsp;15, 2005 during which each of the parties
presented oral arguments. On April&nbsp;28, 2005, the CIO issued a decision in favor of the DHHS and us
as to the issues of: (i)&nbsp;the sufficiency of our technical solution, (ii)&nbsp;our satisfaction of RFP
requirements relative to our integrated testing facility, and (iii)&nbsp;whether the State&#146;s evaluation
was consistent with the RFP&#146;s evaluation criteria. However, his ruling also found insufficient
evidence or argument had been submitted to address three other issues raised by EDS in its initial
protest filing. Therefore, the CIO has directed that a hearing be conducted on the issues of
whether (a)&nbsp;our proposal complied with RFP requirements relative to experience of proposed key
personnel; (b)&nbsp;our proposal complied with RFP requirements for pricing; and (c)&nbsp;any perceived price
advantage is illusory and in any event was miscalculated by DHHS. EDS subsequently waived its
right to a hearing before the CIO on these three remaining issues and on May&nbsp;18, 2005, EDS appealed
the CIO&#146;s decision to Wake County Superior Court. It is anticipated that a hearing will be held in
October&nbsp;2005. We intend to vigorously pursue affirmation of DHHS&#146; contract award. DHHS has
instructed us to continue performance of our services under the contract.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to certain other legal proceedings, inquiries, claims
and disputes, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict the
outcomes of these other proceedings, we do not believe these other actions, in the aggregate, will
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>18. GEORGIA CONTRACT</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2001, we were awarded a contract by the Georgia Department of Community Health (&#147;DCH&#148;) to
develop, implement and operate a system to administer health benefits to Georgia Medicaid
recipients as well as state government employees (the &#147;Georgia Contract&#148;). This system development
project was large and complex and anticipated the development of a system that would process both
Medicaid and state employee claims. The Medicaid phase of this project was implemented on April&nbsp;1,
2003. Various disputes arose because of certain delays and operational issues that were encountered
in this phase. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, in connection with a settlement in
principle, we recorded a $6.7&nbsp;million reduction in revenue resulting from the change in our
percentage-of-completion estimates primarily as a result of the termination of Phase II of the
contract, a charge of $2.6&nbsp;million to services and supplies associated with the accrual of
wind-down costs associated with the termination of Phase II and an accrual of $10&nbsp;million in other
operating expenses to be paid to DCH pursuant to the settlement which was paid in the first quarter
of fiscal year 2005. On July&nbsp;21, 2004, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement with the
DCH to settle these disputes. The terms of the definitive settlement, which were substantially the
same as those announced in January&nbsp;2004, include the $10&nbsp;million payment by us to DCH; a payment by
DCH to us of $9&nbsp;million in system development costs; escrow of $11.8&nbsp;million paid by DCH, with $2.4
million of the escrowed funds to be paid to us upon completion of an agreed work plan ticket and
reprocessing of July&nbsp;2003 &#151; June&nbsp;2004 claims, and the remaining $9.4&nbsp;million of escrowed funds to
be paid to us upon final certification of the system by the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services
(&#147;CMS&#148;), the governing Federal regulatory agency; cancellation of Phase II of the contract; and an
agreement to settle outstanding operational invoices resulting in a payment to us of over $8.2
million and approximately $7&nbsp;million of reduction in such invoices. In April&nbsp;2005, CMS certified
the system effective as of August&nbsp;1, 2003. DCH has requested funding level information from CMS
for the period from the system implementation date, April&nbsp;1, 2003, through July&nbsp;31, 2003. We will
begin discussions with DCH regarding distribution of the $9.4&nbsp;million in escrow funds related to
system certification when DCH receives the relevant information from CMS. Our work related to the
remaining $2.4&nbsp;million in escrow is continuing.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are organized into Commercial and Government segments due to the different operating
environments of each segment, caused by different types of clients, differing economic
characteristics, and the nature of regulatory environments. In the Commercial segment, we provide
business process outsourcing, information technology outsourcing, and systems integration services
to clients including healthcare providers and payors, pharmaceutical and other manufacturers,
retailers, wholesale distributors, utilities, entertainment, higher education institutions,
financial institutions, insurance and transportation companies. In the Government segment, we
provide business process outsourcing, information technology
outsourcing and systems integration services to state and local
governments. Our Government segment also includes our relationship with the United States
Department of Education (the &#147;Department of Education&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In fiscal year 2003, we reported our results of
operations in three segments: Commercial, State
and Local Government, and Federal. In fiscal year 2004, as a result of the sale of our Divested
Federal Business, we combined our State and Local Government and Federal segments into our
Government Segment. Prior period reporting has been restated to conform to the new segment
reporting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Over 97% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 were derived from
domestic clients. Our relationship with the Department of Education is our largest contract and
represents approximately 5%, 5% and 4% of consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. Other than the Department of Education, no single customer exceeded 5% of our
revenues.

Federal Business. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a pretax gain of $284.3
million ($181.7&nbsp;million, net of income tax) in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. We
recognized additional pretax gains of $0.5&nbsp;million ($0.3&nbsp;million, net of income tax) and
$0.4&nbsp;million ($0.3&nbsp;million, net of income tax) in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal
year 2004, respectively, primarily due to our final working capital settlement with

affected by SFAS 123(R), including share-based payment transactions with non-employees, valuation
methods, accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share-based payment
arrangements, the classification of compensation expense, non-GAAP financial measures,
capitalization of compensation cost related to share-based payment arrangements, the accounting for
income tax effects of share-based payment arrangements upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the
modification of employee share options prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and disclosures in

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;22, 2004, the President signed into law the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. FASB Staff Position 109-2 &#147;Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for
the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004&#148; allows
companies additional time beyond that provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109 &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes&#148; to determine the impact of the Act on its financial statements
and provides guidance for the disclosure of the impact of the Act on the financial statements. At
June&nbsp;30, 2005, cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries for which U.S. taxes have
not been recorded totaled $36.5&nbsp;million, the tax effects on which, if repatriated, cannot be
reasonably estimated at this time. We are currently considering repatriation of amounts up to and
including $36.5&nbsp;million, pending completion of our analysis. This incentive is available to us
until June&nbsp;30, 2006. The 85% dividends received deduction is subject to a number of limitations,
and we have not yet decided whether, or to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that
have not yet been remitted to the U.S. We will continue to monitor our international activities
and expect to reach a decision regarding repatriation prior to the expiration of this incentive.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2005, we acquired LiveBridge, Inc., a customer care service provider primarily serving the
financial and telecommunications industries, for approximately $32&nbsp;million plus contingent
consideration of up to $32&nbsp;million based upon future financial performance. The acquisition was
funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Facility. We believe this acquisition
will expand our customer care operations and extend our global customer interaction service
capabilities to include Canada and Argentina.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2005, we announced an agreement to acquire the Transport Revenue division of Ascom AG, a
Switzerland-based communications company (&#147;Transport Revenue&#148;), for approximately $100&nbsp;million.
The acquisition will be funded through borrowings on our Credit Facility. Transport Revenue
consists of three business units: transit, parking and toll collection with offices across nine
countries. We believe this acquisition will expand our portfolio in the transit and parking
payment markets and the international transportation services industry. Transport Revenue will
also add toll collection clients to our existing customer base. As a result of international
regulatory and local approvals, this transaction is not expected to close until the second quarter
of fiscal year 2006.

officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. Based on such

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in May&nbsp;2005, we acquired the human
resources consulting and outsourcing businesses of Mellon Financial Corporation (the &#147;Acquired HR
Business&#148;). We have excluded the Acquired HR Business from the scope of our assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. The Acquired HR Business&#146; total
revenues and total assets represent 2.4% and 13.3%, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
June&nbsp;30, 2005 using the criteria set forth in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission<I>. </I>Based on this evaluation,
management has concluded that, as of June&nbsp;30, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting
was effective.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
June&nbsp;30, 2005, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm who also audited our consolidated financial statements. Their report appears under
