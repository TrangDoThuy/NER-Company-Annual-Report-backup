</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are a leading provider of business process outsourcing, information technology services and
system integration services to government agencies. Approximately 40% of our fiscal year 2007
consolidated revenues were derived from contracts with government clients. Our Government segment
includes our relationship with the Department of Education, for which we service federal student
loans, including their Direct Student Loan program, and which represents approximately 4% of our
fiscal year 2007 consolidated revenues. Our services help government agencies reduce operating
costs, increase revenue streams and increase the quality of services to citizens. Government
clients may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause, for convenience or lack
of funding. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations
by government agencies. If the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract,
the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the
government.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pricing for our services in the government market is generally determined based on the number of

development project is required, on a fixed fee basis for the development work.

Federal Business&#148;), we entered into a five-year non-competition agreement with Lockheed Martin
Corporation that generally prohibits us from offering services or products that were previously
provided by the Divested Federal Business. This non-competition agreement does not prohibit us
from entering into the federal government market for services not previously provided by the
Divested Federal Business, such as certain federal healthcare market services, nor does it restrict
us from expanding our relationship with the Department of Education.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our largest contract is with the Department of Education. We have provided loan servicing for the
Department of Education&#146;s (the &#147;Department&#148;) Direct Student Loan program for over ten years. In
2003, the Department conducted a competitive procurement for its &#147;Common Services for Borrowers&#148;
initiative (&#147;CSB&#148;). CSB was a modernization initiative which integrated a number of student loan
processing services for the Department, allowing the Department to increase loan servicing quality
while saving overall program costs. In November&nbsp;2003, the Department awarded us the CSB contract.
Under this contract we provide comprehensive loan servicing, consolidation loan processing, debt
collection services on delinquent accounts, IT infrastructure operations and support, maintenance
and development of information systems, and portfolio management services for the Department of
Education&#146;s Direct Student Loan program. The CSB contract has a 5-year base term which began in
January&nbsp;2004 and provides the Department of Education five one-year options to extend after the
base
term. We estimate that our revenues from the CSB contract will exceed $1&nbsp;billion in total over the
base term of the contract.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We achieve growth in our client base through marketing our business process outsourcing,
information technology and system integration services and acquiring companies that allow us to
expand our service offerings. Within the Commercial segment, we serve the major vertical markets
that spend heavily on technology including healthcare providers and payors, manufacturers,
retailers, wholesale distributors, utilities, entertainment companies, higher education
institutions, financial institutions, insurance and transportation companies. Within the
Government segment, our clients include a wide variety of federal, state and local governments and
agencies including the U.S. Department of Education. Our business with government clients is
subject to various risks, including the reduction or modification of contracts due to changing
government needs and requirements. We may lose clients due to mergers, business failures, or
clients&#146; conversion to a competing processor or to an in-house system. Government contracts, by
their terms, generally can be terminated for convenience by the government, which means that the
government may terminate the contract at any time, without cause. Please refer to Item&nbsp;1A. Risk
Factors for further discussion of the risks related to our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our five largest clients accounted for approximately 13%, 13% and 15% of our fiscal years 2007,
2006 and 2005 revenues, respectively. Our largest client, the Department of Education, represented
approximately 4%, 4% and 5% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

respectively, were derived from domestic clients. As of both June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, approximately
92% of our long-lived assets were located in the United States. Of our long-lived assets located
outside the United States, the largest concentration is in France, with approximately 2% of our
total long-lived assets as of both June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006. Please see Item&nbsp;1A. Risk Factors for a

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The markets for our services are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. We believe our
competitive advantage comes from our use of world-class technology, subject matter expertise,
process reengineering skills, proprietary software, our global production model, activity-based
compensation and the price of services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We compete in the commercial market by offering value added business process outsourcing,
information technology and system integration services. The competition for our commercial
outsourcing services is primarily the in-house departments performing the function we are seeking
to outsource, as well as Accenture, Computer Sciences Corporation, Electronic Data Systems
Corporation (&#147;EDS&#148;), Hewitt Associates, International Business Machines (&#147;IBM&#148;), Perot Systems,
and, to a lesser extent, Indian service providers. We may be required to purchase technology
assets from prospective clients or to provide financial assistance to prospective clients in order
to obtain their contracts. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and thus,
may have a greater ability to obtain client contracts where sizable asset purchases, investments or
financing support are required.

Brazil are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Employment arrangements for our
international employees are often governed by works or labor council arrangements. We have had no
work stoppages or strikes by our employees. Management considers its relations with employees and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The risks described below should not be considered to be comprehensive and all-inclusive.
Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also
impair our business operations. If any events occur that give rise to the following risks, our
business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected, and as a result, the trading price of our Class&nbsp;A common stock could be materially and
adversely impacted. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with other information set
forth in this report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>We have issued debt and have a substantial uncommitted facility available to us. Our debt service

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, we have outstanding approximately $500&nbsp;million of Senior Notes (defined in

in Item&nbsp;7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150;
Liquidity and Capital Resources &#150; <I>Senior Notes</I>). The Credit Facility provides for a senior secured
term loan facility of $1.8&nbsp;billion, with the ability to increase it by up to $2&nbsp;billion (as of June
30, 2007), under certain circumstances (the &#147;Term Loan Facility&#148;) and a senior secured revolving
credit facility of $1&nbsp;billion with the ability to increase it by up to $750&nbsp;million (the &#147;Revolving
Facility&#148;). Substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure our Credit Facility and our
Senior Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If we are fully drawn under our Credit Facility (including the increase resulting from the
accordion features of the Revolving Facility), the book value of our equity may be in a deficit
position. The interest rates under the Credit Facility fluctuate with changes in the market rates
and with changes in our leverage ratio. Thus, our debt service cost will increase as market
interest rates increase and as our leverage ratio increases. It will be necessary to utilize cash
flow from operating activities to fund debt service cost related to our indebtedness. If we fail to
have sufficient cash flow to satisfy the debt service cost of our indebtedness, then we could
default on our indebtedness, resulting in foreclosure on the assets used to conduct our business.
In addition, reduction of our available cash flow may negatively impact our business, including our
ability to make future acquisitions, ability to compete for customer contracts requiring upfront
capital costs, and our ability to meet our other obligations. Further, the amount of our
indebtedness and our reduction in available cash flow may limit our ability to obtain further debt
or equity financing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Alleged defaults and purported acceleration of our Senior Notes, if upheld in litigation, could
have a negative impact on our cash flow and divert resources that could otherwise be utilized in
our business operations.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain holders of our Senior Notes have alleged that we have defaulted under our Senior Notes and
have accelerated payment of the principal and accrued interest on the Senior Notes. We have taken
the position that no default and no acceleration has occurred with respect to the Senior Notes or
otherwise under the Indenture dated June&nbsp;6, 2005 (the &#147;Indenture&#148;) between us and The Bank of New
York Trust Company, N.A., which has been subsequently replaced as Trustee by Wilmington Trust
Company (the &#147;Trustee&#148;), and filed a lawsuit against the Trustee in the United States District
Court, Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, seeking a declaratory judgment affirming our
position. There can be no assurance of the outcome of that lawsuit. If a final judgment is rendered
that there has been a default and acceleration has occurred, then we may have to pay the principal
and accrued interest under the Senior Notes. While we do have availability under our Credit
Facility to draw funds to repay the Senior Notes, there may be a decrease in our credit
availability that could otherwise be used for other corporate purposes, such as acquisitions and
share repurchases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>The complexity of regulatory environments in which we operate has increased and may continue to
increase our costs.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure, accounting
and tax requirements and environmental legislation that have increased both our costs and the risk
of noncompliance. Because our Class&nbsp;A common stock and Senior Notes are publicly traded, we are
subject to certain rules and regulations for federal, state and financial market exchange entities
(including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the NYSE). We have
implemented new policies and procedures and continue developing additional policies and procedures
in response to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, we have made a significant effort to comply with the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including, among other things the development of policies and
procedures to satisfy the provisions thereof regarding internal control over financial reporting,
disclosure controls and procedures and certification of financial statements appearing in periodic
reports) and the formation of a compliance department to develop policies and monitor compliance
with laws (including, among others, privacy laws, export control laws, rules and regulations of the
Office of Foreign Asset Controls and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). Our effort to comply with
these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general
and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating
activities to compliance activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>We are subject to the oversight of the SEC and other regulatory agencies and investigations by
those agencies could divert management&#146;s focus and could have a material adverse impact on our
reputation and financial condition.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of this regulation and oversight, we may be subject to legal and administrative
proceedings. We are currently the subject of an ongoing SEC and Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;)
investigation related to our historical stock option grant practices. As a result of these
investigations, several derivative lawsuits have been filed in connection with our stock option

ratings could negatively impact our ability to renew contracts with our existing customers, limit
our ability to compete for new customers, result in increased premiums for surety bonds to support
our customer contracts, and/or result in a requirement that we provide collateral to secure our

investments to perform the agreement, such as purchases of information technology equipment and
costs incurred to develop and implement software. The net book value of such assets recorded,

Our mix of non-recurring and recurring revenues is impacted by acquisitions as well as growth in
our non-recurring lines of business. There is less predictability and certainty in the timing and

our existing markets. If we are forced to lower our pricing or if demand for our services
decreases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow may be
materially and adversely affected. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources,
and they may be able to use their resources to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies,
to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services, or to obtain
client contracts where sizable asset purchases, investments or financing support are required. In
addition, we must frequently compete with a client&#146;s own internal business process and information
technology capabilities, which may constitute a fixed cost for the client. In the future,
competition could continue to emerge from large computer hardware or software providers as they
shift their business strategy to include services. Competition has also emerged from European and
Indian offshore service providers seeking to expand into our markets and from large consulting
companies seeking operational outsourcing opportunities (please see discussion in Item&nbsp;1, Part&nbsp;1.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have rapidly expanded our operations in recent years. We intend to continue expansion in the
foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities. Some market opportunities
require that we develop software to perform the services we become contractually obligated to
perform, such as our Medicaid activities. This rapid growth places a significant demand on our
management and operational resources. In order to manage growth effectively, we must design,
develop, implement and improve our operational systems, which includes the design, development and
implementation of software, if necessary, and timely development and implementation of procedures
and controls. If we fail to design, develop and implement these systems and to make improvements to
these systems, we may not be able to service our clients&#146; needs, hire and retain new employees,
pursue new business opportunities, complete future acquisitions or operate our businesses
effectively. We could also trigger contractual credits to clients or a contractual default. Failure
to properly transition new clients to our systems, properly budget transition costs or accurately
estimate new contract operational costs could result in delays in our contract performance, trigger
service level penalties, impairments of fixed or intangible assets or result in contracts whose
profit margins did not meet our expectations or our historical profit margins. Failure to properly
integrate acquired operations could result in increased cost. As a result of any of these problems
associated with expansion, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow
could be materially and adversely affected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Approximately 40% of our fiscal year 2007 revenues were derived from contracts with state and local
governments and from federal government agencies, including our contract with the Department of
Education. Governments and their agencies may terminate most of these contracts at any time,
without cause. Also, our Department of Education contract is subject to the approval of
appropriations being made by the United States Congress to fund the expenditures to be made by the
federal government under this contract. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to
audits and investigations by government agencies. If the government finds that we improperly
charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost
must be refunded to the government. If the government discovers improper or illegal activities in
the course of audits or investigations, the contractor may be subject to various civil and criminal
penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of
profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the
government. Any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Further, the negative publicity
that arises from findings in such audits, investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore
could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete
for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">After an award of a government contract, a competing bidder may protest the award. If we are
awarded the contract and it is protested, it will be necessary to incur costs to defend the award
of the contract. Costs to defend an award may be significant and could include hiring experts to
defend the basis for the contract award. Some contract protests may take years to resolve. In some
instances where we are awarded a contract, the contracting government entity may request that we
sign a contract and commence services, even though the contract award has been protested. If the
protest is upheld, then our contract would be terminated and the amounts due to us for services
that have been performed to date would be subject to payment pursuant to the terms of the
terminated contract. Such terms may not provide for full recovery of our incurred costs. In
addition, if the government agency requests that we make changes to our contractual agreement
during a protest period, but the government agency is unable or unwilling to modify the contract at
the end of the protest period (whether or not we are successful in defending the protest), we may
be unable to recover the full costs incurred in making such changes. In addition, we may suffer
negative publicity as the result of any contract protest being upheld and our contract being
terminated. Further, if there is a re-bid of the contract, we would incur additional costs associated with the re-bid process and be
subject to a potential protest if we are awarded a subsequent contract.

some of which have resulted in litigation and significant settlements or judgments, particularly
when investment markets have performed poorly and pension funding levels have been adversely

current and former employees if transactions are not properly processed. If any claim is made

that we use to run our business; instead we license this software from a small number of primary
vendors. If these vendors assert claims that we or our clients are infringing on their software or
related intellectual property, we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims, which could
have a material effect on our profitability and cash flow. In addition, if any of our vendors&#146;
infringement claims are ultimately successful, our vendors could require us (1)&nbsp;to cease selling or
using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology, (2)&nbsp;to obtain a
license or additional licenses from our vendors, or (3)&nbsp;to redesign our products and services which
rely on the challenged software or technology. If we are unsuccessful in the defense of an

individually identifiable information, including social security numbers, financial and health
information. For example, in 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act and as required therein, the Department of Health and Human Services established
regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of
individually identifiable health information. We have taken measures to comply with each of those
regulations on or before the required dates. Another example is the European Union Directive on

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, we have approximately 325 locations in the United States, of which 183
locations are occupied by Commercial operations, 141 locations are occupied by Government
operations, and our company-owned facility in Dallas, Texas, which is occupied by primarily
Commercial and Corporate functions. We also have 97 locations in 27 other countries, of which 59
locations are occupied by Commercial operations and 38 locations are occupied by Government
operations. In addition, we also have employees in client-owned locations. We own approximately
1.2&nbsp;million square feet of real estate space and lease approximately 8.7&nbsp;million square feet. The
leases expire from calendar years 2007 to 2018 and we do not anticipate any significant difficulty
in obtaining lease renewals or alternate space. Our executive offices are located in Dallas, Texas
at a company-owned facility of approximately 630,000 square feet, which also houses a host data
center and other operations. We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate for
our current business.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), we are allowed to pay
cash dividends. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board
of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual
restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and such other factors as the Board of
Directors deems relevant. We intend to retain earnings for use in the operation of our business
and, therefore, did not pay cash dividends in the fiscal years ended June&nbsp;30, 2007, 2006 and 2005

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We derive our revenues from delivering comprehensive business process outsourcing and information
technology services solutions to commercial and government clients. A substantial portion of our
revenues is derived from recurring monthly charges to our clients under service contracts with
initial terms that vary from one to ten years. We define recurring revenues as revenues derived
from services that our clients use each year in connection with their ongoing businesses, and
accordingly, exclude software license fees, short-term contract programming and consulting
engagements, product installation fees, and hardware and software sales. However, as we add,
through acquisitions or new service offerings, consulting or other services to enhance the value
delivered and offered to our clients, which are primarily short-term in nature, we may experience
variations in our mix of recurring versus non-recurring revenues. Since inception, our acquisition
program has resulted in growth and diversification of our client base, expansion of services and
products offered, increased economies of scale and geographic expansion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management focuses on various metrics in analyzing our business and its performance and outlook.
One such metric is our sales pipeline, which was approximately $1.7&nbsp;billion of annual recurring
revenues as of June&nbsp;30, 2007. Our sales pipeline is a qualified pipeline of deals with signings
anticipated within the next six months and excludes deals with annual recurring revenue over $100
million. Both the commercial and government pipelines have significant, quality opportunities
across multiple lines of business and in multiple vertical markets, including opportunities in
business process outsourcing, human resources outsourcing, commercial and government healthcare and
transportation services, including international opportunities, commercial and government
information technology services and federal government services. We analyze the cash flow
generation qualities of each deal in our pipeline and make decisions based on its cash return
characteristics. While the magnitude of our sales pipeline is an important indicator of potential
new business signings and potential future internal revenue growth, actual new business signings
and internal revenue growth depend on a number of factors including the effectiveness of our sales
pursuit teams, competition for a deal, deal pricing and other risks described further in Item&nbsp;1A.
Risk Factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We use internal revenue growth as a measure of the organic growth of our business. Internal revenue
growth is measured as total revenue growth less acquired revenue from acquisitions and revenues
from divested operations. At the date of acquisition, we identify the trailing twelve months of
revenue of the acquired company as the &#147;pre-acquisition revenue of acquired companies.&#148;
Pre-acquisition revenue of the acquired companies is considered &#147;acquired revenues&#148; in our
calculation, and revenues from the acquired company, either above or below that amount are
components of &#147;internal growth&#148; in our calculation. We use the calculation of internal revenue
growth to measure revenue growth excluding the impact of acquired revenues and the revenue
associated with divested operations and we believe these adjustments to historical reported results
are necessary to accurately reflect our internal revenue growth. Revenues from divested operations
are excluded from the internal revenue growth calculation in the periods following the effective
date of the divestiture. Prior period internal revenue growth calculations are not restated for
current period divestitures. Our measure of internal revenue growth may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures of other companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management analyzes new business signings on a trailing twelve month basis as it is generally a
better indicator of future growth than quarterly new business signings which can vary due to timing
of contract execution. We define new business signings as annual recurring revenue from new
contracts, including the incremental portion of renewals, signed during the period and represent
the estimated first twelve months of revenue to be recorded under that contract after full
implementation. We use new business signings as additional measures of estimating total revenue
represented by contractual commitments, both to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate
capital commitments. Revenues for new business signings are measured under GAAP. There are no
third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of new business signings and our
measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. During fiscal year
2007 we signed approximately $607&nbsp;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">million of annual recurring revenue and estimated total contract
value of $2.8&nbsp;billion. We define total contract value as the estimated total revenues from
contracts signed during the period and represents estimated total revenue over the term of the
contract. We use total contract value as an additional measure of estimating total revenue
represented by contractual
commitments, both to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate capital commitments. Revenues
for annual recurring revenue and total contract value are measured under GAAP.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Renewal rates are a key indicator of client satisfaction. We calculate our renewal rate based on
the total annual recurring revenue of renewals won as a percentage of total annual recurring
revenue of all renewals sought. During fiscal year 2007, we renewed approximately 94% of total
renewals sought totaling approximately $869&nbsp;million of annual recurring revenue with a
total contract value of approximately $2.4&nbsp;billion. Average contract life for renewals typically
varies between our government and commercial segments, with the average contract life of renewals
in the government segment often shorter than those in the commercial segment. While we track
renewal rates on a quarterly basis, we believe it is appropriate to analyze our renewal rates on an
annual basis due to the timing of renewal opportunities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We compete for new business in the competitive information technology services and business process
outsourcing markets. The overall health of these markets and the competitive environment can be
determined by analyzing several key metrics. One such metric is the overall expected operating
margin of our new business signings which is a good indicator of our expected future operating
margin given the long-term nature of our customer contracts. We are seeing that the overall
expected operating margin of new business signings is consistent with our historical operating
margin. We focus on the expected operating margins of the new business we are signing to ensure
the operating margins we expect to generate are commensurate with the capital intensity of the new
business opportunity, the risk profile of the services we are providing and the overall return on
capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We monitor the capital intensity, defined as capital expenditures and additions to intangible
assets, of new business signings. Understanding the capital intensity of new business signings is
helpful in determining the future free cash flow generating levels of our business. Historically,
the capital intensity in our business has ranged between 5 to 7%. During fiscal year 2007, the
overall capital intensity of our business was approximately 6%. During fiscal year 2006, the
overall capital intensity of our business was 8% due to approximately $60&nbsp;million in investments
that we made in certain areas of our business. These investments included investments related to
integrating the Acquired HR Business (defined below) and expanding our human resources outsourcing
technology platform; investments made in our Government healthcare technology platforms; the
expansion of our data center capacity with the addition of a new data center and investments to
increase global production both in existing locations and new geographies. The expected capital
intensity of new business signings during fiscal year 2007 was consistent with our
historical range. We believe the expected capital intensity range of our new business signings
reflects a healthy competitive environment and the related risks we are taking with respect to our
new business process outsourcing business and information technology services business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Retaining and training our employees is a key ingredient to our historical success and will
continue to be a major factor in our future success. We consistently review our employee retention
rates on a regional and global basis to ensure that we are competitive in hiring, retaining and
motivating our employees. We perform benchmarking studies against some markets in which we compete
to ensure our competitiveness in compensation and benefits and utilize employee surveys to gauge
our employees&#146; level of satisfaction. We provide our employees ongoing technological, management,
financial and leadership training and will continue to do so to develop our employees and remain
competitive. We utilize activity based compensation as a means to motivate certain of our
employees in both segments of our business and anticipate increasing our use of activity based
compensation in fiscal year 2008. We believe our use of activity based compensation is a
competitive advantage for ACS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>2008 Outlook</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a premier provider of business process outsourcing and information technology services, we
believe we are well positioned to benefit from commercial and governmental entities&#146; demand to
outsource non-core, mission-critical back office functions. Demand for commercial business process
and information technology services is expected to remain healthy during fiscal year 2008. However,
we believe that our ability to compete for new business may be impacted by the uncertainty
surrounding our future ownership structure. Areas of strong demand in the Commercial segment
include transactional business process outsourcing, multi-scope human resources outsourcing,
finance and accounting outsourcing, customer care outsourcing and traditional information

the areas that we have marketed historically, such as government healthcare, municipal services,
electronic payment services and transportation services and solutions, we continue to believe that
government entities could benefit from our commercial best practices around such areas as

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">geographic perspective, we believe that there will continue to be strong demand
in the United States and expect to see more business process outsourcing opportunities in Europe
and abroad.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In order to capitalize on opportunities in these markets, we will continue to make certain
investments and reorganizations in our business in fiscal year 2008. During fiscal 2007, we
completed strategic acquisitions in specific segments of our business including
the learning outsourcing component of human resources outsourcing, the cost recovery and credit
balance auditing segments of commercial healthcare markets, information systems consulting and
integration market, and the integrated eligibility market. These acquisitions should allow us to
capitalize on strong demand in these vertical markets. During fiscal year 2006, we performed a
critical review of our operations and restructured certain operations and shed non-core businesses.
We continued our restructuring activities in fiscal year 2007, and recorded certain restructuring
charges and asset impairments arising from our discretionary decisions in that period. We believe
that these restructuring activities will help us better compete in the diverse markets that we
serve.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the Commercial segment, our primary goal for fiscal 2008 is to increase internal revenue growth.
We believe we will be able to accomplish this goal with our existing and future changes to our
organizational structure, deepening our relationships with our clients and utilizing our
operational and process re-engineering skills. We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions to build
upon our existing service capabilities, expand our service offerings and increase our service
innovation. We expect to strengthen our organization by promoting leaders from within the Company
as well as recruiting top industry talent. We also plan to increase our penetration of low-cost
delivery locations outside the United States. In the Government segment, we expect to expand our
innovative solutions and platforms, including our software solutions for the state Medicaid market.
We expect to leverage our existing broad international presence and subject matter expertise in
the transportation services market to markets beyond transportation. We believe we can expand our
existing solutions in the property, public safety and judicial markets for solutions that we can
utilize globally. In both segments, we plan to deepen our use of incentive based compensation.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;3, 2006, we received notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was
conducting an investigation into certain stock option grants made by us from October&nbsp;1998 through
March&nbsp;2005. On June&nbsp;7, 2006 and on June&nbsp;16, 2006, we received requests from the SEC for
information on all of our stock option grants since 1994. We have been providing supplemental
information to the SEC on a voluntary basis following the initial SEC
requests. Subsequent to  May&nbsp;10,
2007, the date of our last quarterly filing with the Commission, the Company has learned that the
SEC obtained a formal order of investigation in this matter in August&nbsp;2006. We are continuing to
cooperate with the SEC&#146;s investigation.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Restructuring Activities</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal year 2006, we began a comprehensive assessment of our operations, including our
overall cost structure, competitive position, technology assets and operating platform and foreign
operations. As a result, we began certain restructuring initiatives and activities that are
expected to enhance our competitive position in certain markets, and recorded certain restructuring
charges and asset impairments arising from our discretionary decisions. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007,
approximately 2,500 employees have been involuntarily terminated as a result of these initiatives,
consisting primarily of offshore processors and related management; however, we anticipate that a
majority of these positions would be migrated to lower cost markets. We anticipate the costs
savings related to these involuntary terminations will be approximately $129&nbsp;million ($97&nbsp;million
related to terminations in fiscal year 2007) of wages and benefits per year; however, some of the
cost savings from these involuntary terminations will be reinvested in subject matter experts,
project management talent and sales personnel as we look to further promote those lines of
businesses that reflect the greatest potential for growth. Our assessment activities are ongoing
and may result in further restructuring and related charges, the amount and timing of which cannot
be determined at this time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our Commercial segment, we began an assessment of the cost structure of our global production
model, particularly our offshore processing activities. We identified offshore locations in which
our labor costs were no longer competitive or where the volume of work processed by the site no
longer justifies retaining the location, including one of our Mexican facilities. In connection
with this assessment, we recorded restructuring charges for involuntary termination of employees
related to the closure of those duplicative facilities or locations of $6.5&nbsp;million and $5.5
million for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is reflected in wages and
benefits in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and $2.4&nbsp;million and $4.7&nbsp;million for the years
ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for impairments of duplicative technology equipment and
facility costs, facility shutdown and other costs, which are reflected as part of total operating
expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We plan to further penetrate offshore labor
markets. We expect these activities will consolidate our global production activities and enhance
our competitive position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our Government segment, we began an assessment of our competitive position, evaluated our market
strategies and the technology used to support certain of our service offerings. We began to
implement operating practices that we utilize in our Commercial segment, including leveraging our
proprietary workflow technology and implementing activity based compensation, which is expected to
reduce our operating costs and enhance our competitive position. In connection with these
activities, we recorded restructuring charges for involuntary termination of employees of $0.7
million and $1&nbsp;million for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is reflected
in wages and benefits in our Consolidated Statements of
Income. In fiscal year 2007, we recorded $0.5&nbsp;million of costs related to the consolidation of
solution development groups within the Government segment, which is reflected in total operating
expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In fiscal year 2006, we recorded $1.6&nbsp;million
for asset impairment and other charges, principally for duplicative software as a result of recent
acquisition activity, which is reflected in total operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements
of Income. As discussed below, we completed the WWS Divestiture, which allows us to focus on our
technology-enabled business process outsourcing and information technology service offerings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2007, we acquired CDR Associates, LLC (&#147;CDR&#148;), a leading provider of credit balance audit
recovery and software services to healthcare payors, providers and state Medicaid agencies. The
purchase price of $27.2&nbsp;million, plus transaction costs excluding contingent consideration of up to
$15&nbsp;million based upon future financial performance, was funded from cash on hand and borrowings
under our Credit Facility. We believe this acquisition strengthens our position as a BPO provider
to the healthcare industry. The acquisition expands our service mix in the healthcare payor and
provider markets and provides a platform to bridge the gap between the payor and provider
communities. The operating results of the acquired business are included in our financial

Facility. The acquisition enables us to address key health and human services challenges facing
state and local government clients, including: expensive legacy systems; a need for cost
effectiveness; and a client-centered approach to service delivery. The acquired proprietary
@Vantage software addresses these clients&#146; challenges while meeting federal financial support
requirements for a commercial, off-the-shelf (&#147;COTS&#148;) solution. The operating results of the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Contract with the Department of Education</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have provided loan servicing for the Department of Education&#146;s (the &#147;Department&#148;) Direct
Student Loan program for over ten years. In 2003, the Department conducted a competitive
procurement for its &#147;Common Services for Borrowers&#148; initiative (&#147;CSB&#148;). CSB was a modernization
initiative which integrated a number of student loan processing services for the Department,
allowing the Department to increase loan servicing quality while saving overall program costs. In
November&nbsp;2003, the Department awarded us the CSB contract. Under this contract we provide
comprehensive loan servicing, consolidation loan processing, debt collection services on delinquent
accounts, IT infrastructure operations and support, maintenance and development of information
systems, and portfolio management services for the Department of Education&#146;s Direct Student Loan
program. The CSB contract has a 5-year base term which began in January&nbsp;2004 and provides the
Department of Education five one-year options to extend after the base term. We estimate that our
revenues from the CSB contract will exceed $1&nbsp;billion in total over the base term of the contract.
Annual revenues from this contract represent approximately 4% of our fiscal year 2007 revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2007, we and the Department agreed to cease development of certain software contemplated
under the CSB contract. At that time, we had implemented approximately $39&nbsp;million of internally
developed software into the current production system. As a result of the decision to cease
development, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $76.4&nbsp;million (approximately
$48.3&nbsp;million, net of income tax) related to in-process capitalized development costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Government Healthcare Contract</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2004, we were awarded a contract by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human
Services (&#147;DHHS&#148;) to replace and operate the North Carolina Medicaid Management Information System
(&#147;NCMMIS&#148;). There was a protest of the contract award; however, DHHS requested that we commence
performance under the contract. One of the parties protesting the contract has continued to seek
administrative and legal relief to set aside the contract award. However, we continued our
performance of the contract at the request of DHHS. On June&nbsp;12, 2006, we reported that contract
issues had arisen and each of ACS and DHHS alleged that the other party has breached the contract.
The parties entered into a series of standstill agreements in order to permit discussion of their
respective issues regarding the contract and whether the contract would be continued or terminated.
On July&nbsp;14, 2006, the DHHS sent us a letter notifying us of the termination of the contract. We
filed in the General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, in Wake County, North Carolina, a
complaint and motion to preserve records related to the contract. Subsequent to the filing of the
complaint, North Carolina produced records and represented to the Court that all records had been
produced, after which the complaint was dismissed. In a letter dated August&nbsp;1, 2006, DHHS notified
us of its position that the value of reductions in compensation assessable against the compensation
otherwise due to us under the contract is approximately $33&nbsp;million. On August&nbsp;14, 2006, we
provided a detailed response to that August&nbsp;1, 2006 letter contending that there should be no
reductions in compensation owed to us. Also, on August&nbsp;14, 2006 and in accordance with the
contract, we submitted our Termination Claim to DHHS seeking additional compensation of
approximately $27.1&nbsp;million. On January&nbsp;22, 2007, we filed a complaint in the General Court of
Justice, Superior Court Division, in Wake County, North Carolina against DHHS and the Secretary of
DHHS seeking to recover damages in excess of $40&nbsp;million that we have suffered as the result of
actions of DHHS and its Secretary. Our claim was based on breach of contract; breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing; breach of warranty; and misappropriation of our trade
secrets. In the complaint we also requested the court to grant a declaratory judgment that we were
not in default under the contract; and a permanent injunction against the State from using our
proprietary materials and disclosing our proprietary material to third parties. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2006, we recorded a charge of approximately $4.0&nbsp;million, of
which $3.9&nbsp;million was charged to revenue, related to our assessment of realization of amounts
previously recognized for the North Carolina MMIS contract.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;22, 2007, we settled all issues with DHHS. Pursuant to the settlement, DHHS rescinded its
June&nbsp;6, 2006 notice of intent to terminate the NCMMIS contract and its July&nbsp;14, 2006 notice of
termination and the parties agreed to a mutual termination of the contract. We agreed, as part of
the settlement, to license to DHHS certain work product we produced in connection with the NCMMIS
contract and DHHS has agreed to pay us the aggregate amount of $10.5&nbsp;million in four installments
beginning on or before March&nbsp;31, 2007 and ending on or before June&nbsp;30, 2008. We recognized $3.4
million in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 related to this settlement. In
addition, we have entered into several new contracts, with terms of two years, to provide new
services to DHHS and will be compensated based on achieving certain levels of cost savings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the December&nbsp;9, 2006 Compensation Committee meeting, it was recognized that the grants made
to Mr.&nbsp;Blodgett and Mr.&nbsp;Rexford were for a number of shares that were less than the number of
shares that would have been normally granted to a new CEO and new CFO because of the limited
number of options remaining available under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan. The Compensation
Committee noted that it should consider a future grant to supplement the number of options made in
the earlier grant so that the aggregate number of shares granted to Mr.&nbsp;Blodgett and Mr.&nbsp;Rexford
would be equal to the number that would normally be granted to a new CEO and new CFO. To
accomplish this purpose, at a meeting on July&nbsp;2, 2007, the Committee approved option grants (the
&#147;Grants&#148;) to Lynn Blodgett to purchase 60,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock under
the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and to John Rexford to purchase 25,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock

the Board of Directors, which occurred on July&nbsp;9, 2007 and on which date the Grants became

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), &#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; (&#147;SFAS
123(R)&#148;). SFAS 123(R) requires companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards
using a fair value method and recognize compensation cost in its financial statements. We adopted
SFAS 123(R) on a prospective basis beginning July&nbsp;1, 2005 for stock-based compensation awards
granted after that date and for unvested awards outstanding at that date using the modified
prospective application method. Prior to July&nbsp;1, 2005, we followed Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148; in accounting for our stock-based
compensation plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The adoption of SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 resulted in prospective
changes in our accounting for stock-based compensation awards, including recording stock-based
compensation expense and the related deferred income tax benefit on a prospective basis and
reflecting the excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation awards in cash
flows from financing activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in the recognition of compensation expense of $35&nbsp;million
($22.9&nbsp;million, net of deferred income tax benefits), or $0.19 per basic share and $0.18 per
diluted share, in wages and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
June&nbsp;30, 2006. In accordance with the modified prospective application method of SFAS 123(R),
prior period amounts have not been restated to reflect the recognition of stock-based compensation
costs as determined under SFAS 123.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In periods ending prior to July&nbsp;1, 2005, the income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options
were classified as net cash provided by operating activities pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force
(&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue No.&nbsp;00-15 &#147;Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit
Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option.&#148; However, for periods
ending after July&nbsp;1, 2005, pursuant to SFAS 123(R), the income tax benefits exceeding the recorded
deferred income tax benefit and any pre-adoption &#147;as-if&#148; deferred income tax benefit from
stock-based compensation awards (the excess tax benefits) are required to be reported in net cash
provided by financing activities. For the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2006, excess tax benefits from
stock-based compensation awards of $14.3&nbsp;million were reflected as an outflow in cash flows from
operating activities and an inflow in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, resulting in a net impact of zero on cash. During fiscal year 2005,
income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of $20.1&nbsp;million were reflected as an inflow

enterprise specializing in integrated learning solutions. The transaction was valued at
approximately $75.6&nbsp;million plus related transaction costs and was funded from cash on hand. The
purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair
value as of the date of acquisition. This acquisition provides us with a global technology
platform that we can leverage to deliver learning services to existing and potential clients, key
management talent in the learning BPO markets, expanded content development and delivery
capabilities and a broader presence in the rapidly growing learning BPO market. This acquisition

(&#147;Transport Revenue&#148;), a Switzerland based communications company. Transport Revenue consists of
three business units: fare collection, airport parking solutions and toll collection, with office
locations across nine countries. The transaction was valued at approximately $100.5&nbsp;million plus

million, excluding contingent consideration of up to $32&nbsp;million based upon future financial
performance, and was funded from cash on hand and borrowings under our Prior Facility (defined
below). In fiscal year 2007, we paid $18.1&nbsp;million of contingent consideration which was earned
during the year. This acquisition expanded our customer care service offerings in the finance and
telecommunications industries and extended our global capabilities and operations by adding

wholly owned subsidiary of ResCare, Inc., for approximately $69&nbsp;million, less transaction costs.
The proceeds were collected in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006. Assets sold were
approximately $31.6&nbsp;million and liabilities assumed by Arbor were approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, both
of which were included in the Government segment. We retained the net working capital related to
the WWS Divestiture. We recognized a pretax gain of $2.5&nbsp;million ($1.5&nbsp;million, net of income tax)
and $33.5&nbsp;million ($20.1&nbsp;million, net of income tax) in
fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively, upon the

2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Fiscal year 2006 operating loss included the following: a
provision for estimated litigation settlement related to the WWS Divestiture; and a provision for
uncollectible accounts receivable due to a change in our estimate of collectibility of the retained
outstanding receivables. Total provisions recorded in fiscal year 2006 were $3.3&nbsp;million ($2.1

tender offer to purchase up to 55.5&nbsp;million shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock at a price per share
not less than $56 and not greater than $63 (the &#147;Tender Offer&#148;). The Tender Offer commenced on
February&nbsp;9, 2006, and expired on March&nbsp;17, 2006 (as extended), and was funded with proceeds from
the Term Loan Facility (defined below). Our directors and executive officers, including our
Chairman, Darwin Deason, did not tender shares pursuant to the Tender Offer. The number of shares
purchased in the Tender Offer was 7,365,110 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock at an average price of
$63 per share plus transaction costs, for an
aggregate purchase amount of $475.9&nbsp;million. All of the shares purchased in the Tender Offer
were retired as of June&nbsp;30, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Voting Rights of Our Chairman</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the Tender Offer, Mr.&nbsp;Deason entered into a Voting Agreement with the Company
dated February&nbsp;9, 2006 (the &#147;Voting Agreement&#148;) in which he agreed to limit his ability to cause
the additional voting power he would hold as a result of the Tender Offer to affect the outcome of
any matter submitted to the vote of the stockholders of the Company after consummation of the
Tender Offer. Mr.&nbsp;Deason agreed that to the extent his voting power immediately after the Tender
Offer increased above the percentage amount of his voting power immediately prior to the Tender
Offer, Mr.&nbsp;Deason would cause the shares representing such additional voting power (the &#147;Excess
Voting Power&#148;) to appear, not appear, vote or not vote at any meeting or pursuant to any consent
solicitation in the same manner, and in proportion to, the votes or actions of all stockholders
including Mr.&nbsp;Deason whose Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B shares shall, solely for the purpose of
proportionality, be counted on a one for one vote basis (even though the Class&nbsp;B shares have ten
votes per share).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As the result of the purchase of approximately 7.4&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in the
Tender Offer, Mr.&nbsp;Deason&#146;s percentage increase in voting power above the percentage amount of his
voting power immediately prior to the Tender Offer was approximately 1.5%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Voting Agreement will have no effect on shares representing the approximately 36.7% voting
power of the Company held by Mr.&nbsp;Deason prior to the Tender Offer, which Mr.&nbsp;Deason will continue
to have the right to vote in his sole discretion, or on any increase in his voting percentage as a
result of any share repurchases by the Company. The Voting Agreement also does not apply to any
Class&nbsp;A shares that Mr.&nbsp;Deason may acquire after the Tender Offer through his exercise of stock
options, open market purchases or in any future transaction that we may undertake (including any
increase in voting power related to any Company share repurchase program). Other than as expressly
set forth in the Voting Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Deason continues to have the power to exercise all rights
attached to the shares he owns, including the right to dispose of his shares and the right to
receive any distributions thereon.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Voting Agreement will terminate on the earliest of (i)&nbsp;the mutual agreement of the Company
(authorized by not less than a majority of the vote of the then independent and disinterested
directors) and Mr.&nbsp;Deason, (ii)&nbsp;the date on which Mr.&nbsp;Deason ceases to hold any Excess Voting
Power, as calculated in the Voting Agreement, or (iii)&nbsp;the date on which all Class&nbsp;B shares are
converted into Class&nbsp;A shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Mr.&nbsp;Deason and a special committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of independent
directors, have not reached an agreement regarding the fair compensation to be paid to Mr.&nbsp;Deason
for entering into the Voting Agreement. However, whether or not Mr.&nbsp;Deason and our special
committee are able to reach agreement on compensation to be paid to Mr.&nbsp;Deason, the Voting
Agreement will remain in effect.
</DIV>
 <DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This summary of the Voting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Voting
Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit&nbsp;9.1 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed February&nbsp;9,
2006.

businesses of Mellon Financial Corporation (&#147;Acquired HR Business&#148;). The Acquired HR Business
provides consulting services, benefit plan administration services, and multi-scope HR outsourcing
services. The transaction was valued at approximately $405&nbsp;million, plus related transaction costs
and was initially funded from borrowings under our Prior Facility (as defined below). In fiscal
year 2006, we paid a net working capital settlement of $19.6&nbsp;million which was funded from cash on
hand and borrowings under our Prior Facility. This acquisition made us a stronger competitor in
the end-to-end human resources marketplace and strengthened our position as a global provider of
business process outsourcing services. The operating results of the acquired business are included

May&nbsp;1, 2005.

outsourcer specializing in applications management of packaged enterprise resource planning and
messaging services. The transaction was valued at approximately $73.5&nbsp;million, plus related
transaction costs. The transaction value includes $6.4&nbsp;million attributable to the 9.2% minority
interest we held in BlueStar prior to the acquisition; therefore, the net purchase price was
approximately $67.1&nbsp;million. Of this amount, approximately $61&nbsp;million was paid to former BlueStar
shareholders by June&nbsp;30, 2005 and was funded from borrowings under our then existing credit
facility and cash on hand. The remaining purchase price of approximately $6&nbsp;million was paid in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The acquisition of BlueStar improved our existing information

employer groups in the country. The transaction was valued at approximately $23.1&nbsp;million plus
related transaction costs, excluding contingent consideration of up to $17&nbsp;million maximum based
upon future financial performance, and was funded from borrowings under our then existing credit
facility and cash on hand. During fiscal year 2005, we accrued $6&nbsp;million of contingent

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Internal revenue growth is measured as total revenue growth less acquired revenue from acquisitions
and revenues from divested operations. At the date of acquisition, we identify the trailing twelve
months of revenue of the acquired company as the &#147;pre-acquisition revenue of acquired companies.&#148;
Pre-acquisition revenue of the acquired companies is considered &#147;acquired revenues&#148; in our
calculation, and revenues from the acquired company, either above or below that amount are
components of &#147;internal growth&#148; in our calculation. We use the calculation of internal revenue
growth to measure revenue growth excluding the impact of acquired revenues and the revenue
associated with divested operations and we believe these adjustments to historical reported results
are necessary to accurately reflect our internal revenue growth. Revenues from divested operations
are excluded from the internal revenue growth calculation in the periods following the effective
date of the divestiture. Prior period internal revenue growth calculations are not restated for
current period divestitures. Our measure of internal revenue growth may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures of other companies. The following table sets forth the calculation of
internal revenue growth (in thousands):

in our Government segment increased to $2.3&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2007 compared to $2.1&nbsp;billion in
fiscal year 2006. Revenue growth from acquisitions was 4%, primarily due to the acquisition of

early extinguishment of debt for the balance of the debt issue costs related to our Prior Facility.
Also contributing to the increase in other non-operating income, net were increases in interest
income on cash investments and long-term investments, including those supporting our deferred
compensation plans. The compensation cost related to our deferred compensation plans is included

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our effective income tax rate decreased to 34% in fiscal year 2007 from 35.7% in fiscal year 2006.
This effective income tax rate is comprised of the following: an effective tax rate on operations
of 35.5%, an effective tax rate on the CSB software impairment charges of 36.8% and a reduction in
rate attributable to one-time benefits realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. During
fiscal year 2007 we reversed $4.5&nbsp;million in income tax expense related to amounts previously
accrued for cash-based compensation related issues associated with Section 162(m) deductions
(please see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). Our
effective income tax rate on operations is higher than the 35% federal statutory rate primarily due
to the effect of state income taxes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenues</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue increased $1&nbsp;billion, or 23%, to $5.4&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2006 from $4.4&nbsp;billion in
fiscal year 2005. Excluding revenues related to the 2006 Divestitures, which were divested in the
second quarter of fiscal year 2006, our revenues increased $1.1&nbsp;billion, or 27%. Internal revenue
growth was 7% and the remainder of the growth was related to acquisitions. Fiscal years 2006 and
2005 include revenues related to the 2006 Divestitures of $104.2&nbsp;million and $218&nbsp;million,
respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue in our Commercial segment, which represented approximately 59% of our consolidated revenue
for fiscal year 2006, increased $1&nbsp;billion, or 46%, to $3.2&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2006 compared to
fiscal year 2005. Revenue growth from acquisitions was 33%, which includes a full year of revenues
from our fiscal year 2005 acquisitions of the Acquired HR Business, Superior and LiveBridge.
Internal revenue growth was 13%, due primarily to increased revenues related to contracts with
Disney, Nextel, Chubb &#038; Sons, Kaiser Southern, Humana, University of Phoenix, United Technologies,
Symetra, Glaxo-Smith-Kline, Delta Airlines, MeadWestvaco Corporation, Hallmark, Princeton
Healthcare, Cendant, Wachovia, Carefirst, College Loan Corporation, American Red Cross, Nellie Mae
and Aetna. These increases were partially offset by decreases related to the Gateway contract
termination in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, decreased revenues in our commercial
unclaimed property business and contracts with Motorola, United Healthcare and Nike in the current
year. The contracts discussed above collectively represented approximately 96% of our internal
revenue growth for the period in this segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue in our Government segment, which represented approximately 41% of our consolidated revenue
for fiscal year 2006, increased $10&nbsp;million, to $2.2&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal
year 2005. Excluding the impact of the revenues related to the 2006 Divestitures, revenues in our
Government segment increased to $2.1&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2006 compared to $2&nbsp;billion in fiscal
year 2005. Revenue growth from acquisitions was 5% for fiscal year 2006 as a result of the
Transport Revenue acquisition in the second quarter. Internal revenue growth was 1%, primarily due
to increased revenues in contracts with Texas Medicaid, State of New Jersey Department of Human
Services, State of Maryland, Social Security Administration, our commercial vehicle operations, New
York E-ZPass, State of New Hampshire, Pennsylvania Department of Motor Vehicles, the State of
Massachusetts, City of Dallas parking violations and the State of Mississippi. These increases
were partially offset by decreases due to the termination of our Michigan payment processing, New
York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Texas CHIP contracts and lower revenues in our
contracts with the States of Iowa and Georgia and our North Carolina MMIS contract, which included
a charge to revenue of $3.9&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2006 related to our assessment of realization of
amounts previously recognized for the North Carolina MMIS contract. The contracts discussed above
collectively represented approximately 99% of our internal revenue growth for the period in this
segment.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Wages and benefits increased $694&nbsp;million, or 37%, to $2.6&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal
year 2005. As a percentage of revenues, wages and benefits increased 4.9% to 48% in fiscal year
2006 from 43.1% in fiscal year 2005. As a percentage of revenue, approximately 7.6% of the
increase was primarily due to a full year impact of the acquisition of the Acquired HR Business and
Superior, which include consulting businesses, and LiveBridge, all of which have a higher component
of wages and benefits related to revenues than our existing operations. During fiscal year 2006
and 2005, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $35&nbsp;million and $6.1&nbsp;million,
respectively, as discussed above, or 0.7% and 0.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively, under
SFAS 123(R). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 1.5% as a percentage of revenue
as a result of the WWS Divestiture, which had a higher percentage of wages and benefits than our
retained business. Also included in wages and benefits in fiscal year 2006 were approximately $6.5
million in expense for involuntary termination charges for employees related to our restructuring
activities, approximately $5.7&nbsp;million in incremental transaction expenses related to the Acquired
HR Business and compensation expense of $5.4&nbsp;million related to the departure of Jeffrey A. Rich,
our former Chief Executive Officer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Services and supplies increased $122.2&nbsp;million, or 11.7%, to $1.2&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2006 from
fiscal year 2005. As a percentage of revenues, services and supplies decreased 2.2% to 21.8% in
fiscal year 2006 from 24% in fiscal year 2005. Approximately 1.3% of the decrease as a percentage
of revenues was due to the WWS Divestiture which had a higher component of services and supplies as
a percentage of revenues than our retained business. Approximately 1% of the decrease as a
percentage of revenues was due to the termination of a subcontractor arrangement in our Government
segment. Approximately 0.5% of the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due to an increase in
information technology services revenues, which have a lower component of services and supplies
than our business process outsourcing business. These decreases were partially offset by an
increase of approximately 1.1% as a percentage of revenues as a result of the Human Capital
Management Services Business, the combination of the Acquired HR Business and our other human
resources outsourcing businesses, which has a higher component of services and supplies than our
other operations. Services and supplies fiscal year 2006 includes approximately $0.6&nbsp;million
related to our restructuring activities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Rent, lease and maintenance increased $143.3&nbsp;million, or 28.5%, to $646.5&nbsp;million in fiscal year
2006 from fiscal year 2005. As a percentage of revenues, rent, lease and maintenance increased
0.5% to 12.1% in fiscal year 2006 from 11.6% in fiscal year 2005. This increase was primarily due
to increased software costs for new business, and approximately $0.7&nbsp;million related to our
restructuring activities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Operating income in fiscal year 2006 also includes losses of $39.5&nbsp;million (0.7% as a percentage of
revenues) related to two underperforming multi-scope human resources contracts (included in various
cost of revenues categories). Of this $39.5&nbsp;million loss, $5&nbsp;million was related to settlement of
various contract disputes with a client, and approximately $2.1&nbsp;million and $8.4&nbsp;million related to
a contract loss accrual and asset impairment charges, respectively, for another client. These
reserves, contract loss accrual and asset impairment are included in other cost of revenues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Interest expense increased $48.2&nbsp;million, to $68.4&nbsp;million, primarily due to interest expense on
the Senior Notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 and borrowings under our Credit
Facility for the purchase of shares in our Tender Offer in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006
and general corporate purposes, including the Transport Revenue and Livebridge acquisitions, and
share repurchases under our share repurchase programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other non-operating income, net increased $4.2&nbsp;million to $9.4&nbsp;million from $5.2&nbsp;million in the
prior year period, primarily due to interest income on cash investments and long-term investments,
including those supporting our deferred compensation plans. The compensation cost related to our
deferred compensation plans is included in wages and benefits. These gains were partially offset by
a loss of $4.1&nbsp;million on the early extinguishment of the balance of the debt issue costs related
to our Prior Facility.

    <TD>During fiscal year 2006, we paid approximately $85.8&nbsp;million related to the final
settlement of the Mellon transition services agreement. Under the transition services
agreement, Mellon provided certain accounting, treasury and payroll services for an interim
period while we integrated the Acquired HR Business. As part of these services, Mellon was
also paying certain operational costs on our behalf, such as employee related expenses and
accounts payable. This agreement and the related timing of payments to Mellon had a
favorable impact on our net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow (defined
below) in fiscal year 2005 of $75.9&nbsp;million and a negative impact on our net cash provided by
operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal year 2006 of $85.8&nbsp;million when the
Acquired HR Business was fully integrated. During fiscal year 2006, we also paid
approximately $26.3&nbsp;million to employees of the Acquired HR Business related to incentive
compensation that was earned prior to the date that we acquired the business.</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our fiscal year 2007 cash flows provided by operating activities were also impacted by collections
of accounts receivable, offset by timing of collections of unearned revenue, as well as payments
for hardware and software maintenance during the fiscal year 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Fiscal year 2006 cash flows provided by operating activities were also impacted by an increase in
accounts receivables related to signed new business and timing of collections related to other
accounts receivable and payments of approximately $5.2&nbsp;million related to the departure of Jeffrey
A. Rich, our former Chief Executive Officer. These decreases were offset by lower annual incentive
compensation payments and timing of payments to vendors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounts receivable fluctuations may have a significant impact on our cash flows provided by
operating activities. The payments received from clients on our billed accounts receivables and the
increase in such accounts receivable are reflected as a single component of our cash flows provided
by operating activities, and the timing of collections of these receivables may have either a
positive or negative impact on our liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For fiscal years 2007 and 2006, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards of $3.8
million and $14.3&nbsp;million, respectively, were reflected as an outflow in cash flows from operating
activities and an inflow in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows, resulting in a net impact of zero on cash. During fiscal year 2005, income tax
benefits from the exercise of stock options of $20.1&nbsp;million were reflected as an inflow in cash
flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. However, had SFAS
123(R) been in effect for fiscal year 2005, the portion of those income tax benefits that would
have been characterized as excess tax benefits in the Consolidated Statements

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">of Cash Flows would
have been $14.1&nbsp;million and would have decreased cash flows from operating activities and increased
cash flows from financing activities accordingly.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal year 2005, we generated approximately $739.3&nbsp;million in cash flows provided by
operating activities. As discussed above, fiscal year 2005 cash flows provided by operating
activities includes a temporary benefit of $75.9&nbsp;million related to the transition services
agreement with Mellon. Fiscal year 2005 cash flows provided by operating activities were negatively
impacted by the payment of approximately $19.3&nbsp;million related to the settlement of the interest
rate hedges associated with the issuance of the Senior Notes (please see <I>Derivative instruments and
hedging activities </I>below), the payment of a legal settlement of $10&nbsp;million and the payment of the
settlement on a client contract of $10&nbsp;million, both of which were accrued during fiscal year 2004,
as well as the timing of payments related to software used in our information technology services
business, transfer agent fees related to our unclaimed property business and other contract related
costs, offset by increased net income and increased collections on our accounts receivable
balances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Free cash flow is measured as cash flow provided by operating activities (as reported in our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow), less capital expenditures (purchases of property, equipment
and software, net of sales, as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow) less additions
to other intangible assets (as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). We believe
this free cash flow metric provides an additional measure of available cash flow after we have
satisfied the capital expenditure requirements of our operations, and should not be taken in
isolation to be a measure of cash flow available for us to satisfy all of our obligations and
execute our business strategies. We also rely on cash flows from investing and financing
activities which, together with free cash flow, are expected to be sufficient for us to execute our
business strategies. Our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures of other companies. The following table sets forth the calculations of free cash flow (in
thousands):

years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Historically, the capital intensity of our business has
ranged between 5 to 7%. During fiscal year 2006, the overall capital intensity of our business was
8% due to approximately $60&nbsp;million of investments for the following: investments related to
integrating the Acquired HR Business and expanding our human resources outsourcing technology
platform; investments made in our Government Healthcare technology platforms; the expansion of our

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;20, 2006, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the &#147;Credit
Agreement&#148;) with Citicorp USA, Inc., as Administrative Agent (&#147;Citicorp&#148;), Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., as Sole Lead Arranger and Book Runner, and
with Morgan Stanley Bank, SunTrust Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Wachovia Bank National
Association, Bank of America, N.A., Bear Stearns Corporate Lending and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as
Co-Syndication Agents, and various other lenders and issuers (the &#147;Credit Facility&#148;). The Credit
Facility provides for a senior secured term loan facility of $1.8&nbsp;billion, with the ability to
increase it by up to $2&nbsp;billion (as of June&nbsp;30, 2007), under certain circumstances (the &#147;Term Loan
Facility&#148;) and a senior secured revolving credit facility of $1&nbsp;billion with the ability to
increase it by up to $750&nbsp;million (the &#147;Revolving Facility&#148;), each of which is described more fully
below. At the closing of the Credit Facility, we and certain of our subsidiaries jointly borrowed
approximately $800&nbsp;million under the Term Loan Facility and approximately $93&nbsp;million under the
Revolving Facility. We used the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility to (i)&nbsp;refinance approximately
$278&nbsp;million in outstanding indebtedness under our 5-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement dated as of October&nbsp;27, 2004 (the &#147;Prior Facility&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;finance the purchase
of shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock tendered in the Company&#146;s &#147;Dutch Auction&#148; tender which
expired March&nbsp;17, 2006 (as extended) and (iii)&nbsp;for the payment of transaction costs, fees and
expenses related to the Credit Facility and Dutch Auction. As a result of the refinancing of the
Prior Facility, we wrote off approximately $4.1&nbsp;million in debt issue costs, which was included in
other non-operating income, net. A portion of the proceeds of the Revolving Facility were used to
refinance approximately $73&nbsp;million in outstanding indebtedness under the Prior Facility. The
remainder of the proceeds of the Revolving Facility were used for working capital purposes and to
fund our share repurchase programs. In addition, approximately $114&nbsp;million of letters of credit
were issued under the Credit Facility to replace letters of credit outstanding under the Prior
Facility. The Prior Facility was terminated on March&nbsp;20, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;6, 2006, we amended our Term Loan Facility. We borrowed an additional $500&nbsp;million on
July&nbsp;6, 2006 and an additional $500&nbsp;million on August&nbsp;1, 2006. As a result of the increase to the
facility, the Applicable Margin, as defined in the Credit Facility, increased to LIBOR plus 200
basis points. The borrowing rate under the Term Loan Facility as of August&nbsp;20, 2007 was 7.33%.
We used the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility increase to finance the purchase of shares of our
Class&nbsp;A common stock under the June&nbsp;2006 $1&nbsp;billion share repurchase authorization and for the
payment of transaction costs, fees and expenses related to the increase in the Term Loan Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility mature on March&nbsp;20, 2013, and will amortize in
quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount
of the loans advanced, with the balance payable on the final maturity date. Amounts borrowed under
the Term Loan Facility may also be repaid at any time at our discretion. Interest on the
outstanding balances under the Term Loan Facility is payable, at our option, at a rate equal to the
Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus the fluctuating Base Rate (as defined in
the Credit Facility), or at the Applicable Margin plus the current LIBOR (as defined in the Credit
Facility). The borrowing rate on the Term Loan Facility at June&nbsp;30, 2007 was 7.32%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Proceeds borrowed under the Revolving Facility will be used as needed for general corporate
purposes and to fund our share repurchase programs. Amounts under the Revolving Facility are
available on a revolving basis until the maturity date of March&nbsp;20, 2012. The Revolving Facility
allows for borrowings up to the full amount of the revolver in either U.S. Dollars or Euros. Up to
the U.S. dollar equivalent of $200&nbsp;million may be borrowed in other currencies, including Sterling,
Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Yen, Francs, Krones and New Zealand Dollars. Portions of the
Revolving Facility are available for issuances of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $700&nbsp;million
of letters of credit and for borrowings of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $150&nbsp;million of
swing loans. Interest on outstanding balances under the Revolving Facility is payable, at our
option, at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin plus the fluctuating Base Rate, or at the
Applicable Margin plus the current LIBOR for the applicable currency. The borrowing rate under the
Revolving Facility at June&nbsp;30, 2007 ranges from 3.87% to 5.37%, depending upon the currency of the
outstanding borrowings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Credit Facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature of up to $750&nbsp;million in the
aggregate allowing for future incremental borrowings under the Revolving Facility, which may be
used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility also includes an additional uncommitted
accordion feature of up to $2&nbsp;billion (as of June&nbsp;30, 2007) allowing for future incremental
borrowings under the Term Loan Facility which may be used to fund additional purchases of our
equity securities or for extinguishment of our Senior Notes. The Term Loan Facility accordion
expires on March&nbsp;20, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic
subsidiaries and certain of our foreign subsidiaries (but only to the extent such guarantees would
not result in materially adverse tax consequences). In addition, Credit Facility obligations are
secured under certain pledge agreements by (i)&nbsp;a first priority perfected pledge of all notes owned
by us and the guarantors and the capital stock of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries
and certain of our foreign subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions, including to the extent the
pledge would give rise to additional SEC reporting requirements for our subsidiaries or result in
materially adverse tax consequences), and (ii)&nbsp;a first priority perfected

other assets owned by us and the guarantors, subject to customary exceptions. As required under the
indentures governing our outstanding Senior Notes, we have granted equal and ratable liens in favor
of the holders of the Senior Notes in all assets discussed above, other than the accounts
receivable of the Company and our subsidiaries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Among other fees, we pay a commitment fee (payable quarterly) based on the amount of unused
commitments under the Revolving Facility (not including the uncommitted accordion feature discussed
above). The commitment fee payable at June&nbsp;30, 2007 was 0.375% of the unused commitment. We also
pay fees with respect to any letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. Letter of credit
fees at June&nbsp;30, 2007 were 1.35% of the currently issued and outstanding letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including but not limited to, restrictions on our
ability, and in certain instances, our subsidiaries&#146; ability, to incur liens, merge or dissolve,
make certain restricted payments, or sell or transfer assets. The Credit Facility also limits the
Company&#146;s and our subsidiaries&#146; ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, based upon
the total amount advanced under the Term Loan Facility at June&nbsp;30, 2007, we may not permit our
consolidated total leverage ratio to exceed 4.00 to 1.00, nor permit our consolidated senior
leverage ratio to exceed 3.00 to 1.00, nor permit our consolidated interest coverage ratio to be
less than 4.50 to 1.0 during specified periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the Credit Facility may be
accelerated and the lending commitments under the Credit Facility terminated. Such events of
default include, but are not limited to, payment default to lenders, material inaccuracies of
representations and warranties, covenant defaults, material payment defaults with respect to
indebtedness or guaranty obligations, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material
money judgments, material ERISA events, or change of control of the Company. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007,
we were in compliance with the covenants of our Credit Facility, as amended, as described further
below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Draws made under our credit facilities are made to fund cash acquisitions, share repurchases and
for general working capital requirements. During the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2007, the balance
outstanding under our credit facilities for borrowings ranged from $1.1&nbsp;billion to $2.1&nbsp;billion.
At June&nbsp;30, 2007, we had approximately $834.7&nbsp;million available under our Revolving Credit Facility
after giving effect to outstanding indebtedness of $52.1&nbsp;million and $113.2&nbsp;million of outstanding
letters of credit that secure certain contractual performance and other obligations and which
reduced the availability of our Revolving Facility. At June&nbsp;30, 2007, we had $1.8&nbsp;billion
outstanding under our Credit Facility, of which $1.8&nbsp;billion is reflected in long-term debt and $18
million is reflected in current portion of long-term debt, and approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion of which
bore interest at 7.32% and $52.1&nbsp;million bore interest from 3.87% to 5.37%. Please see <I>Derivatives

interest rates on our Credit Facility.

Credit Facility with respect to, among other provisions, waiver of any default or event of default
arising under the Credit Facility as a result of our failure to comply with certain reporting
covenants relating to other indebtedness, including covenants purportedly requiring the filing of
reports with either the SEC or the holders of such indebtedness, so long as those requirements were
complied with by December&nbsp;31, 2006. As consideration for this amendment, consent and waiver, we
paid a fee of $2.6&nbsp;million.

Senior Notes due June&nbsp;1, 2010 and $250&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% Senior Notes due
June&nbsp;1, 2015. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The net proceeds from the
offering of approximately $496&nbsp;million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and
expenses, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of our Prior Facility. We may
redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity, which may include prepayment
penalties determined according to pre-established criteria.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Senior Notes contain customary covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on our

Trust Company, N.A. (the &#147;Trustee&#148;), or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Notes. Such events of default include, but are not limited to, payment default,
covenant defaults, material payment defaults (other than under the Senior Notes) and voluntary or
involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, we were in compliance with the covenants
of our Senior Notes.

holders of our 5.20% Senior Notes due 2015 (the &#147;5.20% Senior Notes&#148;) issued by us under that
certain Indenture dated June&nbsp;6, 2005 (the &#147;Indenture&#148;) between us and Trustee advising us that we
were in default of our covenants. The letter alleged that our failure to timely file our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 by September&nbsp;13, 2006, was a default under
the terms of the Indenture. On September&nbsp;29, 2006, we received a letter from CEDE sent on behalf of
the same persons declaring an acceleration with respect to the 5.20% Senior Notes, as a result of
our failure to remedy the purported default set forth in the September&nbsp;22, 2006 letter related to
our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2006. The
September&nbsp;29, 2006 letter declared that the principal amount and premium, if any, and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on the 5.20% Senior Notes were due and payable immediately, and demanded
payment of all amounts owed in respect of the 5.20% Senior Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On September&nbsp;29, 2006 we received a letter from the Trustee with respect to the 5.20% Senior Notes.
The letter alleged that we were in default of our covenants under the Indenture with respect to the
5.20% Senior Notes, as the result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 on or before September&nbsp;28, 2006. On October&nbsp;6, 2006, we received a
letter from the Trustee declaring an acceleration with respect to the 5.20% Senior Notes as a
result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending June&nbsp;30,
2006 on or before September&nbsp;28, 2006. The October&nbsp;6, 2006 letter declared the principal amount and

October&nbsp;9, 2006, we received letters from certain holders of the 4.70% Senior Notes issued by us
under the Indenture, advising us that we were in default of our covenants under the Indenture. The
letters alleged that our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period
ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 by September&nbsp;13, 2006, was a default under the terms of the Indenture. On
November&nbsp;9, 10 and 16, 2006, we received letters from CEDE sent on behalf of certain holders of our
4.70% Senior Notes, declaring an acceleration of the 4.70% Senior Notes as the result of our
failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006. The

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">It is our position that no default has occurred under the Indenture and that no acceleration has
occurred with respect to the 5.20% Senior Notes or the 4.70% Senior Notes or otherwise under the
Indenture. Further we have filed a lawsuit against the Trustee in the United States District Court,
Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, seeking a declaratory judgment affirming our position.
On January&nbsp;8, 2007, the Court entered an order substituting Wilmington Trust Company for the
Trustee. On January&nbsp;16, 2007, Wilmington Trust Company filed an answer and counterclaim. The
counterclaim seeks immediate
payment of all principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes. Alternatively, the
counterclaim seeks damages measured by the difference between the fair market value of the Senior
Notes on or about September&nbsp;22, 2006 and par value of the Senior Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Unless and until there is a final judgment rendered in the lawsuit described above (including any
appellate proceedings), no legally enforceable determination can be made as to whether the failure
to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 is a default
under the Indenture as alleged by the letters referenced above. If there is a final legally
enforceable determination that the failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 is a default under the Indenture, and that acceleration with respect to
the Senior Notes was proper, the principal and premium, if any, and all accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on the Senior Notes would be immediately due and payable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the event the claim of default against us made by certain holders of the Senior Notes is upheld
in a court of law and we are required to pay off the Senior Notes, it is most likely that we would
utilize the Credit Facility to fund such payoff. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we can
utilize borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain liquidity requirements,
or may seek additional commitments for funding under the Term Loan Facility of the Credit Facility.
We estimate we have sufficient liquidity to meet both the needs of our operations and any
potential payoff of the Senior Notes. While we do have availability under our Credit Facility to
draw funds to repay the Senior Notes, there may be a decrease in our credit availability that could
otherwise be used for other corporate purposes, such as acquisitions and share repurchases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;19, 2006, we entered into an Instrument of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance with
The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. and Wilmington Trust Company, whereby The Bank of New York
Trust Company, N.A. resigned as trustee, as well as other offices or agencies, with respect to the
Senior Notes, and was replaced by Wilmington Trust Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If our Senior Notes are refinanced or the determination is made that the outstanding balance is due
to the noteholders, the remaining unrealized loss on forward interest rate agreements reported in
other comprehensive income of $13.8&nbsp;million ($8.6&nbsp;million, net of income tax), unamortized deferred
financing costs of $2.6&nbsp;million ($1.7&nbsp;million, net of income tax) and unamortized discount of $0.6
million ($0.4&nbsp;million, net of income tax) associated with our Senior Notes as of June&nbsp;30, 2007 may
be adjusted and reported as interest expense in our Consolidated
Statements of Income in the period
of refinancing or demand.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain contracts, primarily in our Government segment, require us to provide a surety bond or a
letter of credit as a guarantee of performance. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, outstanding surety bonds of
$524&nbsp;million and $90.9&nbsp;million of our outstanding letters of credit secure our performance of
contractual obligations with our clients. Approximately $22.3&nbsp;million of letters of credit and
$1.8&nbsp;million of surety bonds secure our casualty insurance and vendor programs and other corporate
obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event
of default in our performance of our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we
believe is remote. We believe that we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity
from our cash flow and our Credit Facility to respond to future requests for proposals.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Following our tender offer completed in March&nbsp;2006, our credit ratings were downgraded by Moody&#146;s
and Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s, both to below investment grade. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s further downgraded us to
BB upon our announcement in June&nbsp;2006 of the approval by our Board of Directors of a new $1&nbsp;billion
share repurchase plan. Fitch initiated its coverage of us in August&nbsp;2006 at a rating of BB, except

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 by the September&nbsp;28, 2006 extended

agencies have placed ACS on review for potential downgrade. There may be additional reductions in
our ratings depending on the timing and amounts that may be drawn under our Credit Facility. As a

the price of the bonds to us or require us to provide collateral such as a letter of credit.
However, we believe that we will continue to have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and
liquidity from our cash flow and Credit Facility to respond to future requests for proposals. In
addition, certain of our commercial outsourcing contracts provide that, in the event our credit
ratings are downgraded to certain specified levels, the customer may elect to terminate its
contract with us and either pay a reduced termination fee or in some instances, no termination fee.
While we do not anticipate that the downgrading of our credit ratings will result in a material
loss of
commercial outsourcing revenue due to the customer&#146;s exercise of these termination rights, there
can be no assurance that such a credit ratings downgrade will not adversely affect these customer
relationships.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We hedge the variability of a portion of our anticipated future Mexican peso cash flows through
foreign exchange forward agreements. The agreements are designated as cash flow hedges of
forecasted payments related to certain operating costs of our Mexican operations. As of June&nbsp;30,
2007 and 2006, the notional amount of these agreements totaled 312&nbsp;million pesos (approximately
$27.9&nbsp;million) and 217.5&nbsp;million pesos (approximately $19.5&nbsp;million), respectively. These
agreements expire at various dates over the next 12&nbsp;months. Upon termination of these agreements,
we will purchase Mexican pesos at the exchange rates specified in the forward agreements to be used
for payments on our forecasted Mexican peso operating costs. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, the unrealized
gain on these foreign exchange forward agreements, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss), net, was $0.6&nbsp;million ($0.4&nbsp;million, net of income tax), and the fair market value
of $0.6&nbsp;million is reflected in other current assets. As of June&nbsp;30, 2006, the unrealized loss on
these foreign exchange forward agreements, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss), net, was $0.5&nbsp;million ($0.3&nbsp;million, net of income tax) and the fair market value $0.5
million was reflected in other current liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As part of the Transport Revenue acquisition, we acquired foreign exchange forward agreements that
hedge our French operation&#146;s Euro foreign exchange exposure related to its Canadian dollar and U.
S. dollar revenues. These agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No.&nbsp;133,
&#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 133&#148;). As a result, we
recorded a gain on hedging instruments of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million ($1.1&nbsp;million, net of income
tax) for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2006 in other non-operating income, net in our Consolidated
Statements of Income. The gain on hedging instruments was not material for the year ended June&nbsp;30,
2007. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, the notional amount of these agreements totaled 25.2&nbsp;million
Euros (approximately $33.9&nbsp;million) and 31.2&nbsp;million Euros (approximately $39.1&nbsp;million),
respectively, and are set to expire at various times over the next four years. A liability was
recorded for the related fair value of approximately $4.3&nbsp;million and $4.1&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30,
2007 and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In order to hedge the variability of future interest payments related to our Senior Notes issuance,
we entered into forward interest rate agreements in April&nbsp;2005. The agreements were designated as
cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments in anticipation of the issuance of the Senior
Notes. The notional amount of the agreements totaled $500&nbsp;million and the agreements were
terminated in June&nbsp;2005 upon issuance of the Senior Notes. The settlement of the forward interest
rate agreements of $19&nbsp;million ($12&nbsp;million, net of income tax) was recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), net, and will be amortized as an increase in reported interest expense
over the term of the Senior Notes, with approximately $2.5&nbsp;million to be amortized over the next 12
months. During fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we amortized approximately $2.5&nbsp;million, $2.5
million and $0.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to interest expense. The amount of gain or loss related to
hedge ineffectiveness was not material.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2007, we entered into a five-year amortizing interest rate swap agreement. As of June&nbsp;30,
2007, the notional amount of the agreement totaled $700&nbsp;million. The agreement is designated as a
cash flow hedge of forecasted interest payments on up to $700&nbsp;million of outstanding floating rate
debt under our Credit Facility. The interest rate swap is structured such that we pay a fixed rate
of interest of 4.897%, and receive a floating rate of interest based on one month LIBOR. The fair
value of the agreement of $8.1&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2007 reflects termination cash value. The
unrealized gain of $8.1&nbsp;million ($5.3&nbsp;million, net of income tax), is reflected in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), net at June&nbsp;30, 2007. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, the fair market
value of $8.1&nbsp;million was reflected in other assets.

with SEC rules and regulations, including shares that could be purchased pursuant to SEC Rule
10b5-1. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases was based on the level of cash
and debt balances, general business conditions and other factors, including alternative investment
opportunities, and purchases under these plans were funded from various sources, including, but not
limited to, cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under our credit facilities.
Under our previously authorized share repurchase programs, we had repurchased approximately 2.2
million and 4.9&nbsp;million shares, respectively, at a total cost of approximately $115.8&nbsp;million and
$250.8&nbsp;million, respectively during fiscal years 2006 and 2005. We reissued
approximately 0.3&nbsp;million shares and 0.6&nbsp;million shares, respectively, for proceeds of
approximately $17.9&nbsp;million and $28.5&nbsp;million, respectively, to fund contributions to our employee
stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan during fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal
year 2007, we reissued approximately 57,000 shares for proceeds totaling approximately $2.8&nbsp;million
to fund contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June and August&nbsp;2006, our Board of Directors authorized two share repurchase programs of up to
$1&nbsp;billion each of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. The programs, which are open ended, allow us to
repurchase our shares on the open market, from time to time, in accordance with the requirements of
the SEC rules and regulations, including shares that could be purchased pursuant to SEC Rule
10b5-1. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the
level of cash and debt balances, general business conditions, and other factors, including
alternative investment opportunities. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, we had repurchased approximately 19.9
million shares under the June&nbsp;2006 authorization at an average cost of approximately $50.30 per
share (approximately $1&nbsp;billion) all of which have been retired. A total of 14.4&nbsp;million shares
with an average cost of approximately $50.64 per share (approximately $730.7&nbsp;million) were
purchased and retired in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. No repurchases have been made
under the August&nbsp;2006 authorization as of the date of this filing. If any additional repurchases
are made, such repurchases would be funded from borrowings under our Credit Facility.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, as a result of our internal
investigation into our stock option grant practices, we restated certain of our previously filed
Consolidated Financial Statements and recorded cumulative adjustments for non-cash stock-based
compensation expense totaling $51.2&nbsp;million. While these expenses are non-cash, the amendment of
the affected stock options and income tax related impacts have required and may continue to require
the use of cash.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Through June&nbsp;30, 2007, we recorded approximately $33.4&nbsp;million of additional income taxes,
estimated penalties and interest, net of the reversal discussed below, related to disallowed
Section 162(m) executive compensation deductions resulting from revised measurement dates. At this
time, we cannot predict when these Section 162(m) issues will be resolved; however, during the
third quarter of fiscal year 2007, we paid approximately $35&nbsp;million of estimated income taxes,
penalties and interest related to Section 162(m) issues in order to reduce future interest that
would accrue on the amounts of estimated taxes, penalties and interest. This payment is reflected
in cash flows from operating activities at June&nbsp;30, 2007. During fiscal year 2007, we reversed
approximately $6&nbsp;million of accrued income taxes, penalties and interest associated with Section
162(m) issues attributable to factors unrelated to revised measurement dates as we believe an
accrual for these amounts is no longer required.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2006, we amended the exercise price of outstanding stock options of certain current
executive officers, other executive officers and former executive officers in order to re-price all
or a portion of the respective option grant to the correct accounting measurement date to avoid
adverse tax consequences to individual option holders under Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue
Code. We will pay cash payments in the aggregate amount of $2.4&nbsp;million in accordance with the
terms of the amendment, which will be paid in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 from cash flows
from operating activities. Of the $2.4&nbsp;million cash payment, approximately $0.5&nbsp;million was
expensed in fiscal year 2007, and the balance was charged to Additional Paid-in Capital. If options
are exercised, such exercise prices to be paid by option holders is expected to offset the related
amounts of the cash payments related to those exercised options; however, the timing of any such
exercises cannot be determined.

amended option and the original exercise price per share of such amended option, multiplied by the
number of unexercised shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock subject to such amended option.
This payment will be made on or before the eligible option holder&#146;s first regular payroll date in
January&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The tender offer expired on July&nbsp;17, 2007. Pursuant to the offer, we accepted for amendment options
to purchase 1,696,650 shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, which represented 99.6% of the shares of
our Class&nbsp;A common stock subject to all
Eligible Options. We will pay cash payments in the aggregate amount of $4.0&nbsp;million in accordance
with the terms of the tender offer, which will be paid in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008
from cash flows from operating activities. Of the $4.0&nbsp;million cash payment, we anticipate that
approximately $1.3&nbsp;million will be expensed, and the balance will be charged to Additional Paid-in
Capital in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. If options are exercised, such exercise prices to
be paid by option holders is expected to offset the related amounts of the cash payments related to
those exercised options; however, the timing of any such exercises cannot be determined.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2007, we notified former employees with vested, unexercised and outstanding options which
had exercise prices per share that were less, or may have been less, than the fair market value per
share of ACS on the revised measurement dates for such options, as determined by us for accounting
and tax purposes, that we will pay them the additional 20% income tax imposed by Section&nbsp;409A based
on the excess, if any, of the fair market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock (up to $62 per share)
on the date a triggering event occurs or condition exists that under Section&nbsp;409A results in the
excess being recognized and reported as income on the former employee&#146;s W-2 and the exercise price
of the affected option (reduced by any gain that had become subject to tax in a prior year because
of an earlier triggering event). We anticipate that these income tax reimbursements will be up to
approximately $1.9&nbsp;million based on the current fair market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock on
the exercise date and will be paid from cash flows from operating activities as the triggering
event occurs for each option holder, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. In the
first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we will accrue the estimated charge related to these income tax
reimbursements based on the current fair market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and adjust the
accrual each quarter until the options are exercised.

June&nbsp;30, 2006. Our working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) increased
$135.5&nbsp;million to $839.7&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2007 from $704.2&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2006. Our current

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We believe that available cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations
and available borrowings under our Credit Facility, will provide adequate funds for our anticipated
internal growth and operating needs, including capital expenditures, and will meet the cash
requirements of our contractual obligations. However, due to the additional borrowings made in
relation to our share repurchase programs and if we utilize the unused portion of our Credit
Facility to repay the Senior Notes or for other corporate purposes, our indebtedness and interest
expense would increase, possibly significantly, and our indebtedness could be substantial in
relation to our stockholders&#146; equity. Should interest rates continue to rise, our interest expense
could increase, possibly significantly, and impact our results of operations and cash flows. We
believe that our expected cash flow provided by operating activities, and anticipated access to the
unused portion of our Credit Facility and capital markets will be adequate for our expected
liquidity needs, including capital expenditures, and to meet the cash requirements of our
contractual obligations. In addition, we intend to continue our growth through
acquisitions, which could require significant commitments of capital. In order to pursue such
opportunities we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive
securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to our future acquisitions and expansion
opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We expect to contribute approximately $14.5&nbsp;million to our pension plans in fiscal year 2008.
Minimum pension funding requirements are not included in the table above as such amounts are zero
for our pension plans as of June&nbsp;30, 2007. Please see Critical Accounting Policies and Note 13 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our pension plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed above, certain contracts, primarily in our Government segment, require us to provide a
surety bond or a letter of credit as a guarantee of performance. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, outstanding
surety bonds of $524&nbsp;million and $90.9&nbsp;million of our outstanding letters of credit secure our
performance of contractual obligations with our clients. Approximately $22.3&nbsp;million of letters of
credit and $1.8&nbsp;million of surety bonds secure our casualty insurance and vendor programs and other
corporate
obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of
default in our performance of our obligations under each contract; the probability of which we
believe is remote. We believe that we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity
from our cash flow and our Credit Facility to respond to future requests for proposals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are obligated to make certain contingent payments to former shareholders of acquired entities
upon satisfaction of certain contractual criteria in conjunction with certain acquisitions. During
fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we made contingent consideration payments of $25.4&nbsp;million, $9.8
million and $17&nbsp;million, respectively, related to acquisitions completed in prior years. As of
June&nbsp;30, 2007, the maximum aggregate amount of the outstanding contingent obligations to former
shareholders of acquired entities is approximately $90.6&nbsp;million, of which $21&nbsp;million has been
earned as of June&nbsp;30, 2007. The $21&nbsp;million was accrued as of June&nbsp;30, 2007 and is expected to be
paid during the first half of fiscal year 2008. Any such payments primarily result in a
corresponding increase in goodwill.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We indemnified Lockheed Martin Corporation against certain specified claims from certain pre-sale
litigation, investigations, government audits and other issues related to the majority of the
federal business sold in November&nbsp;2003. Our contractual maximum exposure under these
indemnifications is $85&nbsp;million; however, we believe the actual exposure to be significantly less.
As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, other accrued liabilities include a reserve for these claims in an amount we
believe to be adequate at this time. As discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, we agreed to indemnify ManTech International Corporation with respect to the DOJ
investigation related to purchasing activities at Hanscom during the period 1998-2000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our Education Services business, which is included in our Commercial segment, performs third party
student loan servicing in the Federal Family Education Loan program (&#147;FFEL&#148;) on behalf of various
financial institutions. We service these loans for investors under outsourcing arrangements and do
not acquire any servicing rights that are transferable by us to a third party. At June&nbsp;30, 2007,
we serviced a FFEL portfolio of approximately 2.2&nbsp;million loans with an outstanding principal
balance of approximately $32.5&nbsp;billion. Some servicing agreements contain provisions that, under
certain circumstances, require us to purchase the loans from the investor if the loan guaranty has
been permanently terminated as a result of a loan default caused by our servicing error. If
defaults caused by us are cured during an initial period, any obligation we may have to purchase
these loans expires. Loans that we purchase may be subsequently cured, the guaranty reinstated and
then we repackage the loans for sale to third parties. We evaluate our exposure under our purchase
obligations on defaulted loans and establish a reserve for potential losses, or default liability
reserve, through a charge to the provision for loss on defaulted loans purchased. The reserve is
evaluated periodically and adjusted based upon management&#146;s analysis of the historical performance
of the defaulted loans. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, other accrued liabilities include reserves
which we believe to be adequate.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions or conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and
uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and
conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of
our Consolidated Financial Statements involve significant judgments and estimates.

</DIV>


 <DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that do not require

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">estimates that are susceptible to change. Revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion
accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our policy follows the guidance from SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148; (&#147;SAB
104&#148;), unless the transaction is within the scope of other specific authoritative guidance. SAB 104
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements and updates Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13 to be consistent with Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;00-21, &#147;Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables&#148; (&#147;EITF 00-21&#148;). We
recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been
provided to the client, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal year 2007, approximately 74% of our revenue was recognized based on transaction
volumes, approximately 9% was fixed fee based, wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our
performance obligations under the arrangement, approximately 5% was related to cost reimbursable
contracts, approximately 5% of our revenue was recognized using percentage-of-completion accounting
and the remainder is related to time and material contracts. Our revenue mix is subject to change
due to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and new business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as
incurred, such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience. Revenues on
unit-price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and
accepted by the client. Revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual
rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues for business process outsourcing services are recognized as services are rendered,
generally on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed. Information technology
processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client, generally at the
contractual selling prices of resources consumed or capacity utilized by our clients. Revenues from
annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period.
Revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties
regarding customer acceptance have expired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system
development and implementation services are recognized over the contract term based on the

Certain Production-Type Contracts&#148; (&#147;SOP 81-1&#148;). SOP 81-1 requires the use of
percentage-of-completion accounting for long-term contracts that are binding agreements between us
and our customers in which we agree, for compensation, to perform a service to the customer&#146;s
specifications. These services require that we perform significant, extensive and complex design,
development, modification and implementation activities for our customers&#146; systems. Performance
will often extend over long periods, and our right to receive future payment depends on our future
performance in accordance with the agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The percentage-of-completion methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable
revenue using the percentage of services completed, on a current cumulative cost to estimated total
cost basis, using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period. Due to the longer term
nature of these projects, developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment.
Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of
the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the
nature and complexity of the work to be performed, and the impact of delayed performance. If
changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs
or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases
in revenues and costs, and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts
that give rise to that revision become known.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">EITF 00-21 addresses the accounting treatment for an arrangement to provide the delivery or
performance of multiple products and/or services where the delivery of a product or system or
performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time.
EITF 00-21 does not impact the use of SOP 81-1 for contract elements that fall within the scope of
SOP 81-1, such as the implementation or development of an information technology system to client
specifications under a long-term contract. Where an implementation or development project is
contracted with a client, and we will also provide services or operate the system over a period of
time, EITF 00-21 provides the methodology for separating the contract elements and allocating total
arrangement consideration to the contract elements but does not stipulate the revenue recognition
methodology that should be applied to these separate elements. In certain instances where revenue
cannot be allocated to a contract element delivered earlier than other elements, costs of delivery
are deferred and recognized as the subsequent elements are delivered. Costs deferred cannot exceed
the relative fair value of the related element. We adopted the provisions of EITF 00-21 on a
prospective basis for transactions entered into or modified after July&nbsp;1, 2003.

Contingencies&#148; (&#147;SFAS 5&#148;). SFAS 5 requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss
contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that
it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the
financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for claims
and contingencies requires us to use our judgment. We consult with legal counsel on those issues
related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the
ordinary course of business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our contracts with clients typically span several years. We continuously review and reassess our
estimates of contract profitability. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a
loss accrual is recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period it is first
identified. Circumstances that could potentially result in contract losses over the life of the
contract include decreases in volumes of transactions, variances from expected costs to deliver our
services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the fact that we are primarily a services company, our business acquisitions typically
result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of
future period amortization expense and possible expense we could incur as a result of an
impairment. In addition, in connection with our revenue arrangements, we incur costs to originate
long-term contracts and to perform the transition and setup activities necessary to enable us to
perform under the terms of the arrangement. We capitalize certain incremental direct costs which
are related to the contract origination or transition, implementation and setup activities and
amortize them over the term of the arrangement. From time to time, we also provide certain
inducements to customers in the form of various arrangements, including contractual credits, which
are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. The
determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and
assumptions about future business trends and growth. In addition to our annual impairment testing,
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of
goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we
compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its underlying book value. In evaluating
intangible assets for impairment, we compare the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to
its underlying book value. Such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions
of future revenues, costs and expenses and other factors. If an event occurs which would cause us
to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other
intangible assets, such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a
material impact on our financial results.

SFAS 123(R) requires us to recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment arrangements

all stock-based awards granted after July&nbsp;1, 2005 and for all unvested stock options outstanding as
of July&nbsp;1, 2005, beginning in the first quarter of adoption. For all unvested options outstanding

on the fair value using revised grant dates as determined in connection with our internal
investigation into our stock option grant practices (please see Note 21 to our Consolidated

the estimated forfeiture rates so that only the compensation expense related to stock-based payment
arrangements that vest are included in wages and benefits. If the actual number of forfeitures
differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be
required in future periods.

Amendment of FASB Statements No.&nbsp;87, 88, 106, and 132R&#148; (&#147;SFAS 158&#148;). This Statement requires
recognition of the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the statement of financial position
as an asset or liability if the plan is overfunded or underfunded, respectively. Changes in the
funded status of a plan are required to be recognized in the year in which the changes occur, and
reported in comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. Further, certain
gains and losses that were not previously recognized in the financial statements are required to be
reported in comprehensive income, and certain disclosure requirements were changed. SFAS No.&nbsp;158
also requires the measurement date of the plan&#146;s funded status to be the same as the company&#146;s
fiscal year end. There was no change to our June&nbsp;30 measurement date as a result of the adoption
of SFAS 158. Adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in an increase to accumulated other comprehensive

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We estimate the long-term rate of return on UK, Canadian and US plan assets will be 6.5%, 7% and
8%, respectively, based on the long-term target asset allocation. Expected returns for the
following asset classes used in the plans are based on a combination of long-term historical
returns and current and expected market conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The UK pension scheme&#146;s target asset allocation is 50% equity securities, 40% debt securities and
10% in real estate. External investment managers actively manage all of the asset classes. The
target asset allocation has been set by the plan&#146;s trustee board with a view to meeting the
long-term return assumed for setting the employer&#146;s contributions while also reducing volatility
relative to the plan&#146;s liabilities. The managers engaged by the trustees manage their assets with
a view to seeking moderate out-performance of appropriate benchmarks for each asset class. At this
time, the trustees do not engage in any alternative investment strategies, apart from UK commercial

30% larger capitalization Canadian stocks, 30% developed and larger capitalization Global ex Canada

investment manager actively manages all of the asset classes. This manager uses an equal blend of
large cap value and large cap growth for stocks in order to participate in the returns generated by
stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. The bonds are managed using a
core approach where multiple strategies are engaged such as interest rate anticipation, credit
selection and yield curve positioning to mitigate overall risk. At this time, the manager does not
engage in any alternative investment strategies.

that certain positions may be challenged and that we may not succeed. We adjust these reserves in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2007, we entered into a five-year amortizing interest rate swap agreement. At June&nbsp;30,
2007, the notional amount of the agreement was $700&nbsp;million. The agreement is designated as a cash
flow hedge of forecasted interest payments on up to $700&nbsp;million of outstanding floating rate debt
under our Credit Facility. The interest rate swap is structured such that we pay a fixed interest
rate of 4.897%, and receive a floating interest rate based on one month LIBOR. Risk can be
estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in short-term market
interest rates. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, the fair value of the agreement is approximately $8.1&nbsp;million
and reflects the termination cash value. If interest rates were 10% lower at June&nbsp;30, 2007, the
fair value of the interest rate swap agreement would be a liability of approximately $2.5&nbsp;million.
Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement would not affect our results of
operations or cash flows unless terminated prior to maturity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We entered into fixed rate Senior Notes during fiscal year 2005. The Senior Notes are subject to
market risk from changes in interest rates. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a
near-term adverse movement of 10% in market interest rates. The fair value of the Senior Notes as
of June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006 was $459.4&nbsp;million and $448&nbsp;million, respectively, based on quoted market
prices. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at June&nbsp;30, 2007, the fair value of the Senior
Notes would be approximately $445.6&nbsp;million and $473.9&nbsp;million, respectively. Changes in the fair
value of our fixed rate Senior Notes would not impact our results of operations or cash flows,
unless redeemed prior to maturity.

from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U. S. denominated foreign
investments and foreign currency transactions. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a
near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these
rates were 10% higher or lower at June&nbsp;30, 2007, there would have been no material adverse impact
on our results of operations or financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We hedge the variability of a portion of our anticipated future Mexican Peso cash flows through
foreign exchange forward agreements. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that
market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our foreign exchange forward agreements. The
foreign exchange risk is computed based on the market value of the forward agreements as affected
by changes in the corresponding foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis represents the
hypothetical changes in the value of the foreign exchange forward agreements and does not reflect
the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. Fluctuations in the fair value of the
foreign exchange forward agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
net. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, a 10% adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rate with all
other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our foreign
exchange forward agreements of $3.2&nbsp;million. Changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange
forward agreements would not impact our results of operations or cash flows, unless terminated
prior to maturity.

revenues. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have
on the fair value of our foreign exchange forward agreements. The foreign exchange risk is computed
based on the market value of the forward agreements as affected by changes in the corresponding

of the foreign exchange forward agreements and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the
underlying exposure. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, a 10% adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange
rate with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of
our foreign exchange forward agreements of approximately $3.5&nbsp;million. Changes in the fair value

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
June&nbsp;30, 2007, based on criteria established in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s
management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), Share Based
Payment, as of July&nbsp;1, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As described in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has
excluded Primax Recoveries, Inc. (&#147;Primax&#148;) and Systech Integrators, Inc. (&#147;Systech&#148;) from its
assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2007 because they were
acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during fiscal year 2007. We have also
excluded Primax and Systech from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Primax
and Systech are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues represent 2.3% and
1.6%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year
ended June&nbsp;30, 2007.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Description of business and basis of presentation</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are a Fortune 500 and S&#038;P 500 company with approximately 60,000 employees providing business
process outsourcing and information technology services to commercial and government clients. We
were incorporated in Delaware on June&nbsp;8, 1988 and our corporate headquarters is located in Dallas,
Texas. Our clients have time-critical, transaction-intensive business and information processing
needs, and we typically service these needs through long-term contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Consolidated Financial Statements are comprised of our accounts and the accounts of our
controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Investments in business entities in which we do not have control, but have the ability
to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for by the
equity method. Other investments are accounted for by the cost method. Our fiscal year ends on
June&nbsp;30. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, the reported amount of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period, as well as the accompanying notes. These estimates are based on
information available to us. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We present cost of revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income based on the nature of the
costs incurred. Substantially all these costs are incurred in the provision of services to our
customers. The selling, general and administrative costs included in cost of revenues are not
material and are not separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Cash and cash equivalents</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash, short-term investments in commercial paper,
and money market investments that have an initial maturity of three months or less. Cash
equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Allowance for doubtful accounts</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We specifically analyze
accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends,
and changes in our customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of our
allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account
receivable may result in additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period
in which the change occurs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Property, equipment and software, net</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for equipment ranges primarily from 3
to 12&nbsp;years and for buildings and improvements up to 40&nbsp;years. Leasehold improvements are
depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, &#147;Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use&#148; (&#147;SOP 98-1&#148;), certain costs related to the development or purchase of
internal-use software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software.
Costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements, which will not result in additional functionality,
are expensed as incurred. During fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we capitalized approximately
$65.1&nbsp;million, $104.7&nbsp;million and $57.4&nbsp;million, respectively, in software costs under SOP 98-1,
which are being amortized over expected useful lives, which range from 3 to 10&nbsp;years. These
capitalized amounts include internal costs of approximately $35.7&nbsp;million, $39.2&nbsp;million
and $15.9
million and external costs of approximately $29.4&nbsp;million, $65.5&nbsp;million and $41.5&nbsp;million for
fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These costs were incurred primarily in the
development of our proprietary software used in connection with our long-term client relationships.
The amortization of our internal use software is included in the amortization of computer software
in our depreciation and amortization expense as reflected in Note 8.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal year 2007, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge for in-process capitalized
software related to our Department of Education contract of approximately $76.4&nbsp;million (please see
Note 22 for further discussion), which included $12.7&nbsp;million capitalized in fiscal year 2007, and
which is included in the total amounts capitalized under SOP 98-1 above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;86, &#147;Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed&#148; (&#147;SFAS 86&#148;), certain costs
related to the development of software to be sold to our clients are capitalized upon reaching
technological feasibility and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. During
fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we capitalized approximately $27.6&nbsp;million, $31.6&nbsp;million and
$10.1&nbsp;million, respectively, in software costs under SFAS 86, which are being amortized over
expected useful lives, which range from 3 to 10&nbsp;years. These capitalized amounts include internal
costs of approximately $0.5&nbsp;million, $6.1&nbsp;million and $8.6&nbsp;million and external costs of
approximately $27.1&nbsp;million, $25.5&nbsp;million and $1.5&nbsp;million for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The amortization of software costs under SFAS 86 is included in the amortization of
computer software in our depreciation and amortization expense as reflected in Note 8.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of
our property, equipment and software may not be recoverable. Such evaluation is significantly
impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues, costs and expenses and other factors. If
an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the
value of our property, equipment and software, such revision could result in a non-cash impairment
charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.

future period amortization expense and possible expense we could incur as a result of an
impairment. The determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and
assumptions about future business trends and growth. In addition to our annual impairment testing,
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of
goodwill may not be recoverable. In evaluating impairment, we compare the estimated fair value of
the reporting unit to its underlying book value. Such evaluation is significantly impacted by
estimates and assumptions of future revenues, costs and expenses and other factors. If an event
occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of
our goodwill, such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material
impact on our financial results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other intangible assets consist primarily of acquired customer-related intangibles, and contract
and migration costs related to new business activity, both of which are recorded at cost and
amortized using the straight-line method over the contract terms. In connection with our revenue
arrangements, we incur costs to originate long-term contracts and to perform the transition and
setup activities necessary to enable us to perform under the terms of the arrangement. We
capitalize certain incremental direct costs which are related to the contract origination or
transition, implementation and setup activities and amortize them over the term of the arrangement.
From time to time, we also provide certain inducements to clients in the form of various
arrangements, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of
revenue over the term of the contract. The amortization period of customer-related intangible
assets ranges from 1 to 17&nbsp;years, with a weighted average of approximately 10&nbsp;years. The
amortization period for all other intangible assets, excluding title plants and tradenames with
indefinite useful lives, ranges from 1 to 20&nbsp;years, with a weighted average of 6&nbsp;years. For the
acquisitions in all periods presented except one immaterial acquisition in our Government segment
during fiscal year 2007, we obtained a third-party valuation of the intangible assets from Value
Incorporated. The determination of the value of other intangible assets requires us to make
estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth. In addition to our annual
impairment testing, we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that
indicate the balance of intangible assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating impairment, we
compare the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its underlying book value. Such
evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues, costs and
expenses and other factors. If an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and
assumptions used in analyzing the value of our other intangible assets, such revision could result
in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other assets primarily consist of long-term receivables, long-term investments related to our
deferred compensation plans (please see Note 10), long-term investments accounted for using the
cost and equity methods, long-term deposits and deferred debt issuance costs. It is our policy to
periodically review the net realizable value of our long-term receivables and investments through
an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of each receivable and investment. For
the investments related to our deferred compensation plans, we carry the assets at their fair
value, with changes in fair value included in our results of operations. Each investment is
reviewed to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which indicate that the
recoverability of the carrying amount may be uncertain. In the event that an investment is found to
be carried at an amount in excess of its recoverable amount, the asset would be adjusted for
impairment to a level commensurate with the

certain risks, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may hedge
material cash flow exposures using forward and/or option contracts. These instruments are
generally short-term in nature, with maturities of one year or less. Our derivative instruments
are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;133, &#145;&#145;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and

significant estimates or uncertainties. For example, transaction volumes and time and material and
cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific, objective criteria under the contracts.
Accordingly, revenues recognized under these methods do not require the use of significant
estimates that are susceptible to change. Revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion
accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our policy follows the guidance from SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148; (&#147;SAB
104&#148;), unless the transaction is within the scope of other specific authoritative guidance. SAB 104
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial

00-21&#148;). We recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services
have been provided to the client, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
reasonably assured.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal year 2007, approximately 74% of our revenue was recognized based on transaction
volumes, approximately 9% was fixed fee based, wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our
performance obligations under the arrangement, approximately 5% was related to cost reimbursable
contracts, approximately 5% of our revenue was recognized using percentage-of-completion accounting
and the remainder is related to time and material contracts. Our revenue mix is subject to change
due to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and new business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as
incurred, such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience. Revenues on
unit-price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and
accepted by the client. Revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual
rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues for business process outsourcing services are recognized as services are rendered,
generally on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed. Information technology
processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client, generally at the
contractual selling prices of resources consumed or capacity utilized by our clients. Revenues from
annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period.
Revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties
regarding customer acceptance have expired.

performance in accordance with the agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The percentage-of-completion methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable
revenue using the percentage of services completed, on a current cumulative cost to estimated total
cost basis, using a reasonably consistent profit margin over
the period. Due to the longer term nature of these projects, developing the estimates of costs
often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of
work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability
of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, and the
impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in
developing the estimates of costs or revenues, we revise our cost and revenue estimates, which may
result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such revisions are reflected in income
in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">EITF 00-21 addresses the accounting treatment for an arrangement to provide the delivery or
performance of multiple products and/or services where the delivery of a product or system or
performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time.
EITF 00-21 does not impact the use of SOP 81-1 for contract elements that fall within the scope of
SOP 81-1, such as the implementation or development of an information technology system to client
specifications under a long-term contract. Where an implementation or development project is
contracted with a client, and we will also provide services or operate the system over a period of
time, EITF 00-21 provides the methodology for separating the contract elements and allocating total
arrangement consideration to the contract elements but does not stipulate the revenue recognition
methodology that should be applied to these separate elements. In certain instances where revenue
cannot be allocated to a contract element delivered earlier than other elements, costs of delivery
are deferred and recognized as the subsequent elements are delivered. Costs deferred cannot exceed
the relative fair value of the related element. We adopted the provisions of EITF 00-21 on a
prospective basis for transactions entered into or modified after July&nbsp;1, 2003.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues earned in excess of related billings are accrued, whereas billings in excess of revenues
earned are deferred until the related services are provided. We recognize revenues for
non-refundable, upfront implementation fees on a straight-line basis over the period between the
initiation of the ongoing services through the end of the contract term.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We account for claims and contingencies in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;5, &#147;Accounting for
Contingencies&#148; (&#147;SFAS 5&#148;). SFAS 5 requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss
contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that
it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the
financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for claims
and contingencies requires us to use our judgment. We consult with legal counsel on those issues
related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the
ordinary course of business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our contracts with clients typically span several years. We continuously review and reassess our
estimates of contract profitability. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a
loss accrual is recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period it is first
identified. Circumstances that could potentially result in contract losses over the life of the
contract include decreases in volumes of transactions, variances from expected costs to deliver our
services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of
estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is
required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish
reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe
that certain positions may be challenged and that we may not succeed. We adjust these reserves in
light of changing facts and circumstances. Our provision for income taxes includes the impact of
these reserve changes. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized
in our operating results, the taxes attributable to that item would be separately calculated and
recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which such
differences are expected to reverse. We routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine
the likelihood of their realization. Please see Note 14 for a discussion of income taxes.

funded status of a plan are required to be recognized in the year in which the changes occur, and
reported in comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. Further, certain

requires the measurement date of the plan&#146;s funded status to be the same as the company&#146;s fiscal
year end. There was no change to our June

123(R) requires the company to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair
value method and recognize compensation cost in our financial statements. We adopted SFAS 123(R)
on a prospective basis beginning July&nbsp;1, 2005 for stock-based compensation awards granted after
that date and for unvested awards outstanding at that date using the modified prospective
application method. We recognize the fair value of stock-based compensation awards as wages and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The adoption of SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 resulted in prospective
changes in our accounting for stock-based compensation awards including recording stock-based
compensation expense and the related deferred income tax benefit on a prospective basis and
reflecting the excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation awards in cash
flows from financing activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in the recognition of compensation expense of $28&nbsp;million
($17.8&nbsp;million, net of deferred income tax benefits) and $35&nbsp;million ($22.9&nbsp;million, net of
deferred income tax benefits), $0.18 and $0.19 per basic share or $0.18 and $0.18 per diluted
share, in wages and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the fiscal years ended
June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In accordance with the modified prospective application
method of SFAS 123(R), prior period amounts have not been restated to reflect the recognition of
stock-based compensation costs as determined under SFAS 123. The total compensation cost related
to non-vested awards not yet recognized at June&nbsp;30, 2007 was approximately $68.1&nbsp;million, which is

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;7, 2007, our stockholders approved the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;2007 Equity Plan&#148;).
This plan is intended to replace our 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;1997 Stock Plan&#148;). Under the
2007 Equity Plan we have reserved 15&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock for issuance to key
employees at exercise prices determined by the Board of Directors or designated committee thereof.
Under our 1997 Stock Plan, we originally reserved approximately 7.4&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock for issuance to key employees at exercise prices determined by the Board of Directors
or designated committee thereof. In May&nbsp;2000, February&nbsp;2001, October&nbsp;2001, July&nbsp;2003, February
2005 and July&nbsp;2005, the Board of Directors approved the additional allotment of approximately 1.7
million, 1.6&nbsp;million, 4.1&nbsp;million, 3.8&nbsp;million, 2.7&nbsp;million and 0.8&nbsp;million shares, respectively,
to the 1997 Stock Plan in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 1997 Stock Plan
authorized by our shareholders pursuant to our November&nbsp;14, 1997 Proxy Statement. Options granted
under the 1997 Stock Plan to our current employees cannot exceed 12.8% of our issued and
outstanding shares, and consequently, any share repurchases (as discussed in Note 16) reduce the
number of options to purchase shares that we may grant under the 1997 Stock Plan. As of June&nbsp;7,
2007, the 1997 Stock Plan has been discontinued for new grants and as
a result, 1,521,736 unissued shares will expire as of December&nbsp;31, 2007. Our 1988 Stock Option Plan (the &#147;1988 Plan&#148;),
which originally reserved 12&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock for issuance, was discontinued
for new grants during fiscal year 1998 and terminated (except for the exercise of then existing
option grants as of September&nbsp;1997) and subsequently, 3.2&nbsp;million unissued shares expired.
Generally, the options under each plan vest in varying increments over a five-year period become
exercisable as they vest (please see discussion of the February&nbsp;2, 2005 amendment below) and expire
ten years from the date of grant. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, we had approximately 14,643,000 shares
available for issuance under the 2007 Equity Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
valuation model utilizing the assumptions noted below. The expected volatility of our stock price
is based on historical monthly volatility over the expected term based on daily closing stock
prices. The expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise
behavior, and the vesting term of the respective award and the contractual term of the respective
options. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are
considered separately for valuation purposes. Our stock price volatility and expected option lives
are based on management&#146;s best estimates at the time of grant, both of which impact the fair value
of the option calculated under the Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will
be recognized over the vesting term of the option. The weighted-average fair value of options
granted was $13.44 for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In order to conform our stock option program with standard market practice, on February&nbsp;2, 2005,
our Board of Directors approved an amendment to stock options previously granted that did not
become exercisable until five years from the date of grant to provide that such options become
exercisable on the day they vest. Options granted under both our 1997 Stock Plan and our 1988 Plan
generally vest in varying increments over a five year period. It is expected that future option
grants will contain matching vesting and exercise schedules, which we believe will result in a
lower expected term. This amendment does not amend or affect the vesting schedule, exercise price,
quantity of options granted, shares into which such options are exercisable or life of any award
under any outstanding option grant. Therefore, no compensation expense was recorded related to
this amendment; however, the expected term of the options decreased due to this amendment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2007, 2006 and 2005
was $20.2&nbsp;million, $66.2&nbsp;million and $66.5&nbsp;million, respectively, resulting in income tax benefits
of $7.3&nbsp;million, $23.9&nbsp;million and $20.1&nbsp;million, respectively. In addition, we also recorded
income tax benefits of $6.7&nbsp;million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 related to the
purchase of vested options from former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey A. Rich (please see Note 23
for further discussion).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">SFAS 123(R) requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of share-based
payment arrangements that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that
are based on historical employee termination behavior. We periodically adjust the estimated
forfeiture rates so that only the compensation expense related to share-based payment arrangements
that vest are included in wages and benefits. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from
those estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in
future periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We follow the transition method described in SFAS 123(R) for calculating the excess tax benefits
available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) (the
&#147;APIC Pool&#148;). Tax deficiencies arise when actual tax benefits we realize upon the exercise of stock
options are less than the recorded tax benefit. In November&nbsp;2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position FAS 123(R)-3, &#147;Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based
Payment Awards&#148; (&#147;FSP FAS 123(R)-3&#148;), which provides an alternative one-time transition election
for calculating the APIC Pool. We have elected not to utilize the one-time transition election
provided in FSP FAS 123(R)-3 and will instead follow the method described in SFAS 123(R).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
Under our 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#147;ESPP&#148;), a maximum of 4&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock can be issued to substantially all full-time employees who elect to participate. In
October&nbsp;2002, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the ESPP to increase the number of
shares that can be issued under the plan from 2&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million. Through payroll deductions,
eligible participants may purchase our stock at a 5% discount to market value. Prior to December
31, 2005, eligible participants were able to purchase our stock at a 15% discount to market value.
The stock is either purchased by the ESPP in the open market or issued from our treasury account,
or a combination of both. Our contributions for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2005, which were
charged to additional paid-in capital, were approximately $0.3&nbsp;million and $1&nbsp;million,
respectively. During fiscal year 2006 we expensed $1.4&nbsp;million related to our ESPP and funded
this liability through the issuance of treasury shares, resulting in a credit to additional
paid-in-capital of $1.3&nbsp;million. No expense was recorded in fiscal years 2007 and 2005 related to
our ESPP. During fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, in addition to stock purchased by the ESPP in
the open market, we issued approximately 57,000, 227,000 and 446,000 treasury shares, respectively,
to fund the issuance into the ESPP.

consideration of all strategic alternatives, including the proposal and all others received, in due

its review.

Darwin Deason and Cerberus to suspend the Exclusivity Agreement between Mr.
Deason and Cerberus so that the Company, under the direction of the Special
Committee of independent directors, can conduct a process to consider the sale of the Company that
it considers to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.

charges and asset impairments arising from our discretionary decisions. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007,
approximately 2,500 employees have been involuntarily terminated as a result of these initiatives,

with this assessment, we recorded restructuring charges for involuntary termination of employees
related to the closure of those duplicative facilities or locations of $6.5&nbsp;million and $5.5
million for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is reflected in wages and
benefits in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and $2.4&nbsp;million and $4.7&nbsp;million for the years
ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for impairments of duplicative technology equipment and
facility costs, facility shutdown and other costs, which are reflected as part of total operating
expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We plan to further penetrate offshore labor
markets. We expect these activities will consolidate our global production activities and enhance
our competitive position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our Government segment, we began an assessment of our competitive position, evaluated our market
strategies and the technology used to support certain of our service offerings. We began to
implement operating practices that we utilize in our Commercial segment, including leveraging our
proprietary workflow technology and implementing activity based compensation, which is expected to
reduce our operating costs and enhance our competitive position. In connection with these
activities, we recorded restructuring charges for involuntary termination of employees of $0.7
million and $1&nbsp;million for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is reflected
in wages and benefits in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In fiscal year 2007, we recorded
$0.5&nbsp;million of costs related to the consolidation of solution development groups within the
Government segment, which is reflected in total operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements
of Income. In fiscal year 2006, we recorded $1.6&nbsp;million for asset impairment and other charges,
principally for duplicative software as a result of recent acquisition activity, which is reflected
in total operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As discussed in Note 6, we
completed the WWS Divestiture, which allows us to focus on our technology-enabled business process
outsourcing and information technology service offerings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
In December&nbsp;2005, we completed the divestiture of substantially all of our Government
welfare-to-workforce services business (the &#147;WWS Divestiture&#148;) to Arbor E&#038;T, LLC (&#147;Arbor&#148;), a
wholly owned subsidiary of ResCare, Inc., for approximately $69&nbsp;million, less transaction costs.
Assets sold were approximately $31.6&nbsp;million and liabilities assumed by Arbor were approximately
$0.2&nbsp;million, both of which were included in the Government segment. We retained the net working
capital related to the WWS Divestiture. We recognized a pretax gain of $2.5&nbsp;million ($1.5&nbsp;million,
net of income tax) and $33.5&nbsp;million ($20.1&nbsp;million, net of income tax) during fiscal years 2007
and 2006, respectively, upon the assignment of customer contracts to Arbor. The after tax proceeds
from the divestiture were primarily used for general corporate purposes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from the WWS Divestiture were $0.9&nbsp;million, $104.2&nbsp;million and $218&nbsp;million for fiscal
years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating (loss)&nbsp;income from the WWS Divestiture,
excluding the gain on sale, was ($0.6&nbsp;million), $6.4&nbsp;million and $11.5&nbsp;million for fiscal years
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Fiscal year 2006 operating loss included the following: a
provision for estimated litigation settlement related to the WWS Divestiture; and a provision for
uncollectible accounts receivable due to a change in our estimate of collectibility of the retained
outstanding receivables. Total provisions recorded in fiscal year 2006 were $3.3&nbsp;million ($2.1
million, net of income tax).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we completed the sale of a subsidiary related to
operations of the WWS Divestiture and recorded a loss on the sale of approximately $0.6&nbsp;million
($1.0&nbsp;million, net of income tax) and related charges of $0.2&nbsp;million ($0.1&nbsp;million, net of income
tax).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The welfare-to-workforce services business is no longer strategic or core to our operating
philosophy. These divestitures allow us to focus on our technology-enabled business process
outsourcing and information technology service offerings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At June&nbsp;30, 2006, we classified as assets held for sale certain customer contracts related to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Amortization includes amounts charged to amortization expense for customer contract costs and other
intangibles, other than contract inducements. Amortization of contract inducements of $14.6
million, $15.3&nbsp;million and $14.3&nbsp;million for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is
recorded as a reduction to related contract revenue. Amortization for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and
2005 includes approximately $42.4&nbsp;million, $37.4&nbsp;million and $27.7&nbsp;million, respectively, related
to acquired customer-related intangible assets. Amortization expense includes approximately $22.6
million, $18.7&nbsp;million and $15.7&nbsp;million for customer-related and all other intangibles for fiscal
years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over the
related contract term. The amortization period of customer-related intangible assets ranges from 1
to 17&nbsp;years, with a weighted average of approximately 10&nbsp;years. The amortization period for all
other intangible assets, including trademarks, ranges from 1 to 20&nbsp;years, with a weighted average

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
On March&nbsp;20, 2006, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the &#147;Credit
Agreement&#148;) with Citicorp USA, Inc., as Administrative Agent (&#147;Citicorp&#148;), Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., as Sole Lead Arranger and Book Runner, and with Morgan Stanley Bank, SunTrust Bank, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Wachovia Bank National Association, Bank of America, N.A., Bear Stearns
Corporate Lending and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Co-Syndication Agents, and various other lenders
and issuers (the &#147;Credit Facility&#148;). The Credit Facility provides for a senior secured term loan
facility of $1.8&nbsp;billion, with the ability to increase it by up to $2&nbsp;billion (as of June&nbsp;30,
2007), under certain circumstances (the &#147;Term Loan Facility&#148;) and a senior secured revolving credit
facility of $1&nbsp;billion with the ability to increase it by up to $750&nbsp;million (the &#147;Revolving
Facility&#148;), each of which is described more fully below. At the closing of the Credit Facility, we
and certain of our subsidiaries jointly borrowed approximately $800&nbsp;million under the Term Loan
Facility and approximately $93&nbsp;million under the Revolving Facility. We used the proceeds of the
Term Loan Facility to (i)&nbsp;refinance approximately $278&nbsp;million in outstanding indebtedness under
our 5-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of October&nbsp;27, 2004
(the &#147;Prior Facility&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;finance the purchase of shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock tendered in
the Company&#146;s &#147;Dutch Auction&#148; tender which expired March&nbsp;17, 2006 (as extended) and (iii)&nbsp;for the
payment of transaction costs, fees and expenses related to the Credit Facility and Dutch Auction.
As a result of the refinancing of the Prior Facility, we wrote off approximately $4.1&nbsp;million in
debt issue costs, which was included in other non-operating income, net. A portion of the proceeds
of the Revolving Facility were used to refinance approximately $73&nbsp;million in outstanding
indebtedness under the Prior Facility. The remainder of the proceeds of the Revolving Facility were
used for working capital purposes and to fund our share repurchase programs. In addition,
approximately $114&nbsp;million of letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility to replace
letters of credit outstanding under the Prior Facility. The Prior Facility was terminated on March
20, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;6, 2006, we amended our Term Loan Facility. We borrowed an additional $500&nbsp;million on July
6, 2006 and an additional $500&nbsp;million on August&nbsp;1, 2006. As a result of the increase to the
facility, the Applicable Margin, as defined in the Credit Facility, increased to LIBOR plus 200
basis points. We used the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility increase to finance the purchase of
shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock under the June&nbsp;2006 $1&nbsp;billion share repurchase authorization
and for the payment of transaction costs, fees and expenses related to the increase in the Term
Loan Facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility mature on March&nbsp;20, 2013, and will amortize in
quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount
of the loans advanced, with the balance payable on the final maturity date. Amounts borrowed under
the Term Loan Facility may also be repaid at any time at our discretion. Interest on the
outstanding balances under the Term Loan Facility is payable, at our option, at a rate equal to the
Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus the fluctuating Base Rate (as defined in
the Credit Facility), or at the Applicable Margin plus the current LIBOR (as defined in the Credit
Facility). The borrowing rate on the Term Loan Facility at June&nbsp;30, 2007 was 7.32%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Proceeds borrowed under the Revolving Facility will be used as needed for general corporate
purposes and to fund share repurchase programs. Amounts under the Revolving Facility are available
on a revolving basis until the maturity date of March&nbsp;20, 2012. The Revolving Facility allows for
borrowings up to the full amount of the revolver in either U.S. Dollars or Euros. Up to the U.S.
dollar equivalent of $200&nbsp;million may be borrowed in other currencies, including Sterling, Canadian
Dollars, Australian Dollars, Yen, Francs, Krones and New Zealand Dollars. Portions of the
Revolving Facility are available for issuances of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $700&nbsp;million
of letters of credit and for borrowings of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $150&nbsp;million of
swing loans. Interest on outstanding balances under the Revolving Facility is payable, at our
option, at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin plus the fluctuating Base Rate, or at the
Applicable Margin plus the current LIBOR for the applicable currency. The borrowing rate under the
Revolving Facility at June&nbsp;30, 2007 ranges from 3.87% to 5.37%, depending upon the currency of the
outstanding borrowings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Credit Facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature of up to $750&nbsp;million in the
aggregate allowing for future incremental borrowings under the Revolving Facility, which may be
used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility also includes an additional uncommitted
accordion feature of up to $2&nbsp;billion (as of June&nbsp;30, 2007) allowing for future incremental
borrowings under the Term Loan Facility which may be used to fund additional purchases of our
equity securities or for extinguishment of our Senior Notes (defined below). The Term Loan
Facility accordion expires on March&nbsp;20, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic
subsidiaries and certain of our foreign subsidiaries (but only to the extent such guarantees would
not result in materially adverse tax consequences). In addition, Credit Facility obligations are
secured under certain pledge agreements by (i)&nbsp;a first priority perfected pledge of all notes owned
by us and the guarantors and the capital stock of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries
and certain of our foreign subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions, including to the extent the
pledge would give rise to additional SEC reporting requirements for our subsidiaries or result in
materially adverse tax consequences), and (ii)&nbsp;a first priority perfected security interest in all
other assets owned by us and the guarantors, subject to customary exceptions. As required under the
indentures governing our outstanding Senior Notes, we have granted equal and ratable liens in favor
of the holders of the Senior Notes in all assets discussed above, other than the accounts
receivable of the Company and our subsidiaries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Among other fees, we pay a commitment fee (payable quarterly) based on the amount of unused
commitments under the Revolving Facility (not including the uncommitted accordion feature discussed
above). The commitment fee payable at June&nbsp;30, 2007 was 0.375% of the unused commitment. We also
pay fees with respect to any letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. Letter of credit
fees at June&nbsp;30, 2007 were 1.35% of the currently issued and outstanding letters of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including but not limited to, restrictions on our
ability, and in certain instances, our subsidiaries&#146; ability, to incur liens, merge or dissolve,
make certain restricted payments, or sell or transfer assets. The Credit Facility also limits the
Company&#146;s and our subsidiaries&#146; ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, based upon
the total amount advanced under the Term Loan Facility at June&nbsp;30, 2007, we may not permit our
consolidated total leverage ratio to exceed 4.00 to 1.00, nor permit our consolidated senior
leverage ratio to exceed 3.00 to 1.00, nor permit our consolidated interest coverage ratio to be
less than 4.50 to 1.0 during specified periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the Credit Facility may be
accelerated and the lending commitments under the Credit Facility terminated. Such events of
default include, but are not limited to, payment default to lenders, material inaccuracies of
representations and warranties, covenant defaults, material payment defaults with respect to
indebtedness or guaranty obligations, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material
money judgments, material ERISA events, or change of control of the Company. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007,
we were in compliance with the covenants of our Credit Facility, as amended.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At June&nbsp;30, 2007, we had approximately $834.7&nbsp;million available on our Revolving Facility after
giving effect to outstanding indebtedness of $52.1&nbsp;million and $113.2&nbsp;million of outstanding
letters of credit that secure certain contractual performance and other obligations and which
reduce the availability of our Revolving Facility. At June&nbsp;30, 2007, we had $1.8&nbsp;billion

On June&nbsp;6, 2005, we completed a public offering of $250&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of 4.70%
Senior Notes due June&nbsp;1, 2010 and $250&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% Senior Notes due
June&nbsp;1, 2015 (collectively, the &#147;Senior Notes&#148;). Interest on the Senior Notes is payable
semiannually. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $496&nbsp;million, after deducting
underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding
balance of our Prior Facility. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time prior to
maturity, which may include prepayment penalties determined according to pre-established criteria.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On September&nbsp;22, 2006, we received a letter from CEDE &#038; Co. (&#147;CEDE&#148;) sent on behalf of certain
holders of our 5.20% Senior Notes due 2015 (the &#147;5.20% Senior Notes&#148;) issued by us under that
certain Indenture dated June&nbsp;6, 2005 (the &#147;Indenture&#148;) between us and the Trustee advising us that
we were in default of our covenants. The letter alleged that our failure to timely file our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 by September&nbsp;13, 2006, was a default under
the terms of the Indenture. On September&nbsp;29, 2006, we received a letter from CEDE sent on behalf of
the same persons declaring an acceleration with respect to the 5.20% Senior Notes, as a result of
our failure to remedy the purported default set forth in the September&nbsp;22, 2006 letter related to
our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2006. The
September&nbsp;29, 2006 letter declared that the principal amount and premium, if any, and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on the 5.20% Senior Notes were due and payable immediately, and demanded
payment of all amounts owed in respect of the 5.20% Senior Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On September&nbsp;29, 2006 we received a letter from the Trustee with respect to the 5.20% Senior Notes.
The letter alleged that we were in default of our covenants under the Indenture with respect to the
5.20% Senior Notes, as the result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 on or before September&nbsp;28, 2006. On October&nbsp;6, 2006, we received a
letter from the Trustee declaring an acceleration with respect to the 5.20% Senior Notes as a
result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending June&nbsp;30,
2006 on or before September&nbsp;28, 2006. The October&nbsp;6, 2006 letter declared the principal amount and
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the 5.20% Senior Notes to be due and
payable immediately, and demanded payment of all amounts owed in respect of the 5.20% Senior Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, our 4.70% Senior Notes due 2010 (the &#147;4.70% Senior Notes&#148;) were also issued under the
Indenture and have identical default and acceleration provisions as the 5.20% Senior Notes. On
October&nbsp;9, 2006, we received letters from certain holders of the 4.70% Senior Notes issued by us
under the Indenture, advising us that we were in default of our covenants under the Indenture. The
letters alleged that our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period
ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 by September&nbsp;13, 2006, was a default under the terms of the Indenture. On
November&nbsp;9, 10 and 16, 2006, we received letters from CEDE sent on behalf of certain holders of our
4.70% Senior Notes, declaring an acceleration of the 4.70% Senior Notes as the result of our
failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006. The
November&nbsp;9, 10 and 16, 2006 letters declared the principal amount and premium, if any, and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, on the 4.70% Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately, and
demanded payment of all amounts owed under the 4.70% Senior Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">It is our position that no default has occurred under the Indenture and that no acceleration has
occurred with respect to the 5.20% Senior Notes or the 4.70% Senior Notes or otherwise under the
Indenture. Further we have filed a lawsuit against the Trustee in the United States District Court,
Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, seeking a declaratory judgment affirming our position.
On January&nbsp;8, 2007, the Court entered an order substituting Wilmington Trust Company for the
Trustee. On January&nbsp;16, 2007, Wilmington Trust Company filed an answer and counterclaim. The
counterclaim seeks immediate payment of all principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior
Notes. Alternatively, the counterclaim seeks damages measured by the difference between the fair
market value of the Senior Notes on or about September&nbsp;22, 2006 and par value of the Senior Notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Unless and until there is a final judgment rendered in the lawsuit described above (including any
appellate proceedings), no legally enforceable determination can be made as to whether the failure
to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 is a default
under the Indenture as alleged by the letters referenced above. If there is a final legally
enforceable determination that the failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
period ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 is a default under the Indenture, and that acceleration with respect to
the Senior Notes was proper, the principal and premium, if any and all accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, on the Senior Notes would be immediately due and payable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the event the claim of default against us made by certain holders of the Senior Notes is upheld
in a court of law and we are required to pay off the Senior Notes, it is most likely that we would
utilize the Credit Facility to fund such payoff. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we can
utilize borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain liquidity requirements,
or may seek additional commitments for funding under the Term Loan Facility of the Credit Facility.
We estimate we have sufficient liquidity to meet both the needs of our operations and any
potential payoff of the Senior Notes.

Section&nbsp;162(m) deduction disallowance
discussed in Note 21. The increase in cash payments for interest during fiscal year 2007 was
primarily due to higher borrowings on our Term Credit Facility and

employees. On June&nbsp;30, 2007, we adopted SFAS 158. This Statement requires recognition of the
funded status of a defined benefit plan in the statement of financial position as an asset or
liability if the plan is overfunded or underfunded, respectively. Changes in the funded status of a
plan are required to be recognized in the year in which the changes occur, and reported in
comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. Further, certain gains and
losses that were not previously recognized in the financial statements are required to be reported
in comprehensive income, and certain disclosure requirements were changed. SFAS 158 also requires
the measurement date of the plan&#146;s funded status to be the same as the company&#146;s fiscal year end.
There was no change to our June&nbsp;30 measurement date as a result of the adoption of SFAS 158.
Adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
of approximately $2.4&nbsp;million, net of $1.0&nbsp;million deferred income tax.

Acquired HR Business has both a funded basic pension plan and an unfunded excess pension plan. The
UK pension scheme is a funded plan. These defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating
employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period before
retirement. We established June&nbsp;30 as our measurement date for these defined benefit plans. The net

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We estimate the long-term rate of return on UK, Canadian and U.S. plan assets will be 6.5%, 7% and
8%, respectively, based on the long-term target asset allocation. Expected returns for the
following asset classes used in the plans are based on a combination of long-term historical
returns and current and expected market conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The UK pension scheme&#146;s target asset allocation is 50% equity securities, 40% debt securities and
10% in real estate. External investment managers actively manage all of the asset classes. The
target asset allocation has been set by the plan&#146;s trustee board with a view to meeting the
long-term return assumed for setting the employer&#146;s contributions while also reducing volatility
relative to the plan&#146;s liabilities. The managers engaged by the trustees manage their assets with
a view to seeking moderate out-performance of appropriate benchmarks for each asset class. At this
time, the trustees do not engage in any alternative investment strategies, apart from UK commercial
property.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Canadian funded plan&#146;s target asset allocation is 35% Canadian provincial and corporate bonds,
30% larger capitalization Canadian stocks, 30% developed and larger capitalization Global ex Canada
stocks (mainly U.S. and international stocks) and 5% cash and cash equivalents. A single
investment manager actively manages all of the asset classes. This manager uses an equal blend of
large cap value and large cap growth for stocks in order to participate in the returns generated by
stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. The bonds are managed using a
core approach where multiple strategies are engaged such as interest rate anticipation, credit
selection and yield curve positioning to mitigate overall risk. At this time, the manager does not
engage in any alternative investment strategies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The U.S. pension plan&#146;s target asset allocation is 30% large capitalization U.S. equities, 5% small
capitalization U.S. equities, 25% developed market non-U.S. equities, 30% long duration U.S.
Treasury bonds and 10% in alternative investments. The asset allocation was set considering asset
class expected returns and volatility relative to the duration of the liabilities of the pension plan.

measure the expected cost of benefits covered. For measurement purposes, a 7.8% composite annual
rate of increase in the per capita costs of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for fiscal year

thereafter. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption may have a significant effect on the SFAS

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;1998, we entered into a Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Deason,
which was amended in August&nbsp;2003 to conform the normal retirement date specified therein to our
fiscal year end next succeeding the termination of the Employment Agreement between Mr.&nbsp;Deason and
us. The normal retirement date under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement was
subsequently amended in June&nbsp;2005 to conform to the termination date of the Employment Agreement
with the exception of the determination of any amount deferred in taxable years prior to January&nbsp;1,
2005 for purposes of applying the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the
regulations and interpretive guidance published pursuant thereto (the &#147;AJCA&#148;). Pursuant to the
Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement, which was reviewed and approved by the Board of
Directors, Mr.&nbsp;Deason will receive a benefit upon the occurrence of certain events equal to an
actuarially calculated amount based on a percentage of his average monthly compensation determined
by his monthly compensation during the highest thirty-six consecutive calendar months from among
the 120 consecutive calendar months ending on the earlier of his termination of employment or his
normal retirement date. The amount of this benefit payable by us will be offset by the value of
particular options granted to Mr.&nbsp;Deason (including 150,000 shares covered by options granted in
October&nbsp;1998 with an exercise price of $11.53 per share and 300,000 shares granted in August&nbsp;2003
with an exercise price of $44.10). To the extent that we determine that our estimated actuarial
liability under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement exceeds the &#147;in the money&#148; value of
such options, such deficiency would be reflected in our results of operations as of the date of
such determination. In the event that the value of the options granted to Mr.&nbsp;Deason exceeds the
benefit, such excess benefit would accrue to Mr.&nbsp;Deason and we would have no further obligation
under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement. The percentage applied to the average
monthly compensation is 56% for benefit determinations made on or any time after May&nbsp;18, 2005. The
events triggering the benefit are retirement, total and permanent disability, death, resignation,
and change in control or termination for any reason other

installments over a period not to exceed ten years. We estimate that our obligation with respect
to Mr.&nbsp;Deason under the Supplemental Executive Retirement
Agreement was approximately $9.1 million at June
30, 2007. The value (the excess of the market price over the option exercise price) of the options
at June&nbsp;30, 2007 was $10.6&nbsp;million. If the payment is caused by a change in control and at such
time Mr.&nbsp;Deason would be subject to an excise tax under the Code with respect to the benefit, the
amount of the benefit will be grossed-up to offset this tax.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At June&nbsp;30, 2007, we had available unused domestic net operating loss carryforwards (&#147;NOLs&#148;), net
of Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;382 limitations, of approximately $98.7&nbsp;million which will expire
over various periods from 2010 through 2024. We also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $9.3&nbsp;million, all of which have indefinite lives. The change in tax credits and
loss carryforwards from June&nbsp;30, 2006 to June&nbsp;30, 2007 is primarily due to current year usage of
net operating losses. A valuation allowance of $17.2&nbsp;million and $14.6&nbsp;million was recorded at June
30, 2007 and June&nbsp;30, 2006, respectively, against deferred tax assets associated with net operating
losses and tax credit carryforwards for which realization of any future benefit is uncertain due to
taxable income limitations. We routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the
likelihood of their realization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The depreciation and amortization related deferred tax liabilities changed during the years ended
June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006 predominantly due to current tax deductions for acquired intangibles and
depreciation. Generally, since the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangibles,&#148;
eliminates the book goodwill amortization, the difference between the cumulative book and tax bases
of goodwill will continue to change as current tax deductions are realized. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007
and June&nbsp;30, 2006, the amount of deductible goodwill was approximately $2.1&nbsp;billion and $2.0
billion, respectively.

the amounts of estimated taxes, penalties and interest. This payment is reflected in cash flows
from operating activities at June&nbsp;30, 2007. During fiscal year 2007, we reversed approximately $6
million of accrued income taxes, penalties and interest associated with Section 162(m) issues
attributable to factors unrelated to revised measurement dates as we believe an accrual for these
amounts is no longer required. Please see Note 21 for further discussion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June and August&nbsp;2006, our Board of Directors authorized two share repurchase programs of up to
$1&nbsp;billion each of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. The programs, which are open ended, allow us to
repurchase our shares on the open market, from time to time, in accordance with the requirements of
the SEC rules and regulations, including shares that could be purchased pursuant to SEC Rule
10b5-1. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the
level of cash and debt balances, general business conditions, and other factors, including
alternative investment opportunities. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, we had repurchased approximately 19.9
million shares under the June&nbsp;2006 authorization at an average cost of approximately $50.30 per
share (approximately $1&nbsp;billion) all of which have been retired. A total of 14.4&nbsp;million shares
with an average cost of approximately $50.64 per share (approximately $730.7&nbsp;million) were
purchased and retired in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. No repurchases have been made
under the August&nbsp;2006 authorization as of the date of this filing. If any additional repurchases
are made, such repurchases would be funded from borrowings under our Credit Facility.

repurchase programs totaling $1.75&nbsp;billion of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. On September&nbsp;2, 2003, we
announced that our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500&nbsp;million
of our Class&nbsp;A common stock; on April&nbsp;29, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized
a new, incremental share repurchase program of up to $750&nbsp;million of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, and

were terminated on January&nbsp;25, 2006 by our Board of  Directors in contemplation of our Tender Offer,
which was announced January&nbsp;26, 2006 and expired March&nbsp;17, 2006. The programs, which were
open-ended, allowed us to repurchase our shares on the open market from time to time in accordance
with SEC rules and regulations, including shares that could be purchased pursuant to SEC Rule
10b5-1. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases was based on the level of cash
and debt balances, general business conditions and other factors, including alternative investment
opportunities, and purchases under these plans were funded from various sources, including, but not
limited to, cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under our credit facilities.
Under our previously authorized share repurchase programs during
fiscal years 2006 and 2005,
we had repurchased approximately 2.2&nbsp;million and
4.9&nbsp;million shares, respectively, at a
total cost of approximately $115.8&nbsp;million and $250.8&nbsp;million, respectively. We
reissued approximately 0.3&nbsp;million and 0.6&nbsp;million shares, respectively, for proceeds
of approximately $17.9&nbsp;million and $28.5&nbsp;million, respectively, to fund contributions
to our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan during fiscal
years 2006 and 2005,
respectively. In fiscal year 2007, we reissued approximately 57,000 treasury shares for proceeds
totaling approximately $2.8&nbsp;million to fund contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Stock options grants</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;15, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted 2,091,500 options
to employees under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan. Based on executive management&#146;s recommendation,
no stock option grants were made to corporate executive management pending substantive
determination regarding corporate executive management&#146;s actions in the matters related to the
stock option investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the grand jury subpoena
issued by the United States District Court, Southern District of New York. However, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors agreed to grant options of 100,000 shares each to
Ann Vezina, Chief Operating Officer, Commercial Solutions Group and Tom Burlin, Chief Operating
Officer, Government Solutions Group, but those grants were deferred. The delay in the grants to
Ms.&nbsp;Vezina and Mr.&nbsp;Burlin was necessary at the time because there were insufficient shares
remaining in the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan to make the grants to Ms.&nbsp;Vezina and Mr.&nbsp;Burlin.
Subsequent to August&nbsp;15, 2006, there were a number of options granted under the 1997 Stock
Incentive Plan that terminated, which options then became available to grant to other employees,
including Ms.&nbsp;Vezina and Mr.&nbsp;Burlin as discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the ongoing stock option investigation (please see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements), we were unable to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June&nbsp;30, 2006 and our Annual Meeting of Stockholders was delayed, and the regularly scheduled
meeting of our Board of Directors that was to have occurred in November&nbsp;2006 was focused solely on
stock option investigation matters and any other matters for consideration were deferred. Under
our stock option granting policy, the day prior to or the day of that regularly scheduled November
Board meeting, the Compensation Committee could have granted options to new hires, employees
receiving a grant in connection with a promotion, or persons who become ACS employees as a result
of an acquisition. On the morning of December&nbsp;9, 2006 the Compensation Committee met to discuss
whether options, that were available under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan should be granted to new
hires, employees receiving a grant in connection with a promotion, or persons who became ACS
employees as a result of an acquisition. After consideration of the fact that options would have
been granted in November, if the regularly scheduled Board meeting had not deferred consideration
of matters other than the stock option investigation, the Compensation Committee granted 692,000
shares to new hires, employees receiving a grant in connection with a promotion, or persons who
become ACS employees as a result of an acquisition, with such grants including 140,000 shares to
Lynn Blodgett, who had been promoted to President and Chief Executive Officer; 75,000 shares to
John Rexford who had been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and
100,000 shares each to Ann Vezina and Tom Burlin which grants were in recognition of their recent
promotions to Chief Operating Officers of the Commercial and Government segments, respectively, and
had been approved by the Compensation Committee on August&nbsp;15, 2006 but were deferred until shares
were available for grant.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;26, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a modified &#147;Dutch Auction&#148;
tender offer to purchase up to 55.5&nbsp;million shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock at a price per share
not less than $56 and not greater than $63 (the &#147;Tender Offer&#148;). The Tender Offer commenced on
February&nbsp;9, 2006, and expired on March&nbsp;17, 2006 (as extended), and was funded with proceeds from
the Term Loan Facility. Our directors and executive officers, including our Chairman, Darwin
Deason, did not tender shares pursuant to the Tender Offer. The number of shares purchased in the
Tender Offer was 7,365,110 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock at an average price of $63 per share plus
transaction costs, for an aggregate purchase amount of $475.9&nbsp;million. All of the shares
purchased in the Tender Offer were retired as of June&nbsp;30, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Voting Rights of Our Chairman</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the Tender Offer, Mr.&nbsp;Deason entered into a Voting Agreement with the Company
dated February&nbsp;9, 2006 (the &#147;Voting Agreement&#148;) in which he agreed to limit his ability to cause
the additional voting power he would hold as a result of the Tender Offer to affect the outcome of
any matter submitted to the vote of the stockholders of the Company after consummation of the
Tender Offer. Mr.&nbsp;Deason agreed that to the extent his voting power immediately after the Tender
Offer increased above the percentage amount of his voting power immediately prior to the Tender
Offer, Mr.&nbsp;Deason would cause the shares representing such additional voting power (the &#147;Excess
Voting Power&#148;) to appear, not appear, vote or not vote at any meeting or pursuant to any consent
solicitation in the same manner, and in proportion to, the votes or actions of all stockholders
including Mr.&nbsp;Deason whose Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B shares shall, solely for the purpose of
proportionality, be counted on a one for one vote basis (even though the Class&nbsp;B shares have ten
votes per share).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As the result of the purchase of approximately 7.4&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in the
Tender Offer, Mr.&nbsp;Deason&#146;s percentage increase in voting power above the percentage amount of his
voting power immediately prior to the Tender Offer was approximately 1.5%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Voting Agreement will have no effect on shares representing the approximately 36.7% voting
power of the Company held by Mr.&nbsp;Deason prior to the Tender Offer, which Mr.&nbsp;Deason will continue
to have the right to vote in his sole discretion, or on any increase in his voting percentage as a
result of any share repurchases by the Company. The Voting Agreement also does not apply to any
Class&nbsp;A shares that Mr.&nbsp;Deason may acquire after the Tender Offer through his exercise of stock
options, open market purchases or in any future transaction that we may undertake (including any
increase in voting power related to any Company share repurchase program). Other than as expressly
set forth in the Voting Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Deason continues to have the power to exercise all rights
attached to the shares he owns, including the right to dispose of his shares and the right to
receive any distributions thereon.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Voting Agreement will terminate on the earliest of (i)&nbsp;the mutual agreement of the Company
(authorized by not less than a majority of the vote of the then independent and disinterested
directors) and Mr.&nbsp;Deason, (ii)&nbsp;the date on which Mr.&nbsp;Deason ceases to hold any Excess Voting
Power, as calculated in the Voting Agreement, or (iii)&nbsp;the date on which all Class&nbsp;B shares are
converted into Class&nbsp;A shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Mr.&nbsp;Deason and a special committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of independent
directors, have not reached an agreement regarding the fair compensation to be paid to Mr.&nbsp;Deason
for entering into the Voting Agreement. However, whether or not Mr.&nbsp;Deason and our special
committee are able to reach agreement on compensation to be paid to Mr.&nbsp;Deason, the Voting
Agreement will remain in effect.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Additional dilution from assumed exercises of stock options is dependent upon several factors,
including the market price of our common stock. During fiscal year 2007, 2006 and 2005, options to
purchase approximately 6,019,000, 5,136,000, and 1,075,000 shares of common stock, respectively,
were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
average market price of the underlying stock did not exceed the sum of the option exercise price,
unrecognized compensation expense and the windfall tax benefit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The calculation of diluted earnings per share requires us to make certain assumptions related to
the use of proceeds that would be received upon the assumed exercise of stock options. These
assumed proceeds include the excess tax benefits that we receive upon assumed exercises. We
calculate the assumed proceeds from excess tax benefits based on the deferred tax assets actually
recorded without consideration of &#147;as if&#148; deferred tax assets calculated under the provisions of
SFAS 123(R).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We hedge the variability of a portion of our anticipated future Mexican peso cash flows through
foreign exchange forward agreements. The agreements are designated as cash flow hedges of
forecasted payments related to certain operating costs of our Mexican operations. As of June&nbsp;30,
2007 and 2006, the notional amount of these agreements totaled 312&nbsp;million pesos (approximately
$27.9&nbsp;million) and 217.5&nbsp;million pesos (approximately $19.5&nbsp;million), respectively. These
agreements expire at various dates over the next 12&nbsp;months. Upon termination of these agreements,
we will purchase Mexican pesos at the exchange rates specified in the forward agreements to be used
for payments on our forecasted Mexican peso operating costs. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, the unrealized
gain on these foreign exchange forward agreements, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss), net, was $0.6&nbsp;million ($0.4&nbsp;million, net of income tax), and the fair market value
of $0.6&nbsp;million is reflected in other current assets. As of June&nbsp;30, 2006, the unrealized loss on
these foreign exchange forward agreements, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss), net, was $0.5&nbsp;million ($0.3&nbsp;million, net of income tax) and the fair market value of $0.5

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As part of the Transport Revenue acquisition, we acquired foreign exchange forward agreements that
hedge our French operation&#146;s Euro foreign exchange exposure related to its Canadian dollar and
U.S. dollar revenues. These agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS
133. As a result, we recorded a gain on hedging instruments of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million ($1.1
million, net of income tax) for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2006 in other non-operating income, net in
our Consolidated Statements of Income. The gain on hedging instruments was not material in fiscal
year 2007. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, the notional amount of these agreements totaled 25.2
million Euros (approximately $33.9&nbsp;million) and 31.2&nbsp;million Euros (approximately $39.1&nbsp;million),
respectively, and are set to expire at various times over the next four years. A liability was
recorded for the related fair value of approximately
$4.3&nbsp;million and $4.1&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In order to hedge the variability of future interest payments related to our Senior Notes issuance,
we entered into forward interest rate agreements in April&nbsp;2005. The agreements were designated as
cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments in anticipation of the issuance of the Senior
Notes. The notional amount of the agreements totaled $500&nbsp;million and the agreements were
terminated in June&nbsp;2005 upon issuance of the Senior Notes. The settlement of the forward interest
rate agreements of $19&nbsp;million ($12&nbsp;million, net of income tax) was recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), net, and will be amortized as an increase in reported interest expense
over the term of the Senior Notes, with approximately $2.5&nbsp;million to be amortized over the next 12
months. During fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we amortized approximately $2.5&nbsp;million, $2.5
million and $0.2&nbsp;million, respectively, to interest expense. The amount of gain or loss related to
hedge ineffectiveness was not material.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In
March&nbsp;2007, we entered into a five-year amortizing interest rate
swap agreement. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, the notional amount of the
agreement totaled $700&nbsp;million. The agreement
is designated as a cash flow hedge of forecasted interest payments on
up to $700&nbsp;million outstanding floating rate debt under
our Credit Facility. The interest rate swap is structured such that we pay a fixed rate of
interest of 4.897%, and receive a floating rate of interest based on
one month LIBOR. The fair value of the
agreement of $8.1&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2007 reflects termination cash value. The unrealized gain of
$8.1&nbsp;million ($5.3&nbsp;million, net of income tax), was reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss), net. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, the fair market value
of $8.1&nbsp;million is reflected in
other assets.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;3, 2006, we received notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was
conducting an investigation into certain stock option grants made by us from October&nbsp;1998 through
March&nbsp;2005. On June&nbsp;7, 2006 and on June&nbsp;16, 2006, we received requests from the SEC for
information on all of our stock option grants since 1994. We have been providing supplemental
information to the SEC on a voluntary basis following the initial SEC
requests. Subsequent to May&nbsp;10,
2007, the date of our last quarterly filing with the Commission, the Company has learned that the
SEC obtained a formal order of investigation in this matter in August&nbsp;2006. We are continuing to
cooperate with the SEC&#146;s investigation.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;17, 2006, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States District Court, Southern
District of New York, requesting production of documents related to granting of our stock option
grants. We have responded to the grand jury subpoena and have provided documents to the United
States Attorney&#146;s Office in connection with the grand jury proceeding. We have informed the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney&#146;s Office for the Southern
District of New York of the results of our internal investigation into our stock option grant
practices and will continue to cooperate with these governmental entities and their investigations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We initiated an internal investigation of our stock option grant practices in response to the
pending informal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a subpoena from a
grand jury in the Southern District of New York. The investigation reviewed our historical stock
option grant practices during the period from 1994 through 2005, including all 73 stock option
grants made by us during this period, and the related disclosure in our Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended March&nbsp;31, 2006, filed May&nbsp;15, 2006 (the &#147;May&nbsp;2006 Form&nbsp;10-Q&#148;).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The investigation was overseen by a special committee of the Board of Directors which consisted of
all the independent members of the Board. The special committee retained Bracewell &#038; Giuliani LLP
as independent counsel to conduct the internal investigation. In November&nbsp;2006 the results of the
investigation were reported to the special committee, at which time the committee submitted
recommendations for action to the Board. These recommendations have been implemented by the Board
substantially as submitted by the special committee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the course of the investigation, more than 2&nbsp;million pages of electronic and hardcopy
documents and emails were reviewed. In addition, approximately 40 interviews of current and former
officers, directors, employees and other individuals were conducted. The independent directors, in
their role as special committee members and as independent directors prior to formation of the
committee, met extensively since the SEC investigation commenced to consider the matters related to
the stock option grant practices. The investigation was necessarily limited in that the
investigation team did not have access to certain witnesses with relevant information (including
former Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey A. Rich) and due to the lack of metadata for certain
electronic documentation prior to 2000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following background pertaining to our historical stock option grant practices was confirmed
through the investigation. Option grants were typically initiated by our senior management or
Darwin Deason, Chairman of the Board (and chairman of the compensation committee from 1994 through
August&nbsp;2003), on a prospective basis at times when they believed it was appropriate to consider
option grants and the price of our common stock was relatively low based on an analysis of, among
other things, price-earnings multiples. With respect to each grant of options to senior
executives, the Chairman gave a broad authorization to the CEO which included approval of option
recipients and the number of stock options to be awarded to each recipient. In the case of
non-senior management grants, the Chairman gave his general authorization for the awarding of
options and the CEO would subsequently obtain his approval of option recipients and the number of
stock options to be awarded. With respect to both senior executive and non-senior management
grants, after the Chairman&#146;s broad authorization, Jeffrey A. Rich, Mark A. King and/or Warren D.
Edwards then selected the date to be recorded as the grant date as they, assisted by employees who
reported to them, prepared the paperwork that documented the grant recommendations to be considered
by the applicable compensation committee. Thus, between 1994 and 2005, grant dates and related
exercise prices were generally selected by Mr.&nbsp;Rich, Mr.&nbsp;King, and/or Mr.&nbsp;Edwards. Mr.&nbsp;Rich served
as CFO during the period prior to 1994 and until May&nbsp;1995, President and Chief Operating Officer
from May&nbsp;1995 until February&nbsp;1999, President and Chief Executive Officer from February&nbsp;1999 until
August&nbsp;2002, and Chief Executive Officer from August&nbsp;2002 until his resignation September&nbsp;29, 2005.
Mr.&nbsp;King served as CFO from May&nbsp;1995 through March&nbsp;2001, COO from March&nbsp;2001 through August&nbsp;2002,
President and COO from August&nbsp;2002 through September&nbsp;2005, and President and CEO from September
2005 through November&nbsp;26, 2006. Mr.&nbsp;Edwards served as CFO from March&nbsp;2001 through November&nbsp;26,
2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As described in our May&nbsp;2006 Form 10-Q, our regular and special compensation committees used
unanimous written consents signed by all members of the committee ratifying their prior verbal
approvals of option grants to senior executives or options granted in connection with significant
acquisitions. In connection with option grants to senior executives, the historical practice was
for the Chairman, on or about the day he gave senior management his broad authorization to proceed
with preparing paperwork for option grants, to call each of the compensation committee members to
discuss and obtain approval for the grants. In cases where grants were awarded to senior
executives and in large blocks to non-senior management the Chairman and members of the
compensation committee discussed grants to senior executives specifically and, on certain
occasions, acknowledged generally that a block of grants would be awarded to non-senior management
as well. For grants to non-senior management which were not combined with senior executive grants,
the Chairman and the committee members generally did not discuss the grants at the time the
Chairman gave his broad authorization to senior management to proceed with preparing paperwork for
option grants, but unanimous written consents were subsequently signed by the committee members in
order to document the effective date of the grants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The investigation concluded that in a significant number of cases Mr.&nbsp;Rich, Mr.&nbsp;King and/or Mr.
Edwards used hindsight to select favorable grant dates during the limited time periods after Mr.
Deason had given the officers his authorization to proceed to prepare the paperwork for the option
grants and before formal grant documentation was submitted to the applicable compensation
committee. No evidence was found to suggest that grant dates which preceded Mr.&nbsp;Deason&#146;s broad
authorization were ever selected. In a number of instances, our stock price was trending downward
at the time Mr.&nbsp;Deason&#146;s authorization was given, but started to rise as the grant recommendation
memoranda were being finalized. The investigation found that in those instances Mr.&nbsp;Rich, Mr.&nbsp;King
and/or Mr.&nbsp;Edwards often looked back in time and selected as the &#147;grant date&#148; a date on which the
price was at a low, notwithstanding that the date had already passed and the stock price on the
date of the actual selection was higher. Recommendation memoranda attendant to these grants were
intentionally misdated at the direction of Mr.&nbsp;Rich, Mr.&nbsp;King and/or Mr.&nbsp;Edwards to make it appear
as if the memoranda had been created at or about the time of the chosen

grant date, when in fact, they had been created afterwards. As a result, stock options were
awarded at prices that were at, or near, the quarterly low and we effectively granted &#147;in the
money&#148; options without recording the appropriate compensation expense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The evidence gathered in the investigation disclosed that aside from Mr.&nbsp;Rich, Mr.&nbsp;King and Mr.
Edwards, one other of our current management employees, who is not an executive officer or
director, was aware of the intentional misdating of documents. Based on the evidence reviewed, no
other current executives, directors or management employees were aware of either the improper use
of hindsight in selecting grant dates or the intentional misdating of documents. It was also
determined that these improper practices were generally followed with respect to option grants made
to both senior executives and other employees. No evidence was found to suggest that the practices
were selectively employed to favor executive officers over other employees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, with respect to our May&nbsp;2006 Form 10-Q, the investigation concluded that Note 3 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements which stated, in part, that we did &#147;not believe that any director
or officer of the Company has engaged in the intentional backdating of stock option grants in order
to achieve a more advantageous exercise price,&#148; was inaccurate because, at the time the May&nbsp;2006
Form 10-Q was filed, Mr.&nbsp;King and Mr.&nbsp;Edwards either knew or should have known that we awarded
options through a process in which favorable grant dates were selected with the benefit of
hindsight in order to achieve a more advantageous exercise price and that the term &#147;backdating&#148; was
readily applicable to our option grant process. Neither Mr.&nbsp;King nor Mr.&nbsp;Edwards told our
directors, outside counsel or independent accountants that our stock options were often granted by
looking back and taking advantage of past low prices. Instead, both Mr.&nbsp;King and Mr.&nbsp;Edwards
attributed the disparity between recorded grant dates and the creation dates of the paperwork
attendant to the stock option grants to other factors that did not involve the use of hindsight.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The investigation concluded that the conduct of Mr.&nbsp;King and Mr.&nbsp;Edwards with regard to the
misdating of recommendation memoranda as well as their conduct with regard to the May&nbsp;2006 Form
10-Q violated our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. As a result the special committee
recommended that Mr.&nbsp;King and Mr.&nbsp;Edwards should resign. Effective November&nbsp;26, 2006 each of Mr.
King and Mr.&nbsp;Edwards resigned from all executive management positions with us. Please see Note 23
for a discussion of the terms of their separation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to the resignations of Mr.&nbsp;King and Mr.&nbsp;Edwards and the approval of the terms of their
separation, the Board of Directors announced the following actions and decisions, which have been

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We concluded that there were accounting errors with respect to a number of stock option grants. In
general, these stock options were originally granted with an exercise price equal to the NYSE or
NASDAQ closing market price for our common stock on the date set forth on unanimous written
consents signed by one or more members of the appropriate Compensation Committees. We originally
used the stated date of these consents as the &#147;measurement date&#148; for the purpose of accounting for
them under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;), and as a result recorded no
compensation expense in connection with the grants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We concluded that a number of unanimous written consents were not fully executed or effective on
the date set forth on the consents and that using the date stated thereon as the measurement date
was incorrect. We determined a revised measurement date for each stock option grant based on the
information now available to us. The revised measurement date reflects the date for which there is
objective evidence that the required granting actions necessary to approve the grants, in
accordance with our corporate governance procedures, were completed. The accounting guidelines we
used in determining the correct accounting measurement date for our option grants require clear
evidence of final corporate granting action approving the option grants. Therefore, while the
internal investigation did not conclude that option grant dates with respect to certain grants had
been selected with hindsight, we nevertheless concluded in many cases that the accounting
measurement dates for these grants should be adjusted because the final corporate granting action
occurred after the original grant date reflected in our unanimous written consents. In cases where
the closing market price on the revised measurement date exceeded the NYSE or NASDAQ closing market
price on the original measurement date, we have recognized compensation expense equal to this
excess over the vesting term of each option, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148; (&#147;APB 25&#148;), for periods ending on or before June
30, 2005. Additionally, beginning July&nbsp;1, 2005, we recognized compensation expense in accordance
with SFAS 123(R) based on the fair value of stock options granted, using the revised measurement
dates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Subsequent to the delivery of the results of the investigation, we, with the approval of our Audit
Committee, determined that the cumulative non-cash stock-based compensation expense adjustment and
related income tax effects was material. Our decision to restate our financial statements was based
on the facts obtained by management and the special committee. We determined that the cumulative,
pre-tax, non-cash stock-based compensation expense resulting from revised measurement dates was
approximately $51.2&nbsp;million during the period from our initial public offering in 1994 through June
30, 2006. The corrections relate to options covering approximately 19.4&nbsp;million shares. Previously
reported total revenues were not impacted by our restatement. The impact of the restatement on
each year of our previously issued financial statements is more fully disclosed in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Related income tax effects included deferred income tax benefits on the compensation expense, and
additional income tax liabilities and estimated penalties and interest related to the application
of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and related Treasury Regulations (&#147;Section&nbsp;162(m)&#148;) to
stock-based executive compensation previously deducted, that was no longer deductible as a result
of revised measurement dates of certain stock option grants. We also included in our restatements
additional income tax liabilities and estimated penalties and interest, with adjustments to
additional paid-in capital and income tax expense, related to certain cash and stock-based
executive compensation deductions previously taken under Section&nbsp;162(m), which we believed may be
non-deductible as a result of information that has been obtained by us in connection with our
internal investigation, due to factors unrelated to revised measurement dates. Through June&nbsp;30,
2007, we recorded approximately $33.4&nbsp;million of additional income taxes, estimated penalties and
interest related to disallowed Section 162(m) executive compensation deductions resulting from
revised measurement dates. At this time, we cannot predict when these Section 162(m) issues will be
resolved; however, during fiscal year 2007, we paid approximately $35&nbsp;million of estimated income
taxes, penalties and interest
related to Section 162(m) issues in order to reduce future interest
that would accrue on the amounts of estimated taxes, penalties and interest. This payment is
reflected in cash flows from operating activities at June&nbsp;30, 2007. During fiscal year 2007, we
reversed approximately $6&nbsp;million of accrued income taxes, penalties and interest associated with

executive officers, other executive officers and former executive officers were amended in order to
re-price all or a portion of the respective option grant to the correct accounting measurement date
to avoid adverse tax consequences to individual option holders under Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal
Revenue Code. We will pay cash payments in the aggregate amount of $2.4&nbsp;million in accordance with
the terms of the amendment, which will be paid in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 from cash
flows from operating activities. Of the $2.4&nbsp;million cash payment, approximately $0.5&nbsp;million was
expensed in fiscal year 2007, and the balance was charged to Additional Paid-in Capital.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;18, 2007, we initiated a tender offer to amend certain options (the &#147;Eligible
Options&#148;) to purchase an aggregate of 1,703,650 shares (as amended) of our Class&nbsp;A common stock in
order to re-price all or a portion of the respective option grant to the correct accounting
measurement date to avoid adverse tax consequences to individual option holders under Section&nbsp;409A
of the Internal Revenue Code. The Eligible Options included options that (i)&nbsp;were granted under
our 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended; (ii)&nbsp;had exercise prices per share that were less, or
may have been less, than the fair market value per share of ACS on the revised measurement dates
for such options, as determined by us for accounting and tax purposes; (iii)&nbsp;were unexercised and
unvested, either in whole or in part, as of January&nbsp;1, 2005; (iv)&nbsp;were outstanding as of the
expiration time of this tender offer; and (v)&nbsp;were held by individuals who (x)&nbsp;were employed by the
Company through the expiration time of this tender offer (other than any executive officer or
director) and (y)&nbsp;are subject to income taxation in the United States. Eligible participants could
elect to (i)&nbsp;amend Eligible Options to increase the exercise price per share to the fair market
value of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock on the respective option&#146;s measurement date and (ii)
receive a cash payment equal to the difference between the new exercise price per share of each
amended option and the original exercise price per share of such amended option, multiplied by the
number of unexercised shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock subject to such amended option.
This payment will be made on or before the eligible option holder&#146;s first regular payroll date in
January&nbsp;2008. Please see Note 29 for a discussion of the results of the tender offer, as well as

2007, plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Consolidated Complaint, adding causes of action related to
the announced buy-out transaction as well. On May&nbsp;1, 2007, ACS and the individual defendants filed
a Special Exceptions Motion, on the grounds that plaintiffs&#146; buy-out claims were not yet ripe for
adjudication, i.e., no claim related to the Proposal can properly be the subject of litigation,
because the Proposal has not been accepted or recommended by either the Company or by the Special
Committee formed to evaluate the Proposal and strategic alternatives to the Proposal, and that
plaintiffs cannot bring both direct and derivative claims in a single lawsuit. The Third Amended
Petition also alleges claims of breach of fiduciary duty premised upon an allegation that our
assets and information were misappropriated by Mr.&nbsp;Deason and Cerberus in order to facilitate their
preparation of the Proposal, and that the Proposal represents an attempt to extinguish the
derivative claims related to stock option practices by eliminating the standing of the plaintiff
stockholders to pursue those claims. The Third Amended Petition also suggests that the
consideration offered to stockholders in the Proposal is inadequate and seeks to enjoin
consummation of the Proposal. The court has not yet scheduled a hearing date on our Special
Exceptions Motion, which seeks to dismiss the buy-out claims.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Also, on March&nbsp;29, 2007, the two stand-alone buy-out cases pending in the TX State District Court

buy-out transaction as well, and adding as defendants, Clifford Kendall, David Black, Henry
Hortenstine, Peter A. Bracken, William Deckelman, Jr., PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP, and Cerberus
Capital Management LP. Like the Third Amended Petition in the Texas State Court Derivative Action,
the Second Amended Complaint in the Texas Federal Court Derivative Action challenged both the
process through which the Proposal was generated, and the substance of the Proposal. On June&nbsp;4,
2007, ACS and the individual defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint, on
the grounds that the buy-out claims were not yet ripe for adjudication, i.e., no claim related to
the Proposal can properly be the subject of litigation, because the Proposal has not been accepted
or recommended by either the Company or by the Special Committee formed to evaluate the Proposal
and strategic alternatives to the Proposal. On August&nbsp;1, 2007, the federal judge dismissed the
buy-out related causes of action. The federal judge also dismissed the SEC Rule&nbsp;10(b)5 cause of
action against defendant William Deckelman, Jr., based on plaintiff&#146;s failure to state a claim
against Mr.&nbsp;Deckelman. Defendant David Black was also dismissed from this case by the plaintiffs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Proposal has not been recommended or accepted by ACS, or by the Special Committee formed to

services. We acquired this subsidiary and contract from Lockheed Martin Corporation in August
2001, when we acquired Lockheed Martin IMS Corporation. The contract currently is on a
month-to-month term with revenues of approximately $2.3&nbsp;million, $2.3&nbsp;million and $2&nbsp;million (U.S.
dollars) in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A renewal contract had been awarded
to our subsidiary in 2004 on a sole source basis, but this renewal award was rescinded by the City
of Edmonton and a subsequent request for proposals for an expanded photo enforcement contract was
issued in September&nbsp;2004. Prior to announcement of any award, however, the City of Edmonton
suspended this procurement process, pending the completion of the investigation by the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, which led to the February&nbsp;15, 2006 summons. We conducted an internal
investigation of this matter, and based on our findings from our internal investigation, we believe
that our subsidiary has sustainable defenses to the charge. We notified the U.S. Department of
Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission upon our receipt of the summons and
continue to periodically report the status of this matter to them.

June&nbsp;8, 2007, the Alberta government withdrew the original charges against the two police officers,
and informed the court it would proceed against them on the lesser charge of &#147;breach of public
trust and fraud on the government.&#148; On June&nbsp;27, 2007, the Alberta government also withdrew the
original charge against our subsidiary, and informed the court that it would proceed against our
subsidiary on the lesser charge of &#147;aiding and abetting a breach of public trust and fraud on the
government.&#148; On August&nbsp;8, 2007, the Alberta government dismissed all charges against one of the
police officers. A preliminary hearing on this matter has been scheduled for September&nbsp;10, 2007.

possible at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">One of our subsidiaries, ACS Defense, LLC, and several other government contractors received a
grand jury document subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in
October&nbsp;2002. The subpoena was issued in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;). The inquiry concerns certain IDIQ
(Indefinite Delivery &#150; Indefinite Quantity) procurements and their related task orders, which
occurred in the late 1990s at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts. In February&nbsp;2004, we sold
the contracts associated with the Hanscom Air Force Base relationship to ManTech International
Corporation (&#147;ManTech&#148;); however, we have agreed to indemnify ManTech with respect to this DOJ
investigation. The DOJ is continuing its investigation, but we have no information as to when the
DOJ will conclude this process. We have cooperated with the DOJ in producing documents in response
to the subpoena, and our internal investigation and review of this matter through outside legal
counsel will continue through the conclusion of the DOJ investigatory process. We are unable to

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Another of our subsidiaries, ACS State &#038; Local Solutions, Inc. (&#147;ACS SLS&#148;), and a teaming partner
of this subsidiary, Tier Technologies, Inc. (&#147;Tier&#148;), received a grand jury document subpoena
issued by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in May&nbsp;2003. The subpoena
was issued in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. We
believe that the inquiry concerns the teaming arrangements between ACS SLS and Tier on child
support payment processing contracts awarded to ACS SLS, and Tier as a subcontractor to ACS SLS, in
New York, Illinois and Ohio but may also extend to the conduct of ACS SLS and Tier with respect to
the bidding process for child support contracts in certain other states. Effective June&nbsp;30, 2004,
Tier was no longer a subcontractor to us in Ohio. Our revenue from the contracts for which Tier
was a subcontractor was approximately $45.2&nbsp;million, $45.6&nbsp;million and $43.5&nbsp;million for fiscal
years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing approximately 0.8%, 0.9% and 1% of our
revenues for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our teaming arrangement with Tier also
contemplated the California child support payment processing request for proposals, which was
issued in late 2003; however, we did not enter into a teaming agreement with Tier for the
California request for proposals. Based on Tier&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, we understand that on November&nbsp;20, 2003, the DOJ granted conditional amnesty to Tier in
connection with this inquiry pursuant to the DOJ&#146;s Corporate Leniency Policy. The policy provides
that the DOJ will not bring any criminal charges against Tier as long as it continues to fully
cooperate in the inquiry (and makes restitution payments if it is determined that parties were
injured as a result of impermissible anticompetitive conduct). In May&nbsp;2006, we were advised that
one of our current employees, (who has not been active in our government business segment since
June&nbsp;2005), and one former employee of ACS SLS, both of whom held senior management positions in
the subsidiary during the period in question, received target letters from the DOJ related to this
inquiry. The DOJ is continuing its investigation, but we have no information as to when the DOJ
will conclude this process. We have cooperated with the DOJ in producing documents in response to
the subpoena, and our internal investigation and review of this matter through outside legal
counsel will continue through the conclusion of the DOJ investigatory process.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;30, 2004, the Florida Agency for Workforce Innovation&#146;s (&#147;AWI&#148;) Office of Inspector
General (&#147;OIG&#148;) issued a report that reviewed 13 Florida workforce regions, including Dade and
Monroe counties, and noted concerns related to the accuracy of customer case records maintained by
our local staff. Our total revenue generated from the Florida workforce services amounts to
approximately 0.4% and 0.9% of our revenues for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. We had
no revenue related to this contract in fiscal year 2007. In March&nbsp;2004, we filed our response to
the OIG report. The principal workforce policy organization for the State of Florida, which
oversees and monitors the administration of the State&#146;s workforce policy and the programs carried
out by AWI and the regional workforce boards, is Workforce Florida, Inc. (&#147;WFI&#148;). On May&nbsp;20, 2004,
the Board of Directors of WFI held a public meeting at which the Board announced that WFI did not
see a systemic problem with our performance of these workforce services and that it considered the
issue closed. There were also certain contract billing issues that arose during the course of our
performance of our workforce contract in Dade County, Florida, which ended in June&nbsp;2003. However,
during the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, we settled all financial issues with Dade County with
respect to our workforce contract with that county and the settlement is fully reflected in our
results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. We were also advised in February
2004 that the SEC had initiated an informal investigation into the matters covered by the OIG&#146;s
report, although we have not received any request for information or documents since the middle of
calendar year 2004. On March&nbsp;22, 2004, ACS SLS received a grand jury document subpoena issued by
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The subpoena was issued in
connection with an inquiry being conducted by the DOJ and the Inspector General&#146;s Office of the
U.S. Department of Labor (&#147;DOL&#148;) into the subsidiary&#146;s workforce contracts in Dade and Monroe
counties in Florida, which also expired in June&nbsp;2003, and which were included in the OIG&#146;s report.
On August&nbsp;11, 2005, the South Florida Workforce Board notified us that all deficiencies in our Dade
County workforce contract have been appropriately addressed and all findings are considered
resolved. On August&nbsp;25, 2004, ACS SLS received a grand jury document subpoena issued by the U.S.
District Court for the Middle District of Florida in connection with an inquiry being conducted by
the DOJ and the Inspector General&#146;s Office of the DOL. The subpoena related to a workforce
contract in Pinellas County, Florida, for the period from January&nbsp;1999 to the contract&#146;s expiration
in March&nbsp;2001, which was prior to our acquisition of this business from Lockheed Martin Corporation
in August&nbsp;2001. Further, we settled a civil lawsuit with Pinellas County in December&nbsp;2003, with
respect to claims related to the services rendered to Pinellas County by Lockheed Martin
Corporation prior to our acquisition of ACS SLS (those claims having been transferred with ACS SLS
as part of the acquisition), and the settlement resulted in Pinellas County paying ACS SLS an
additional $600,000. We are continuing to cooperate with the DOJ and DOL in connection with their
investigations. At this stage of these investigations, we are unable to express an opinion as to
their likely outcome. It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or
range of loss, if any. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we completed the divestiture
of substantially all of our welfare-to-workforce business (please see Note 6 for further
information). However, we retained the liabilities for this business which arose from activities
prior to the date of closing, including the contingent liabilities discussed above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;3, 2003, a Complaint was filed under seal in the United States District Court, Middle
District of Florida, Tampa Division, by a former Pinellas County, Florida Assistant County
Administrator under the &#147;Qui Tam&#148; provisions of the False Claims Act. On October&nbsp;23, 2006, the
United States filed a notice with the court that it would not intervene in the Complaint. The
court then entered an order to unseal the Complaint and, we were subsequently served with the
Complaint. The allegations in this Complaint arise from the workforce contract in Pinellas County,
Florida, that is the subject of the grand jury document subpoena issued by the U.S. District Court
for the Middle District of Florida in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the DOJ and the
Inspector General&#146;s Office of the DOL (as discussed above). We intend to vigorously defend this
case. However, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range

contractual obligations with our clients. Approximately $22.3&nbsp;million of letters of credit and
$1.8&nbsp;million of surety bonds secure our casualty insurance and vendor programs and other corporate
obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of
default in our performance of our obligations under each contract; the probability of which we
believe is remote. We believe that we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity
from our cash flow and our Credit Facility to respond to future requests for proposals.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are obligated to make certain contingent payments to former shareholders of acquired entities
upon satisfaction of certain contractual criteria in conjunction with certain acquisitions. During
fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we made contingent consideration payments of $25.4&nbsp;million, $9.8
million and $17&nbsp;million, respectively, related to acquisitions completed in prior years. As of
June&nbsp;30, 2007, the maximum aggregate amount of the outstanding contingent obligations to former
shareholders of acquired entities is approximately $90.6&nbsp;million of which $21&nbsp;million has been
earned as of June&nbsp;30, 2007. The $21&nbsp;million was accrued as of June&nbsp;30, 2007 and is expected to be

student loan servicing in the Federal Family Education Loan program (&#147;FFEL&#148;) on behalf of various
financial institutions. We service these loans for investors under outsourcing arrangements and do
not acquire any servicing rights that are transferable by us to a third party. At June&nbsp;30, 2007,
we serviced a FFEL portfolio of approximately 2.2&nbsp;million loans with an outstanding principal
balance of approximately $32.5&nbsp;billion. Some servicing agreements contain provisions that, under
certain circumstances, require us to purchase the loans from the investor if the loan guaranty has
been permanently terminated as a result of a loan default caused by our servicing error. If
defaults caused by us are cured during an initial period, any obligation we may have to purchase
these loans expires. Loans that we purchase may be subsequently cured, the guaranty reinstated and
then we repackage the loans for sale to third parties. We evaluate our exposure under our purchase
obligations on defaulted loans and establish a reserve for potential losses, or default liability
reserve, through a charge to the provision for loss on defaulted loans purchased. The reserve is
evaluated periodically and adjusted based upon management&#146;s analysis of the historical performance
of the defaulted loans. As of June&nbsp;30, 2007, other accrued liabilities include reserves which we

administrative and legal relief to set aside the contract award. However, we continued our
performance of the contract at the request of DHHS. On June&nbsp;12, 2006, we reported that contract

The parties entered into a series of standstill agreements in order to permit discussion of their
respective issues regarding the contract and whether the contract would be continued or terminated.
On July&nbsp;14, 2006, the DHHS sent us a letter notifying us of the termination of the contract. We
filed in the General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, in Wake County, North Carolina, a
complaint and motion to preserve records related to the contract. Subsequent to the filing of the
complaint, North Carolina produced records and represented to the Court that all records had been
produced, after which the complaint was dismissed. In a letter dated August&nbsp;1, 2006, DHHS notified
us of its position that the value of reductions in compensation assessable against the compensation
otherwise due to us under the contract is approximately $33&nbsp;million. On August&nbsp;14, 2006, we
provided a detailed response to that August&nbsp;1, 2006 letter contending that there should be no
reductions in compensation owed to us. Also, on August&nbsp;14, 2006 and in accordance with the
contract, we submitted our Termination Claim to DHHS seeking additional compensation of
approximately $27.1&nbsp;million. On January&nbsp;22, 2007, we filed a complaint in the General Court of
Justice, Superior Court Division, in Wake County, North Carolina against DHHS and the Secretary of
DHHS seeking to recover damages in excess of $40&nbsp;million that we have suffered as the result of
actions of DHHS and its Secretary. Our claim was based on breach of contract; breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing; breach of warranty; and misappropriation of our trade
secrets. In the complaint we also requested the court to grant a declaratory judgment that we were
not in default under the contract; and a permanent injunction against the State from using our
proprietary materials and disclosing our proprietary material to third parties. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2006, we recorded a charge of approximately $4.0&nbsp;million, of which $3.9
million was charged to revenue, related to our assessment of realization of amounts previously
recognized for the North Carolina MMIS contract.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;22, 2007, we settled all issues with DHHS. Pursuant to the settlement, DHHS rescinded its
June&nbsp;6, 2006 notice of intent to terminate the NCMMIS contract and its July&nbsp;14, 2006 notice of
termination and the parties agreed to a mutual termination of the contract. We agreed, as part of
the settlement, to license to DHHS certain work product we produced in connection with the NCMMIS
contract and DHHS has agreed to pay us the aggregate amount of $10.5&nbsp;million in four installments
beginning on or before March&nbsp;31, 2007 and ending on or before June&nbsp;30, 2008. We recognized $3.4
million in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 related to this settlement. In
addition, we have entered into several new contracts, with terms of two years, to provide new
services to DHHS and will be compensated based on achieving certain levels of cost savings.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have provided loan servicing for the Department of Education&#146;s (the &#147;Department&#148;) Direct
Student Loan program for over ten years. In 2003, the Department conducted a competitive
procurement for its &#147;Common Services for Borrowers&#148; initiative (&#147;CSB&#148;). CSB was a modernization
initiative which integrated a number of student loan processing services for the Department,
allowing the Department to increase loan servicing quality while saving overall program costs. In
November&nbsp;2003, the Department awarded us the CSB contract. Under this contract we provide
comprehensive loan servicing, consolidation loan processing, debt collection services on delinquent
accounts, IT infrastructure operations and support, maintenance and development of information
systems, and portfolio management services for the Department of Education&#146;s Direct Student Loan
program. The CSB contract has a 5-year base term which began in January&nbsp;2004 and provides the
Department of Education five one-year options to extend after the base term. Annual revenues from this contract represent approximately 4% of our fiscal year 2007 revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2007, we and the Department agreed to cease development of certain software contemplated
under the CSB contract. At that time, we had implemented approximately $39&nbsp;million of internally
developed software into the current production system. As a result of the decision to cease
development, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $76.4&nbsp;million (approximately
$48.3&nbsp;million, net of income tax) related to in-process capitalized development costs.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;26, 2006, Mark A. King resigned as our President, Chief Executive Officer and as a
director. In connection therewith, on November&nbsp;26, 2006 we and Mr.&nbsp;King entered into a separation
agreement (the &#147;King Agreement&#148;). The King Agreement provided, among other things, that Mr.&nbsp;King
remain with us as an employee providing transitional services until June&nbsp;30, 2007. In addition,
under the terms of the King Agreement, all unvested stock options held by Mr.&nbsp;King have been
terminated as of November&nbsp;26, 2006, excluding options that would have otherwise vested prior to
August&nbsp;31, 2007 which will be permitted to vest on their regularly scheduled vesting dates provided
that Mr.&nbsp;King does not materially breach certain specified provisions of the King Agreement. In
accordance with the King Agreement, the exercise price of Mr.&nbsp;King&#146;s vested stock options were
increased to an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock on the correct accounting
measurement date as determined in conjunction with the audit of our financial statements for the
fiscal year ending June&nbsp;30, 2006 and the exercise price of certain vested options were further
increased by the amount by which the aggregate exercise price of stock options previously exercised
by Mr.&nbsp;King would have been increased had the stock options not been previously exercised. Mr.
King&#146;s vested options, if unexercised, will expire no later than June&nbsp;30, 2008. The King Agreement
also subjects Mr.&nbsp;King to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants until December&nbsp;31, 2009.
In addition, the King Agreement provides that Mr.&nbsp;King&#146;s severance agreement with us is terminated,
Mr.&nbsp;King&#146;s salary was reduced during the transition period and Mr.&nbsp;King was not eligible to
participate in our bonus plans, and Mr.&nbsp;King will be eligible to receive certain of our provided
health benefits through December&nbsp;31, 2009, the estimated cost of which is not material.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On September&nbsp;29, 2005, Jeffrey A. Rich submitted his resignation as a director and Chief Executive
Officer. On September&nbsp;30, 2005 we entered into an Agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Rich, which, among other
things, provided the following: (i)&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Rich remained on our payroll and was paid his then current
base salary (of $820 thousand annually) through June&nbsp;30, 2006; (ii)&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Rich was not eligible to
participate in our performance-based incentive compensation program in fiscal year 2006; (iii)&nbsp;we
purchased from Mr.&nbsp;Rich all options previously granted to Mr.&nbsp;Rich that were vested as of the date
of the Agreement in exchange for an aggregate cash payment, less applicable income and payroll
taxes, equal to the amount determined by subtracting the exercise price of each such vested option
from $54.08 per share and all such vested options were terminated and cancelled; (iv)&nbsp;all options
previously granted to Mr.&nbsp;Rich that were unvested as of the date of the Agreement were terminated
(such options had an in-the-money value of approximately $4.6&nbsp;million based on the closing price of
our stock on the New York Stock Exchange on September&nbsp;29, 2005); (v)&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Rich received a lump sum
cash payment of $4.1&nbsp;million; (vi)&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Rich continued to receive executive benefits for health,
dental and vision through September&nbsp;30, 2007; (vii)&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Rich also received limited administrative
assistance through September&nbsp;30, 2006; and (viii)&nbsp;in the event Mr.&nbsp;Rich established an M&#038;A advisory
firm by January&nbsp;1, 2007, we agreed to retain such firm for a two year period from its formation for
$250 thousand per year plus a negotiated success fee for completed transactions. The Agreement
also contains certain standard restrictions, including restrictions on soliciting our employees for
a period of three years and soliciting our customers or competing with us for a period of two
years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we accrued $5.4&nbsp;million ($3.4&nbsp;million, net of income
taxes) of compensation expense (recorded in wages and benefits in our Consolidated Statements of
Income) related to the Agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Rich. In addition, the purchase of Mr.&nbsp;Rich&#146;s
unexercised vested stock options for approximately $18.4&nbsp;million ($11.7&nbsp;million, net of income
taxes) was recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. We made payments of
approximately $23.6&nbsp;million related to this Agreement in fiscal year 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the departure of Mr.&nbsp;Rich, we entered into an agreement with Rich Capital LLC,
an M&#038;A advisory firm owned by Mr.&nbsp;Rich. The agreement is for two years, during which time we will
pay a total of $0.5&nbsp;million for M&#038;A advisory services, payable in equal quarterly installments. We
paid $63 thousand to his M&#038;A advisory firm related to this agreement through June&nbsp;30, 2006.
However, we have currently suspended payment under this agreement pending a determination whether
Rich Capital LLC is capable of performing its obligations under the contract in view of the
internal investigation&#146;s conclusions regarding stock options awarded to Mr.&nbsp;Rich. No payments were
made related to this agreement in fiscal year 2007.

Cerberus to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to 2002 we had guaranteed $11.5&nbsp;million of certain loan obligations owed to Citicorp USA,
Inc. by DDH Aviation, Inc., a corporate airplane brokerage company organized in 1997 (as may have
been reorganized subsequent to July&nbsp;2002, herein referred to as &#147;DDH&#148;). Our Chairman owned a
majority interest in DDH. In consideration for that guaranty, we had access to corporate aircraft
at favorable rates. In July&nbsp;2002, our Chairman assumed in full our guaranty obligations to
Citicorp and Citicorp released in full our guaranty obligations. As partial consideration for the
release of our corporate guaranty, we agreed to provide certain administrative services to DDH at
no charge until such time as DDH meets certain specified financial criteria. In the first quarter
of fiscal year 2003, we purchased $1&nbsp;million in prepaid charter flights at favorable rates from
DDH. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we were notified by DDH of their intent to wind
down operations; therefore, we recorded a charge of $0.6&nbsp;million related to the unused prepaid
charter flights. We made no payments to DDH during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005. Previously,
we reported that we anticipated that the administrative services we are providing to DDH would
cease prior to June&nbsp;30, 2007 as a result of the wind down of the DDH operations. Because of

$9.0&nbsp;million, respectively, of office products and printing services from Prestige Business
Solutions, Inc., a supplier owned by the daughter-in-law of our Chairman, Darwin Deason. These

environments of each segment, caused by different types of clients, differing economic
characteristics, and the nature of regulatory environments. In the Commercial segment, we provide
business process outsourcing, information technology services, systems integration services and
consulting services to clients including healthcare providers and payors, pharmaceutical and other
manufacturers, retailers, wholesale distributors, utilities, entertainment companies, higher
education institutions, financial institutions, insurance and transportation companies. In the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>28. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;30, 2007, we adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;158 &#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans &#150; An Amendment of FASB Statements No.&nbsp;87, 88, 106, and 132R&#148; (&#147;SFAS
158&#148;). This Statement requires recognition of the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the
statement of financial position as an asset or liability if the plan is overfunded or underfunded,
respectively. Changes in the funded status of a plan are required to be recognized in the year in
which the changes occur, and reported in comprehensive income as a separate component of
stockholders&#146; equity. Further, certain gains and losses that were not previously recognized in the
financial statements are required to be reported in comprehensive income, and certain disclosure
requirements were changed. SFAS 158 also requires the measurement date of the plan&#146;s funded status
to be the same as the company&#146;s fiscal year end. There was no change to our June&nbsp;30 measurement
date as a result of the adoption of SFAS 158. Adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in an increase to
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of approximately $2.4&nbsp;million, net of $1.0
million deferred income tax.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;157 &#147;Fair Value Measurements&#148; (&#147;SFAS 157&#148;). SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement clarifies that the exchange
price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or
transfer a liability at the measurement date. The statement emphasizes that fair value is a
market-based measurement and not an entity-specific measurement. It also establishes a fair value
hierarchy used in fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures of assets and
liabilities measured at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. The adoption of this standard is not expected to
have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operation or liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the SEC released SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;108, &#147;Considering the Effects
of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements&#148;
(&#147;SAB 108&#148;), which addresses how uncorrected errors in previous years should be considered when
quantifying errors in current-year financial statements. SAB 108 requires registrants to consider
the effect of all carry over and reversing effects of prior-year misstatements when quantifying
errors in current-year financial statements. SAB 108 does not change the SEC staff&#146;s previous
guidance on evaluating the materiality of errors. It allows registrants to record the effects of
adopting SAB 108 guidance as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. This adjustment
must be reported in the annual financial statements of the first fiscal year ending after November
15, 2006. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition,
results of operation or liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In
July&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48 (&#147;FIN 48&#148;), &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes&#151;an interpretation of FASB Statement
No.&nbsp;109&#148;, which prescribes comprehensive guidelines
for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions
taken or expected to be taken on tax returns. FIN 48, effective for fiscal years beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2006, seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the
recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. The provisions of FIN 48 must
be adopted by the Company as of July&nbsp;1, 2007 and reported in the financial statements for the
period ended September&nbsp;30, 2007. Consequently, we are currently assessing the impact of FIN 48 and
have not yet determined the impact this interpretation will have on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities &#151; Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;115&#148;, (&#147;SFAS 159&#148;) which
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value at specified election dates. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS
159 provides entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by
measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge
accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity&#146;s fiscal year
beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous
fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first 120&nbsp;days of that fiscal year
and also elects to apply the provisions of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;157, &#147;Fair Value Measurements&#148;. We
have not yet determined the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 will have on our financial position or
results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Stock option repricing</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Note 21, on June&nbsp;18, 2007, we initiated a tender offer to amend certain options to
purchase an aggregate of 1,703,650 shares (as amended) of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. The tender
offer expired on July&nbsp;17, 2007. Pursuant to the offer, we accepted for amendment options to
purchase 1,696,650 shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, which represented 99.6% of the shares of our
Class&nbsp;A common stock subject to all Eligible Options. We will pay cash payments in the aggregate
amount of $4.0&nbsp;million in accordance with the terms of the tender offer, which will be paid in the
third quarter of fiscal year 2008 from cash flows from operating activities. Of the $4.0&nbsp;million
cash payment, we anticipate that approximately $1.3&nbsp;million will be expensed and the balance will
be charged to Additional Paid-in Capital in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2007, we notified former employees with vested, unexercised and outstanding options which
had exercise prices per share that were less, or may have been less, than the fair market value per
share of ACS on the revised measurement dates for such options, as determined by us for accounting
and tax purposes, that we will pay them the additional 20% income tax imposed by Section&nbsp;409A based
on the excess, if any, of the fair market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock (up to $62 per share)
on the date a triggering event occurs or condition exists that under Section&nbsp;409A results in the
excess being recognized and reported as income on the former employee&#146;s W-2 and the exercise price
of the affected option (reduced by any gain that had become subject to tax in a prior year because
of an earlier triggering event). We anticipate that these income tax reimbursements will be up to
approximately $1.9&nbsp;million based on the current fair market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock on
the exercise date and will be paid from cash flows from operating activities as the triggering
event occurs for each option holder, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. In the
first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we will accrue the estimated charge related to these income tax
reimbursements based on the current fair market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and adjust the
accrual each quarter until the options are exercised.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Potential sale of the Company</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;10, 2007, we announced the suspension of the Exclusivity Agreement between Darwin Deason and Cerberus expired
at 11:59&nbsp;p.m. on August&nbsp;9, 2007. The Exclusivity Agreement is now in effect and is scheduled to
expire on November&nbsp;14, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">However, in light of the current conditions of the credit markets, the Special Committee is in
discussions with Cerberus and Mr.&nbsp;Deason regarding an extension of the suspension of the
Exclusivity Agreement. In addition, the Special Committee is continuing to have discussions with
respect to strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance of any particular outcome.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Stock option grants</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the December&nbsp;9, 2006 Compensation Committee meeting, it was recognized that the grants made
to Mr.&nbsp;Blodgett and Mr.&nbsp;Rexford were for a number of shares that were less than the number of
shares that would have been normally granted to a new CEO and new CFO because of the limited
number of options remaining available under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan. The Compensation
Committee noted that it should consider a future grant to supplement the number of options made in
the earlier grant so that the aggregate number of shares granted to Mr.&nbsp;Blodgett and Mr.&nbsp;Rexford
would be equal to the number that would normally be granted to a &#147;new&#148; CEO and &#147;new&#148; CFO. To
accomplish this purpose, at a meeting on July&nbsp;2, 2007, the Committee approved option grants (the
&#147;Grants&#148;) to Lynn Blodgett to purchase 60,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock under
the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and to John Rexford to purchase 25,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, subject to the waiver of the Stock Option Grant Policy by
the Board of Directors, which occurred on July&nbsp;9, 2007 and on which date the Grants became
effective.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of June&nbsp;30, 2007. Based on such
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in July&nbsp;2006 we acquired
Primax Recoveries, Inc. (&#147;Primax&#148;). We have excluded the Primax business from the scope of our
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2007. The Primax
business&#146; total revenues and total assets represent 0.8% and 1%, respectively of the related
consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Also as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in October&nbsp;2006, we
completed the acquisition of Systech Integrators, Inc. (&#147;Systech&#148;). We have excluded the Systech
business from the scope of our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of
June&nbsp;30, 2007. The Systech business&#146; total revenues and total assets represent 0.8% and 1.3%,
respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
June&nbsp;30, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
June&nbsp;30, 2007 using the criteria set forth in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission <I>. </I>Based on this evaluation,
management has concluded that, as of June&nbsp;30, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting
was effective.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
June&nbsp;30, 2007, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public
