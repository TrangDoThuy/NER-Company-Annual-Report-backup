COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

         During the year ended December 31, 2001, Directors received $600 for
each Bank Board meeting that they attended as well as an annual fee of $8,000.
Members of the Executive Committee and the Board Loan Committee received an
annual fee of $7,000. Members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation
Committee received an annual fee of $5,000. Members of all other committees
received $600 for each committee meeting that they attended during the year.
Members of the Board who are employees of the Company or the Bank do not receive
these fees. Generally, the Company's Board of Directors meets immediately prior
to or after a Bank Board meeting. In such instances, Directors do not receive
additional fees for attendance at meetings of the Company's Board. Otherwise,
the Directors of the Company receive the same fees they receive for attendance
at a Bank Board meeting.

         Pursuant to the Company's Deferred Stock Compensation Plan,
non-employee Directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries may elect to
defer payment of compensation for service as a Director. Directors who elect to
defer compensation are awarded stock units ("Stock Units") in lieu of cash
compensation. For each dollar of cash compensation foregone, Directors receive a
fraction of a Stock Unit equal to one divided by $15.75, the fair market value
of the Common Stock calculated as of July 1, 2001. Each Stock Unit represents
one share of the Company's Common Stock. At the current time, no Directors
participate in the Plan.

         In June 2000, the Company adopted a Transition and Retirement Plan for
Directors, which provides for a payment to eligible Directors upon their
retirement from the Board. To be eligible for a payment under the Plan, a
Director must have attained the age of 55 and must have served on the Board of
the Company or the Bank for at least 10 years. Depending on the length of
service, the payment upon retirement would be an amount equal to one to three
times the Director's Board Compensation, defined in the Plan as an amount equal
to the sum of (i) the annual fee paid to Directors for service on the Board and
(ii) the aggregate annual fees payable for attendance at 12 monthly Board
meetings.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1934

         During 2001, the Company was subject to Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which requires the
Company's officers and Directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a
registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of
ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Officers, Directors and greater-than-10% shareholders are required by SEC
regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they
file.

         Based solely on its review of the copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 furnished
to the Company during and with respect to 2001, or written representations that
no Forms 5 were required, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) filing
requirements applicable to the Company's and the Bank's officers, Directors and
greater-than-10% beneficial owners were complied with during 2001.

    and the future performance of the Company's Common Stock. There can be no
    assurances that the rates of appreciation assumed in this table can be
    achieved or that the amounts shown will be received by the individuals.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

         The Compensation Committee of the Board is currently composed of three
Directors, Messrs. Atwood, Carver and Littlefield. The Compensation Committee
administers the Company's stock option plans. This Committee is charged with the
responsibility of reviewing and approving executive officers' compensation and
recommending all discretionary grants of stock options under the Company's stock
option plans. The following describes the compensation programs in effect during
fiscal 2001.

COMPENSATION POLICY

         The Company's compensation policies are designed to pay executives an
annual salary that is industry competitive and an annual bonus that is based
both on the performance of the Company (as compared to its annual business plan
as well as a selected peer group) and on individual goals established for each
of the executives for the fiscal year. The Company also has longer term
incentives based on stock options. All three components of compensation are
reviewed by the Committee to ensure salaries remain competitive, bonuses reward
performance and stock options provide continued incentives.

         Salaries for executive officers are based on the duties and
responsibilities of the position held by the executive compared with executive
officers of other companies in the industry. Salaries are reviewed and
established annually. Various industry salary surveys are reviewed in
establishing the new compensation. The Chief Executive Officer prepares a
performance review, including an assessment of prior-year performance, for each
executive officer, then communicates this information to the Compensation
Committee. Based on this information and its performance review of the Chief
Executive Officer, which is based on its assessment of the degree to which the
Chief Executive Officer accomplished pre-established strategic and financial
goals, the Compensation Committee makes recommendations to the Board of
Directors, which establishes annual executive salaries for the next year.

         Executive officers and key management employees of the Company and the
Bank participate in the Company's Management Incentive Compensation Program (the
"Bonus Plan"). Payments under the Bonus Plan are contingent on the Company
meeting its strategic and operational objectives for the fiscal year. Bonuses
may be awarded for the achievement of the Company's financial performance goals
and an individual participant's objectives. Bonus awards are determined by a
defined formula; factors considered in this formula

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

include financial performance of the Company, return on equity and evaluation of
achievement of strategic and/or operational goals and unit profitability. Based
on the extent to which the Company achieves those objectives, participants,
depending on the Bonus Plan group, may receive from 15% to 40% of base salary.
The Committee reviews both individual and Company goals annually. However, the
Board of Directors has final authority with respect to all bonus awards.
Approximately 4.2% of the Company's compensation to executives of the Company
and the Bank in fiscal 2001 was in the form of bonuses.

         On March 27, 1997, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Long
Term Performance Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") as an incentive for executive
management and members of the Board of Directors to build long-term shareholder
value. The LTIP replaces a similar plan previously adopted by the Bank. The LTIP
provides a mechanism for granting options under the Company's option plan. The
LTIP was amended in February 2000 to provide that options granted under the LTIP
on or after the date of amendment are fully vested on the date of grant. Options
granted prior to amendment of the LTIP become exercisable after the fair market
value per share of the Common Stock exceeds 120% of the exercise price for a
period of 30 consecutive business days, upon the ninth anniversary of the date
of grant or upon a change of control of the Company.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

         Mr. McDonough's salary, bonus and stock options are determined by the
Compensation Committee substantially in accordance with the policies described
above relating to all executives of the Company.

                                 A. Stanley Littlefield

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

         Bruce G. Atwood, Ralph B. Carver, Jr. and A. Stanley Littlefield served
on the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2001. Persons serving on the
Compensation Committee had no relationships with the Company other than their
relationship to the Company as Directors entitled to the receipt of standard
compensation as Directors and members of certain committees of the Board and
their relationship to the Company as stockholders, except as described below
under "Certain Transactions with Management and Others". No person serving on
the Compensation Committee or on the Board of Directors of the Company is an
executive officer of another entity for which an executive officer of the
Company or the Bank serves on the board of directors or on that entity's
compensation committee.

                                PERFORMANCE GRAPH

         The following Performance Graph compares the performance of the
Company's cumulative stockholder return with that of two broad market indices
(the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Stock Market (U.S.)) and a published industry
index (the Nasdaq Bank Stocks) for the most recent five fiscal years. The
cumulative stockholder return for shares of Common Stock and each of the indices
is calculated assuming that $100 was invested on December 31, 1996. The
performance of the indices is shown on a total return (dividends reinvested)
basis. The graph lines merely connect year-end dates and do not reflect
fluctuations between those dates.

401(k) PLAN

         The Bank has a defined contribution plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code for the benefit of its employees, including officers.
Subject to certain eligibility requirements, the 40l(k) plan permits each
participant to defer up to 15% of such participant's annual salary up to a
maximum annual amount ($10,500 in calendar year 2001). The Bank contributes to
the account of each eligible plan participant an amount equal to 3% of the plan
participant's annual compensation and matches 50% of the first 6% of annual
salary contributed by a participant.

RETIREMENT PLAN

         The Board of Directors of the Bank voted to terminate the Bank's
Savings Banks Employees Retirement Association Pension Plan, a qualified,
tax-exempt defined benefit plan, effective on or about December 31, 2000. In
connection with the termination of the Plan, the Bank's Board of Directors also
voted to cease the accrual of pension benefits, effective October 31, 2000.

         As a result of the termination of the Plan, eligible employees were
offered a single sum settlement equal to the value of their benefits under the
Plan. In addition, a portion of the surplus of the Plan has been used to enhance
benefits of eligible employees. Eligible employees who did not roll over these
benefits into other pension vehicles are subject to significant tax penalties.
Distributions were made in February 2002. The following are settlements and
enhancements for the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

         The Company and the Bank have entered into special termination
agreements with Messrs. McDonough, Tierney, Lallo, Berlinghieri and Meehl and
Ms. Mulligan.

         The Agreements provide for severance payments if the officer's
employment with the Company or the Bank is terminated within three years
following a change in control of the Company (as defined in the agreements)
under certain circumstances, including either (1) termination of the officer's
employment by the Company or the Bank for any reason other than death,
deliberate dishonesty with respect to the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate
thereof or conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or (2) resignation
by the officer subsequent to the occurrence of any of the following events: (a)
a reduction in compensation, (b) a significant change in the officer's authority
or responsibility, (c) a reasonable determination by the officer that he is
unable to exercise his prior authority or responsibility as a result of such
change in control or (d) the failure by the Company or the Bank to continue any
material compensation, incentive, bonus or benefit plan (or provide an
appropriate substitute plan) or the failure by the Company or the Bank to
continue the officer's participation therein on a basis not materially less
favorable as existed at the time of the change of control. In such event, the
officer would receive a lump sum payment equal to approximately three times (in
the case of Ms. Mulligan, two times) the officer's average annual compensation
(including bonuses) over the five years prior to the change in control.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control takes place after the
second anniversary of the date on which Ms. Mulligan's employment with the Bank
commenced AND a Terminating Event occurs within three (3) years after such
Change in Control, the Employers shall pay to Ms. Mulligan an amount equal to
(x) three times such "base amount" applicable to the Executive, less (y) One
Dollar ($1.00), payable in one lump-sum payment on the date of termination.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT AGREEMENTS

         Abington Savings Bank has entered into a new supplemental executive
retirement agreement with Mr. McDonough dated as of August 23, 2001 and a
related split dollar agreement for the purpose of providing a supplemental
retirement benefit to Mr. McDonough. Abington Savings Bank has established a
trust for the purpose of holding funds contributed by Abington Savings Bank to
fund this benefit.

         The agreement provides that Mr. McDonough will be entitled to receive
at age 65 an annual supplemental retirement benefit (payable in equal monthly
installments during Mr. McDonough's life or for a minimum of 20 years)
calculated by (x) multiplying (i) 65% times (ii) Mr. McDonough's final average
compensation (as defined in the agreement) and by (y) subtracting from such
result the following: (i) one half of the annual amount payable to Mr. McDonough
as a primary social security retirement benefit at age 65, (ii) the annual
pension payable to Mr. McDonough from defined benefit pension plans at age 65,
as if such pension were paid as a single-life annuity and (iii) the annual
annuity equivalent (as defined in the agreement) for any defined contribution
plans maintained by Abington Savings Bank or Abington during Mr. McDonough's
employment.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

         If Mr. McDonough's employment with the Bank is terminated other than
for cause (as defined in the agreement) prior to his attaining the age of 65,
Mr. McDonough is entitled to receive, at age 65, a lesser benefit.

         If Mr. McDonough dies prior to age 65 while he is employed by Abington
Savings Bank or Abington, in lieu of the benefit provided under his supplemental
executive retirement agreement, his designated beneficiary is entitled to a
benefit equal to three times Mr. McDonough's final average compensation plus the
aggregate amount of all accruals made by Abington Savings Bank or Abington with
respect to the benefit up to the end of the then-preceding year.

         If within three years following a change in control (as defined in the
agreement) Mr. McDonough's employment is terminated for other than cause or
death or Mr. McDonough resigns following the failure of the Board of Directors
to elect him to the office of President and Chief Executive Officer or his
salary, benefits or scope of responsibility are reduced, Mr. McDonough is
entitled to receive the benefit to which he would have been entitled had he
resigned at age 65. If Mr. McDonough dies before age 65, his designated
beneficiary is entitled to receive a benefit equal to three times Mr.
McDonough's final compensation for the three calendar years (out of his final
five calendar years of employment with Abington Savings Bank) during which his
compensation was the highest plus an amount equal to the accruals previously
made by Abington Savings Bank or Abington with respect to the SERP benefit.

         Abington Savings Bank has entered into a supplemental executive
retirement agreement with each of Kevin M. Tierney, Sr. and Robert M. Lallo,
dated as of July 26, 2001, for the purpose of providing a supplemental
retirement benefit to the executives. Pursuant to each of the agreements,
Abington Savings Bank will make an annual contribution to a trust during the
term of the executive's employment with Abington Savings Bank. The executive
becomes fully vested in the funds contributed to the trust (including the
investment proceeds thereon) on the date that is the later to occur of (i) two
years from the date of the agreement or (ii) five years from the date the
executive commenced employment with Abington Savings Bank. In addition, the
executive becomes fully vested upon (i) termination of the executive's
employment by him for good reason (as defined in the agreements), (ii) the
executive's death, (ii) termination of the executive's employment by Abington
Savings Bank without cause (as defined in the agreements) or (iv) a change in
control. Upon a change in control, Abington Savings Bank will make an
irrevocable contribution to the trust in an amount equal to three times the
amount of Abington Savings Bank's annual contribution to the trust. Abington
Savings Bank's obligation to make an annual contribution ceases when the
executive reaches the age of 65 or if his employment terminates for any reason.
Upon termination of the executive's employment, he is entitled to receive, at
age 65, the funds contributed to the trust and the investment proceeds thereon,
provided the executive is vested in the benefit. Abington Savings Bank's annual
contribution for Mr. Tierney is $42,000 and for Mr. Lallo $15,000.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

         The Bank established an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"),
effective as of November 1, 1985. As amended, employees age 18 or older who have
completed at least 500 hours of service with the Bank in a six-month period
beginning with the employee's date of employment or any anniversary thereof are
eligible to participate in the ESOP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each person
who is an employee shall be eligible to participate in the ESOP as of the first
day of the plan year during which he shall have attained the age of 18 and
completed at least twelve months of service with the Bank during which he shall
have completed at least 1,000 hours of service.

         The ESOP is funded by contributions made in cash or stock. Cash
contributions will generally be invested in Common Stock of the Company and
stock contributions will be made in Common Stock of the Company. Benefits may be
paid in shares of Common Stock or in cash, subject to the participant's right to
require payment in shares.

         In November 1993, the ESOP entered into a loan agreement with the Bank
pursuant to which the ESOP borrowed $570,000 to purchase 94,256 shares of Common
Stock. The loan was repaid during 2000. Shares purchased with loan proceeds have
been held in a suspense account for allocation among participants as

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

the loan was repaid. All shares have been allocated. The ESOP's purchases of
additional shares of the Company's Common Stock (including reinvestment of cash
dividends) will be and have been made through periodic purchases on the open
market effected through a broker-dealer, subject to market conditions. The
timing and price of the purchases are in the discretion of the ESOP trustee. An
aggregate of 5,579 shares were allocated to participants for the plan year ended
December 31, 2001.

         Commencing in 2001, the Board of Directors may approve annual cash
contributions to the ESOP, which will be used to purchase shares of the
Company's Common Stock for immediate allocation to participants. The amount of
any such cash contributions will be based on the Company's accomplishment of
financial and strategic goals.

         Contributions to the ESOP and shares released from the suspense account
are allocated among participants on the basis of compensation (including
bonuses). As of January 1, 2002, benefits become 20% vested after one year of
eligible service with an additional 20% becoming vested each year thereafter.
Non-vested benefits that are forfeited are reallocated among remaining
participants in the same manner as contributions. Benefits are payable upon
retirement, death, disability or separation from service with the Bank.
Dividends paid by the Company on allocated shares of Common Stock held in the
ESOP may be paid directly to the participants in cash. The Bank's contributions
to the ESOP are not fixed so future benefits payable under the ESOP cannot be
estimated.

         A Committee consisting of Lewis J. Paragona, Ida C. Frazier and Lynn C.
Neacy administers the ESOP. The trustee of the ESOP is currently James P.
McDonough. Under the ESOP, the Committee is required to solicit instructions
from the participants with respect to voting shares that have been allocated to
such participants, and is required to follow such instructions in directing the
trustee to vote such allocated shares. Upon the direction of the Committee, the
trustee also exercises numerous other powers including the right to sell or
otherwise dispose of Common Stock held by the ESOP.
