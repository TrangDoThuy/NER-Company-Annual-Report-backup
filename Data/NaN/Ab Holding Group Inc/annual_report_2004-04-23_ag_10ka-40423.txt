AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT

Under rules  adopted by the SEC, the Company is required to disclose  whether it
has an "Audit  Committee  Financial  Expert"  serving  on its  Audit  Committee.
Although  management  believes  that at least one member of the Audit  Committee
would qualify as an Audit  Committee  Financial  Expert,  the Company's Board of
Directors has not designated any particular member of the Audit Committee as the
Audit Committee Financial Expert under the SEC's rules. Management believes that
at least one  member of the Audit  Committee  is capable  of: (i)  understanding
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  financial   statements;   (ii)
assessing  the general  application  these  principles  in  connection  with the
accounting for estimates,  accruals and reserves; (iii) analyzing and evaluating
the Company's  consolidated  financial statements;  (iv) understanding  internal
control  over  financial  reporting;   and  (v)  understanding  audit  committee
functions.  All directors  serving on the Audit Committee are  "independent"  as
defined in the NASD Marketplace Rule 4200(a)15. During 2003, the Audit Committee
held five meetings.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH

The following  performance  graph compares  cumulative  total return for Company
stockholders over the past five years against the cumulative total return of the
Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index,  and against the Standard & Poor's  Machinery
Group Index. The graph assumes $100 is invested in Company stock and each of the
other two  indices at the closing  market  quotation  on  December  31, 1998 and
dividends are reinvested.  The stock price performance shown on the graph is not
necessarily indicative of future price performance.

Although the companies  included in the Standard & Poor's  Machinery Group Index
generally have a larger market  capitalization than the Company,  such companies
are  believed to provide the closest peer group  representation  with respect to
the industry served by the Company.

This performance  graph shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into
any filing by the Company under either the  Securities  Act of 1933, as amended,
or the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  except to the extent that
the Company specifically incorporates the same by reference.

BOARD COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The underlying objectives of the Company's  compensation strategy are to attract
and retain the best possible  executive  talent, to motivate those executives to
achieve optimum  operating  performance  for the Company,  to link executive and
stockholder  interests through  equity-based plans and to provide a compensation
package that recognizes  individual  contributions  as well as overall  business
results.  There are three  components to the Company's  executive  compensation:
base salary,  long-term  incentives in the form of stock options,  and incentive
(bonus) payments.  The incentive (bonus) payments are only paid in the event the
Company is profitable as they are based on a percentage of net income.


















                                        4
<PAGE>
Base Salary.  Base salary for each executive officer,  other than for Michael J.
Schoville and Larry R. Inman,  was  subjectively  determined by an assessment of
his  or  her   sustained   performance,   advancement   potential,   experience,
responsibility,  scope and  complexity  of the position,  and current  salary in
relation to salary levels for comparable positions in the industry, based on the
Company's general awareness of such salary levels.

Long-Term  Incentives.  Stock  options  are  periodically  granted  to the Chief
Executive  Officer and other executive  officers to encourage  management of the
Company from the perspective of an owner with an equity interest in the Company.
Vesting is used to  encourage  key  employees  to  continue in the employ of the
Company.

Annual Incentives. The Company's executive officers receive an annual bonus from
the Company under their employment agreements. There were no bonus payments made
in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.

Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Schoville's compensation is based on his employment
arrangement  with the Company,  which provides for a base salary and has a bonus
provision  of 2.5% of the net income of the  Company.  Since the Company was not
profitable for 2003, there was no bonus paid to Mr. Schoville.  Mr.  Schoville's
compensation  as set forth in his  employment  arrangement  is derived  from the
value of his industry  expertise and the  compensation  of  comparable  industry
executives.

The Company does not have any "Excessive  Employee  Remuneration"  as defined in
section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

This report shall not be deemed to be  incorporated by reference into any filing
by the Company  under  either the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended,  or the
Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as  amended,  except to the extent  that the
Company specifically incorporates the same by reference.

                                                     Michael W. Foster, Chairman
                                                     Lemuel E. Cunningham

the  Company.  Board  members  that are not  salaried  employees  of the Company
receive  separate  compensation for Board service.  For 2004, that  compensation
includes:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATTENDANCE FEES:                    $1,000 for each in-person Board meeting
                                    $  500 for each Board committee meeting
                                    Expenses related to attendance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STOCK OPTIONS:                      Per Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Pursuant to the Company's  Non-Employee  Director Stock Option Plan, adopted in
1996, each  non-employee  director receives an initial option to purchase 50,000
shares of the Company's Common Stock, ("Common Stock"),  which vest over a three
year  period at the rate of 40% after  six  months,  40% after two years and 20%
after  three  years.  At each  annual  meeting,  directors  who  have  served  a
three-year  term receive an annual  option to purchase  10,000  shares of Common
Stock  exercisable  six months after the grant date.  The exercise price for the
options granted to  non-employee  directors is equal to the fair market value of
the  Common  Stock on the date of grant.  A total of 300,000  options  have been
granted under the Non-Employee  Director Stock Option Plan, 240,000 of which are
fully vested at December 31, 2003.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

The Company has employment agreements with executive officers, Messrs Inman, Jay
and Wallis and Mrs. Tucker,  which are automatically  renewed on a yearly basis,
unless  terminated by the death or disability of the employee,  or upon at least
six months  written  notification  by either party.  The  employment  agreements
provide for base  compensation,  bonus  compensation  and  participation  in the
employee benefit plans offered by the Company.

On April 11, 2000, the Company  entered into Change of Control  Agreements  with
executive officers,  Messrs Inman, Jay, Wallis and Schuette, and Mrs. Tucker and
key personnel. These agreements provide for payments to the executive officer or
key employee of the Company,  of one year's  annual base salary,  and a bonus of
$5,000 for each year of Company  service in excess of five years, in addition to
outplacement  services and continued Company employee benefit coverage for a one
year period,  in the event that such officer is terminated  without cause within
the period governed by the agreement.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

Lemuel E. Cunningham,  who served on the Compensation  Committee of the board of
directors of the Company  during 2003,  was a Vice President of the Company from
1990-1996.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"),  requires that the Company's officers,  directors or persons who own more
than 10% of the  Common  Stock of the  Company  file  with  the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") initial reports of beneficial  ownership on Form
3 and  reports of  changes in  beneficial  ownership  of Common  Stock and other
equity  securities of the Company on Form 4 and Form 5. Officers,  directors and
holders of more than

                                        7
<PAGE>
10% of the  Common  Stock are  required  by SEC  regulations  to  furnish to the
Company  copies of all Section 16(a)  reports that they file.  Based solely on a
review of the  copies of such  reports  furnished  to the  Company  and  written
representations  with  respect  to the  fiscal  year ended  December  31,  2003,
directors  Cunningham,  Foster,  Weber and  DeMatteo  each  reported  his annual
non-employee  director  stock  option grant on a Form 5 for 2003 instead of on a
Form 4 as required by recently adopted rules.  Consequently,  the report of each
director's annual grant of options was delinquent.

CODE OF ETHICS

The Company has not adopted a Code of Ethics,  within the meaning of  applicable
SEC rules, relating to the conduct of its officers and directors.  The Company's
board of  directors  is  currently  reviewing  this  requirement  and intends to
develop a Code of Ethics during 2004.

--------------------------------------------------------

Currently,  there are 174,000  outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,  Series A,

stockholder  in the Company and partial owner of a company  which  competes with
the Company's  Tri-Dura(R) bags. The supply agreement  provides that the Company
purchase  all of its plastic  rolls,  with  certain  exceptions,  from  Supplier
through at least December 31, 2007.  Thereafter,  either the Company or Supplier
may terminate the Supply  Agreement  upon two years' prior written  notice.  The
Company may purchase  plastic rolls from other  suppliers to the extent Supplier
is unable to supply  plastic  rolls  under the  Supply  Agreement.  The  Company
purchased  all of its  Tri-Dura(R)  rolls  from the  Supplier  during  2003 with
payments to the Supplier of approximately $7 million.
