                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Ag-Bag International Limited


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Ag-Bag International Limited
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. These standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Ag-Bag International Limited as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations,
has a retained deficit, negative cash flows from operations and is out of
compliance with its bank covenants, which raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those
matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

            INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Ag-Bag International Limited


Under date of February 20, 2004, we reported on the balance sheets of Ag-Bag
International Limited as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, as contained in the annual report
on Form 10-K for the year 2003. In connection with our audits of the
aforementioned financial statements, we also audited the related schedule of
Valuation and Qualifying Accounts. This schedule is the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, the schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
