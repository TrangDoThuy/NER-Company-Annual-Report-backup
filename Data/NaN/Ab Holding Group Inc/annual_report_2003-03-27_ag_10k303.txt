ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
-----------------

GENERAL
-------

     Ag-Bag  International  Limited (the "Company" or "Ag-Bag") was incorporated
as a New York  corporation  in  1989.  The  primary  operating  company,  Ag-Bag
Corporation,  a Nebraska  corporation,  was  incorporated  in 1978.  The Company
changed its name in 1990 from AB Holding  Group,  Inc.  to Ag-Bag  International
Limited. In 1994, in an effort to streamline and save  administrative  expenses,
two of the  Company's  operating  subsidiaries,  A.B.  Rental,  Inc.  and Ag-Bag
Corporation  were merged into the Delaware  subsidiary,  ABVIN  Merging Corp. On
January 1, 1995, the Company was merged into its Delaware  subsidiary  resulting
in the  reincorporation  of the Company in Delaware  and a change in its name to
Ag-Bag International Limited.

     The  Company  has  pioneered  an  alternate  method  of  storing  feed  for
livestock.  Traditional  methods of  storing  feed have  included  placing it in
bunkers,  pits, and silos or baling and stacking it. The Company's  method is to
store the feed in huge  plastic  bags of up to 500 feet in  length  and up to 14
feet in  diameter  by  tightly  stuffing  the feed  into the  bag.  The  Company
assembles  the machines  for  stuffing  the feed into the bags.  It has the bags
manufactured  to its  specifications  and then  folds and  distributes  the bags
through  its  dealer  network  and  directly  in an area  where a dealer  is not
present.  The  benefits of bagging the feed  include  reduced  cost,  additional
flexibility  in harvesting  and storing the feed,  enhanced  feed  quality,  and
relatively small capital requirements. The Company also sells ancillary products
that complement the Company's main line of bagging machines and bags.

     The  following  table  identifies  the revenue  from each product line that
accounted for more than 15% of total revenue over the last three years:

  Product                  2000                 2001                  2002

     The  Company  expects  the use of bagging  as a means of silage  storage to
continue  to play a major role in the future  because the quality of stored feed
is better  than other known  competitive  methods,  allowing  farmers to be more
efficient and to produce dairy,  beef, sheep and pork products at a lower price.
The Company  believes the concept of bagging is one way in which  farmers can be
more profitable by reducing, or completely eliminating, the purchase of feed and
grain from outside sources.  Bagging enables the farmer to produce and store the
feed on the farm and provides easier access to the silage,  thereby allowing the
farmer to choose  the  quality of silage to feed at any given  time.  The bagged
feed has shown high quality, allowing for higher production.

     In 1994,  the Company  shipped its first orders to dealers in Japan,  Latin
America and Germany. The Company continues to sell worldwide in Asia, Australia,
New Zealand, Western and Central Europe and the Caribbean. Export sales from the
Company's  United  States  operations  were 6.4% of net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

     In 1997,  the Company  formed a German  joint  venture in which the Company
owns a 50%  interest  and its German  dealer owns the  remaining  50%. The joint
venture folds and distributes  silage bags to the Company's  German and European
dealers.

     The Company is developing other uses for its bagging  technology.  In 1993,
the  Company  adapted  its bagging  machines  to permit  bagging of  compostable
organic matter in the Company's recyclable Tri-Dura(R) plastic bags. The Company
also has developed mobile and stationary plastic recovery units which enable the
Company to bail and pick up the recyclable Tri-Dura(R) plastic bags as a service
to its customers.

SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS

     The core  business  of the  Company  is  historically  seasonal  due to the
harvest seasons in North America and Europe. The Company's machinery tends to be
purchased in anticipation  of the next harvest  season,  so most of the sales of
machinery  occur in the spring and summer.  This  requires  the Company to carry
significant  amounts  of  inventory  to  meet  rapid  delivery  requirements  of
customers.  Bag sales  tend to occur as the  harvest  season  approaches  in the
summer,  and during the harvest  season in the fall.  The Company  took steps to
counteract  some of this  seasonality  by  generating  sales  in  Latin  America
beginning in 1994 and in Australia and New Zealand in 1996.  In September  2002,
the Company took  additional  steps to counteract  seasonality by developing and
introducing a pre-season ordering program,  whereby the Company's dealer's place
their next year's annual product requirements order in advance.  This allows the
Company to know in advance its production  mix which in turn allows  leveling of
production and flexibility in customer shipments.

     Approximately 95% of the Company's business is concentrated in the Northern
Hemisphere  resulting in between 65-70% of the Company's revenue being generated
during the  spring  and  summer  (2nd and 3rd  Quarters).  The  following  table
outlines the percentage of revenue over the past three years by quarter:

FARM EQUIPMENT AND PRODUCTS
---------------------------

     INTRODUCTION.  Silage is made using the Ag-Bag(R)  system by storing forage
crops,  such as corn,  sorghum,  or alfalfa,  under anaerobic  (without  oxygen)
conditions in sealed Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags. The traditional  methods
for  making  silage  involve  storing  it  in  bunkers,  pits  or  silos.  Using
traditional methods,  there is a nutrient loss resulting from a reduction in the
moisture  content of the forage  before  storage.  The moisture  content must be
reduced to compensate for the high oxygen  content of the forage,  which results
from the  inability to pack the forage  tightly  enough.  When the forage is not
packed  sufficiently,  the silage  fermentation  process  produces too much heat
resulting  in an even  greater  loss of  nutrient  value than would occur if the
moisture  content were not reduced.  The loss of nutrient  value  results in the
need for additional food supplements or an increased volume of feed.

     The Ag-Bag(R)  system is an  alternative  to bunkers,  pits and silos.  The
Ag-Bag(R)  bagging  machines push the forage into huge  recyclable  plastic film
Tri-Dura(R) bags with sufficient  compaction to minimize the amount of oxygen in
the bag, which is then sealed tightly when filled.  As a result,  the forage can
be stored with significantly  higher moisture content.  The ability to store the
forage in this manner also reduces the time  required to cut,  prepare and store
the forage thus reducing the loss of nutrients and providing higher quality feed
for production within the farmers' herds.

     AG-BAG(R) FARM EQUIPMENT. The Company's principal line of farm equipment is
marketed under the trade name  "Ag-Bagger(R)."  The Ag-Bagger(R) is available in
three  versions  with a number of  optional  features.  Wide  ranges of optional
features are offered by the Company on its bagging machines in order to meet the
budget needs of the farmer.

     The smallest  version  consists of machines used to load forage into Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags ranging in size from 8 to 10 feet in diameter and 100
to 200 feet in  length.  The  Company  first  introduced  this  version in 1987.
Dairymen use it primarily in smaller dairy and cattle  feeding  operations  with
herds averaging  about 50 head and by cattlemen  feeding up to about 300 head of
feeder cattle.  Most of these machines are powered by the power take-off unit of
a farm tractor and moved by a tractor or other farm vehicle.  In late 2002,  the
Company  introduced  its most basic model of its smaller  bagging  machine,  the
"Personal Bagger".  The retail price for these machines range from approximately
$19,500 to $49,000.

     In 1992, the Company introduced a medium-sized machine that can be operated
by the power take-off unit of a farm tractor or operated  independently  with an
optional  diesel  engine made by  Caterpillar  or Deere & Company.  This machine
allows  farmers to load forage into Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags ranging in
size from 9 to 10 feet in diameter  and 100 to 250 feet in length.  This machine
is  primarily  suitable for use by dairymen  with herds  ranging from 150 to 300
head and by cattlemen  feeding  between 300 and 800 head of feeder  cattle.  The
retail price for this machine ranges from approximately $74,000 to $209,500.

     The largest  version  consists of machines  that can be used to load Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags ranging in size from 9 to 14 feet in diameter and 150
to 500 feet in length.  Primarily dairymen use these machines with herds ranging
from 300 to 2,000 head, by cattlemen with herds ranging from 800 to 15,000 head,
and by custom operators.  A super 12-foot Ag-Bagger(R) was developed in 1989 and
enhanced in 1995. In 2002,  the Company  introduced  its 14-foot  version of the
Ag-Bagger(R)  for use by very  large  dairy and custom  operators  and by cattle
feeding  operations with herds ranging from 15,000 to 25,000 head of cattle. The
larger  machines are available with optional diesel engines made by Caterpillar.
The retail price for the larger  machines range from  approximately  $110,000 to
$310,000.

     In response to a competitor's introduction of a cable-less machine in early
1995, the Company began research and  development on its own cable-less  machine
in early 1996.  The Company began  production of its own  cable-less  machine in
1997. In 1998, the Company  introduced its own cable-less bagging machine called
the HFC (Hydraulic Finger  Controlled)  Silage Bagger.  The introduction of this
machine was in response to what the Company  felt was a change in  direction  of
the industry  towards the  cable-less  machine  design and the latest in bagging
technology. In 1999, the Company continued to develop and improve its cable-less
bagging  machine by developing the Powered  Anchor Control (PAC) system,  and in
2000  introduced  its latest  version of the  cable-less  bagging  machine,  the
HYPAC(R)  (Hydraulic  Powered  Anchor  Control)  system.  The Company offers the
HYPAC(R) model in small,  medium-sized  and large-sized  bagging  machines.  The
retail  price for the  HYPAC(R)  machines  range from  approximately  $49,000 to
$310,000.

     The Company assembles and sells a separate line of related equipment called
the Ag-Bag  Flex-a-Tuber(R) with a retail price ranging from $11,500 to $18,000.
The Flex-a-Tuber(R)  permits farmers to store round-baled alfalfa,  sorghum, and
other forage in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) storage bags. The round bale Flex-a-Tubers(R)
are made in two sizes to permit the bagging of 4 and 5 foot bales. The bales can
be stored in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags up to 200 feet in length. In 2002,
the Company began manufacturing this line of equipment on a made-to-order basis.

     The Company assembles and sells a separate line of related equipment called
the Square Bale Bagger, which retails for approximately  $23,500 to $31,000. The
Square Bale Bagger permits farmers to store square bales of alfalfa, sorghum and
other forage, two bales high in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) flex storage bags. The Square
Bale Bagger permits the bagging of the bales in Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R) flex storage
bags of 7 to 10 feet in  diameter  and up to 200 feet in  length.  In 2002,  the
Company began manufacturing this line of equipment on a made-to-order basis.

     The Company  assembles  and sells the  Ag-Bag(R)  Pro-Grain  Bagger,  which
retails  for  approximately  $31,000.  This  machine is similar in design to the
smallest  Ag-Bagger(R)  machines  but has been  adapted to permit the storage of
grains,  such as corn, rice, wheat and soybeans,  as well as other products,  in
Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags.  The machine  permits the grain to be bagged
without  damaging  the  kernel.  After the grain is bagged and  sealed,  it will
retain the necessary quality for human consumption.

     The Company also  assembles  and sells the Mighty  Bite(R)  front-end  load
bucket.   This   revolutionary   bucket   replaces  the   conventional   bucket.
Hydraulically  operated, the Mighty Bite(R) closes tightly around material, thus
eliminating spillage and increasing load capacity due to compaction. The Company
manufactures the Mighty Bite(R) in sizes ranging from one-half cubic yard to two
cubic yards with a retail price ranging from $3,300 to $4,900.

     The Company adapted its Ag-Bag(R)  bagging  machines for use in large-scale
"in-vessel"  composting  of  organic  matter.  The  bagging  machine  is used in
conjunction with a shredder that shreds the organic material,  which is then fed
into  the  bagging  machine  that  bags  the  compostable   matter  into  Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags.  An air blower is attached to the bag and  circulates
air through the bag during the composting process. The Ag-Bag(R) compost bagging
machines retail for between $49,500 to $130,000.

     AG-BAG TRI-DURA(R) STORAGE BAGS. The Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R)  disposable storage
bags range in size from 8 to 14 feet in  diameter  and 100 to 500 feet in length
and are made of  extruded  plastic.  Rolls of plastic  are  manufactured  to the
Company's  specifications.  The plastic contains special  stabilizers to protect
the bags from deterioration due to exposure to weather and the sun's ultraviolet
rays.  Once a  Tri-Dura(R)  bag is used,  it may be  recycled  or disposed of in
another manner, but may not be reused.

     The  Company  contracts  for the  manufacture  of,  and  sells  Tri-Dura(R)
three-ply bags with a white exterior and black interior  intended for storage of
silage up to 24 months.  The retail price of the bags ranges from  approximately
$225 to $2,100.  The  manufactured  plastic  rolls are shipped to the  Company's

                                       5
<PAGE>
plant in Blair,  Nebraska,  where  they are  folded  and  packed  for sale using
proprietary  folding  techniques.  The proprietary bag folding techniques reduce
bag folding time and allow the bags to uniformly unfold when being filled, which
thereby reduces operational delays.

     AG-BAG(R)  INOCULANT.  The  Company  markets a liquid  inoculant  and a dry
powder inoculant under the trade name Ag-Bag Plus!(R). The inoculant is added to
the  forage  or the  round or square  bales  during  bagging.  It  enhances  the
fermentation  process  for  making  silage in bags,  bunkers,  pits and silos by
substantially  shortening the time  necessary for the creation of the silage.  A
liquid inoculant was developed in 1989 by a Company supplier and introduced into
the market in 1990.  The dry inoculant is produced  from a  proprietary  formula
owned by the  Company  and  developed  by Larry R. Inman and Walter L. Jay.  See
"Executive  Officers of the  Registrant."  The Company also markets an inoculant
designed specifically for composting.

MARKET SIZE
-----------

     The market  for  Ag-Bag(R)  machinery  and  Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  recyclable
storage  bags is primarily  in the dairy and beef cattle  industries.  Silage is
used most often as dairy and beef animal  feed.  It is also used by farmers to a
lesser  extent to feed hogs and sheep.  In 2001,  over 253 million tons of corn,
alfalfa,  sorghum,  silage,  and hay were  harvested  by United  States  farmers
according to the AG IQ Handbook XIX published in 2002 by Agricom,  Inc. (the "AG
Handbook").  Based on AG Handbook  statistics,  the Company estimates that there
are approximately 150,000 dairy, beef, hog, and sheep farms in the United States
that are  potential  customers  for Ag-Bag(R)  farm  equipment  and  Tri-Dura(R)
storage bags; and that only about 8-12% of this group are actually using storage
bags made by the Company or its  competitors.  It further  estimates  that about
50-55% of the bagging industry  customers  purchase silage storage bags from the
Company.  In  addition  to the  U.S.,  the  Company  believes  there  is a large
population of such farms in Canada,  Latin America,  Western and Central Europe,
Australia,  New Zealand,  Asia, and the Caribbean,  where the Company  currently
sells and  distributes its products,  and there is a large  potential  market in
other countries into which the Company may expand.

     The  Company  also  markets a system for  "in-vessel"  composting  which is
designed to  eliminate  odors and control  leachate  inherent  with  composting.
Composting is an alternative for disposing of or eliminating the large number of
organics  from  landfills.  The Company's  primary  focus is currently  directed
towards  municipalities,  private  composters,  military  bases,  zoos  and  the
Company's dairy and beef customers.  The Company currently estimates the size of
the compost  market  within  North  America to be over $2 billion a year.  Until
further  marketing  efforts are made outside North  America,  the Company cannot
estimate  with any  certainty  the foreign  market  size.  However,  the Company
believes that there is a large potential market in other countries into which it
may expand.  No assurance can be given that the  "in-vessel"  composting  system
will be accepted in either the domestic or foreign marketplace.

MARKETING
---------

     The Company markets its Ag-Bag(R) farm equipment, Tri-Dura(R) storage bags,
Ag-Bag  Plus!(R)  and other  inoculants  primarily  through a network  of United
States, Canadian, and international dealers. As of December 31, 2002, there were
59  dealers  serviced  by a  combined  total  of  22  regional  and  territorial
Company-employed  managers and sales support  coordinators.  Most of the dealers
market the entire Ag-Bag(R) line of farm equipment and products;  however,  some
dealers  sell  only  the farm  equipment  and  others  sell  only the  Ag-Bag(R)
inoculants. The Company also sells farm equipment, Tri-Dura(R) storage bags, and
inoculant  directly  to large  customers  in  states  where  there are no nearby
Ag-Bag(R)  dealers.  Beginning in 2002, the Company began focusing its marketing
efforts more on dealer  development and expanding its dealer network rather than
a focus towards direct  selling.  In September 2002, the Company also introduced
its new  pre-season  ordering  program for its  products,  whereby the Company's
dealers place their next year's annual product requirements order in advance.

                                       6
<PAGE>
     The Company  offers  customers the  opportunity  to finance the purchase of
Ag-Bag(R)  farm  equipment   through   unaffiliated   third  parties  who  offer
lease-purchase and wholesale financing.

     The Company  rents used  Ag-Bag(R)  bagging  machines to farmers in various
areas of the United  States.  The  rental  charge is based on the number of bags
purchased and filled with forage.

     Prior to December 31, 1997, the Company  offered a custom  bagging  service
through its subsidiary Ag-Bag Europe PLC in the United Kingdom. The Company sold
its subsidiary that had not been performing at a profitable level due to the BSE
(Mad Cow) problem within the British farming industry on December 31, 1997.

     The Company markets its composting  system through a sublicense that allows
the end user to use the  Ag-Bag(R)  compost  technology.  The  Company  plans to
establish a composting  dealer  network and develop a regional  and  territorial
sales force that will have expertise in  composting.  The timing for these plans
will depend on the pace of market acceptance of the Company's composting system.

     The Company is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers. The
loss of any  single  customer  would not have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's financial condition or results of operations.

     The  Company  maintains  a  website  for use by its  customers,  containing
information about the Company, its products, and educational materials regarding
their use. The website address for Ag-Bag is http://www.ag-bag.com

ASSEMBLY AND MANUFACTURING
--------------------------

     AG-BAG(R) FARM  EQUIPMENT.  The Company buys some of its components for its
bagging  machines  from  various   manufacturers,   manufactures  the  remaining
components,  and  assembles  the  machines  itself.  The medium and large  sized
machines,  composting  machines,  HYPAC(R)  (cable-less)  machines,  Square Bale
Baggers, and  Flex-a-Tubers(R)  are all assembled at the Company's  headquarters
facility  in  Warrenton,  Oregon.  The smaller  machines  are  assembled  at the
Company's Blair, Nebraska plant. In 1999, the Company licensed its German dealer
to manufacture the mid-sized bagging machines for distribution within Europe.

     The Company  assembles  all of its machines in order to better  control the
quality of the farm  equipment.  This method  also  permits the Company to offer
customized  assembly for the end user of its equipment.  The Company can acquire
and install name brand manufactured components specified by the customer in lieu
of those ordinarily installed by the Company.

     AG-BAG TRI-DURA(R)  STORAGE BAGS. All of the three-ply  Tri-Dura(R) storage
bags are  manufactured  for the Company by a single  manufacturer.  The bags are
manufactured  to the Company's  specifications  using a stabilizer that protects
the  plastic  from  becoming  brittle  due to  exposure to weather and the sun's
ultraviolet  light  rays.  The  Tri-Dura(R)  plastic  bags are  made in  various
diameters based on bag orders  received by the Company.  The bags are shipped in
roll form to the Company's plant in Blair,  Nebraska,  where they are folded and
packaged for shipment.

                                       7
<PAGE>
     AG-BAG(R)  INOCULANTS.  The Company purchases on the open market the liquid
and  compost  inoculant.  The  Company  believes  that the  liquid  and  compost
inoculant  will be reasonably  available for purchase on the open market for the
foreseeable  future.  The dry inoculant is produced by the Company at the Blair,
Nebraska  plant  pursuant  to a  proprietary  formula  owned by the  Company and
developed  by Larry R. Inman and Walter L. Jay. See  "Executive  Officers of the
Registrant."

PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS
-------------------------------------

     The Company  purchases its Tri-Dura(R) rolls from a company owned by Steven
G. Ross ("Supplier")  pursuant to a supply agreement.  Steven G. Ross is a 14.9%
stockholder  in the  Company  and owner of a  company  which  competes  with the
Company's  Tri-Dura(R)  bags.  The supply  agreement  provides  that the Company
purchase  all of its plastic  rolls,  with  certain  exceptions,  from  Supplier
through at least December 31, 2007.  Thereafter,  either the Company or Supplier
may terminate the Supply  Agreement  upon two years' prior written  notice.  The
Company may purchase  plastic rolls from other  suppliers to the extent Supplier
is unable to supply plastic rolls under the Supply Agreement.  The Company has a
good relationship with Supplier,  and there are alternative  suppliers available
in the event Supplier is unable to provide rolls.

     Several  manufacturing  companies  manufacture the structural components of
the Company's  farm and composting  equipment in Oregon,  Nebraska and Iowa. The
Company  believes that  alternative  sources of supply are readily  available at
competitive  prices if the present sources of supply should become  unavailable.
The Company is not aware of any raw  materials  shortages or problems with these
suppliers that would adversely affect the Company's operations.

     The Company mixes the dry  inoculant at its Blair,  Nebraska  facility.  It
purchases the ingredients for the dry inoculant from a variety of suppliers. The
Company  purchases the liquid and compost  inoculant from a supplier,  who mixes
the inoculants to the Company's  specifications.  The Company believes there are
various other alternative sources of supply.

COMPETITION
-----------

     As the Company's  corporate  slogan,  the "Complete 1(R),"  indicates,  the
Company  believes  it is the  industry  leader  in the  manufacture  and sale of
complete  sealed feed farm  bagging  systems.  Ag-Bag is the only  company  that
manufactures the full line of equipment,  bags, and other accessories for sealed
feed farm management.  There are three competitors within the United States that
manufacture  similar  silage  bagging  machines.  There  are  also a  number  of
competitors  that  manufacture  bale wrapping  machines,  which compete with the
Company's Flex-a-Tuber(R).  The Company distinguishes itself in the market place
from other  manufactures  by providing a top quality  product,  better  warranty
protection, and customer service.

     The bag  market is highly  competitive.  The  Company  competes  in the bag
market by  providing  what the  Company  believes  to be a superior  product and
better warranty protection at a competitive price. The Company is also offering,
through central pickup and fixed locations in selected  geographic  areas of the
U.S., a recycling service for used Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) bags.

     The Company also competes with companies constructing bunkers and pits and,
to a lesser extent,  silos.  These competitors are mostly smaller companies that
build the  bunkers  and pits for the  farmer,  which the farmer  then fills with
forage using  available or rented farm  equipment  otherwise used in the farming
operation.  While these methods do not require bags or special equipment to fill
the  bags,  the  use of  these  alternatives  involves  a  significant  loss  of
flexibility  in storing  and  harvesting  the feed and an  overall  loss of feed
quality.  Flexibility is lost since  structures  must be permanently  placed and
significant

                                       8
<PAGE>
capital  requirements are necessary to expand them. The feed quality is inferior
because of the amount of oxygen remaining after the forage is placed in the pits
or bunkers.

     The  Company  competes  primarily  with  windrow  turner  manufacturers  in
composting.  Windrow turners compost by turning and watering static piles weekly
and require  containment  of odor and leachate.  These turners are comparable in
price to the Company's  compost  machines.  However,  the  Company's  composting
systems  offer the  advantage of being  self-contained,  thus  reducing odor and
requiring no turning or watering.  There are  approximately  50 manufacturers of
turners. In addition to the windrow turner  manufacturers,  the Company competes
with several companies that manufacture "in-vessel" systems, such as burners and
incinerators for large projects, which generally cost from $1 to $15 million.

     In addition to the current competition,  national competitors may emerge if
the bagging  equipment and storage bag markets continue to grow. These potential
competitors  include  large  farm  equipment  manufacturers  and large  chemical
companies who might decide to manufacture and sell the storage bags.

     The  Company  competes  in its product  markets  primarily  on the basis of
product  quality,  warranty  protection,  and  customer  service.  Some  of  its
competitors are larger and have greater  financial,  marketing,  technical,  and
other resources than the Company.

BACKLOG
-------

     The dollar amount of backlog  orders of the Company that are believed to be
firm as of March 1, 2003, was approximately $12,400,000,  compared to $3,400,000
on March 1, 2002, a 264.71%  increase.  Backlog for 2003 is considerably  higher
than 2002 as a result of the  introduction of the Company's new pre-season order
program,  whereby the Company's  dealers place their next year's annual  product
requirements  order in advance by each October 1st. The Company  introduced this
new program in September 2002 for the 2003-ordering  season.  Backlog,  however,
may not be a meaningful  indicator of future sales. This backlog is seasonal and
is reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
------------------------

     During 2002, the Company focused  research and development  expenditures on
testing a newer design of its larger-sized  silage-bagging  machine, in addition
to further  compost  machine  modification  and  development.  The Company  also
completed  research  on various  projects  undertaken  regarding  new silage and
nutritional studies of bagged feed and their effects on animal production during
the year. The Company also  continues with ongoing  research and testing in this
area as well.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
---------------------

     Compliance with federal,  state and local laws and  regulations  regulating
the discharge of materials into the  environment,  or otherwise  relating to the
protection of the environment, had no material effect upon capital expenditures,
earnings, or competitive positions of the Company during the year ended December
31, 2002.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
----------------------

     The Company  has basic and  improvement  patents in the U.S.,  as well as a
number of patents pending, that encompass machines,  bags and systems for silage
bagging, grain bagging, and hay/straw bale bagging.  Corresponding  applications
have or will be filed in selected foreign  countries.  In addition,  proprietary
rights in the bagging of compost  have been and are being  developed  in the U.S
and in selected foreign countries.

                                       9
<PAGE>
     The Company's  patents on its basic  bagging  machine have been found to be
valid and have been  successfully  defended  in prior  litigation.  The  Company
believes  that it has  developed  its  position in the  industry  partially as a
result of  protection  provided  by these  patents.  The  Company  also owns the
proprietary  formula for making the dry inoculant  marketed under the trade name
Ag-Bag  Plus!(R),  which was developed by Larry R. Inman and Walter L. Jay. (See
"Executive Officers of the Registrant")

     The  names  Ag-Bag(R),  Ag-Bag  Plus!(R),   Bale-Bag(R),   Flex-a-Tuber(R),
Flex-a-Tube(R),  ABCTI System(R),  Mighty Bite(R),  Tri-Dura(R),  and the symbol
"AB"(R) are all  registered  as  trademarks  with the United  States  Patent and
Trademark Office.

     The Company believes that its color scheme and trademarks are well known in
the  industry,  are an important  part of its  business,  and give the Company a
competitive advantage.

EMPLOYEES
---------
     On December 31, 2002, the Company had 91 full-time  employees.  The Company
employs  approximately 130 people during its busy season.  None of the Company's
employees are represented by a union, and the Company believes that its employee
relations are good.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
-------------------

     In early 1990, the Company began  occupying its 30,000 square foot facility
located in Warrenton, Oregon. This facility serves as a warehouse and houses the
major  portion of its silage  bagging  equipment  manufacturing.  The  Company's
administrative  offices are also located  there.  Management  estimates that the
manufacturing  at the  Warrenton  plant is  currently  at  approximately  65% of
capacity.  The Company  occupies  the land  pursuant to a lease that  expires in
2015.

     The Company owns facilities in Blair,  Nebraska,  where the Company:  folds
and  packages  its  Tri-Dura(R)  feed  storage  bags;  prepares and packages its
proprietary   inoculant;   and,  assembles  its  smaller  bagging  machines  and
warehouses  products.  The Blair,  Nebraska facility consists of three buildings

                                       10

comprising   approximately   70,000  square  feet.   Management  estimates  that
manufacturing  at the  Blair  facility  is  currently  at  approximately  70% of
capacity.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
--------------------------

     The Company is one of three  defendants named in two purported class action
lawsuits,  S&S Forage & Equipment Co., Inc. v. Up North Plastics,  et al., filed
February 5, 1998, and Mr. and Mrs. Donald L. Steward v. Up North Plastics,  Inc.
et al.,  filed  September 29, 1999,  both alleging  conspiracy to fix prices and
sales quotas involving silage bag manufacturers and vendors. Class certification
has been  denied in the S&S  Forage  case.  The  defendants  briefed  and argued
motions for summary  judgment in both cases,  which the court  denied under both
cases.  In June 2002,  the U.S.  District  Court for the  District of  Minnesota
dismissed,  in its  entirety,  the Mr.  and Mrs.  Donald L.  Steward v. Up North
Plastics,  Inc.  et al.  case based upon the  plaintiffs'  request to the court.
Furthermore, the plaintiffs in the remaining S&S Forage individual claim filed a
motion before the court  appealing  the May 2000 denial of class  certification.
The defendants  responded  accordingly to the court.  In November 2002, the U.S.
District Court for the District of Minnesota denied the plaintiffs'  motion.  If
the  plaintiffs  were to obtain a  judgment  against  the three  companies,  the
Company could be held jointly and severally  liable.  The Company  believes that
the  remaining  plaintiffs'  individual  claim has no merit,  and the Company is
vigorously defending itself against this claim. The Company continues to believe
that the outcome of the  litigation  will not have a material  adverse impact on
its  financial  condition  or results of  operations.  (See  "Factors  Affecting
Forward-Looking Statements.")

     The  Company  is one of three  defendants  named in a  purported  breach of
contract and product  warranty  lawsuit,  Kevin Sustrik v. Alberta  Ag-Bag Ltd.,
Ag-Bag  International  Ltd.,  and Jim Rakai,  filed June 7, 2000.  The plaintiff
alleged breach of contract and breach of product warranty  relating to a bagging
machine  purchased by the plaintiff  and sought  monetary  damages.  The Company
settled with the plaintiff May 1, 2002;  which  settlement is currently  pending
before the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta,  Canada.  (See "Factors  Affecting
Forward-Looking Statements.")

     The Company is a defendant in an alleged patent infringement lawsuit, Versa
Corporation v. Ag-Bag  International  Ltd., filed October 30, 2000 in the United
States  District  Court for the  District of Oregon.  The claim  alleges  patent
infringement  upon Versa's U.S.  Patent Nos.  5,799,472;  5,894,713;  5,345,744;
5,426,910; and 5,452,562 relating to a bag pan and density control patent for an
agricultural feed bagging machine and composting method patents. Plaintiff seeks
monetary  damages.  On April 2, 2002,  the  defendant was granted its motion for
summary  judgment in the bag pan matter.  The court  concluded that there was no
infringement.  Plaintiff has appealed this decision,  which is currently  before
the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. The density control
matter currently  remains in settlement  negotiations.  In the composting method
patent matter,  the Company  counter-claimed  for a  determination  that Versa's
patents  are invalid  and for  infringement  of the  Company's  U.S.  Patent No.
5,461,843. Versa recently filed a formal stipulation with the court conceding it
cannot prove  infringement under the court's patent claim  construction,  and is
seeking  leave to appeal that  decision.  This matter is scheduled  for trial in
June 2003 and further  pre-trial  procedures  are  pending.  The Company  denies
Versa's  allegations and is vigorously  defending  itself against the claim. The
Company  believes  that the outcome of the  litigation  will not have a material
adverse  impact on its  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.  (See
"Factors Affecting Forward-Looking Statements.")

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT
------------------------------------

     The executive officers of the Company, their respective ages as of March 1,
2003,  business  experience,  and the period for which they have  served are set
forth below. The Board of Directors at the first meeting  following the start of
the new calendar year elects the executive officers annually.  Officers serve at
the  discretion  of the  Board of  Directors.  Beginning  in 2003,  the Board of
Directors voted to separate the position of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
of the Board. As a result,  Michael J. Schoville was promoted to Chief Executive
Officer from his former position of Chief Operating Officer.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The Company's  Common Stock began trading publicly on January 17, 1990,
and was  approved for  quotation  on Nasdaq on April 24, 1990,  under the symbol
"AGBG." In 1997, the Nasdaq listing  requirements were  substantially  expanded.
The Company does not  currently  qualify under the more  stringent  requirements
because the price at which its Common Stock is trading is below the $1 per share
minimum.  The Company was formally  notified on January 13, 1999 that its Common
Stock was delisted from quotation on The Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market for failure to
meet the new listing  requirements.  The Company's Common Stock is now quoted on
the OTC Bulletin Board.

         As of March 1, 2003, there were  approximately 320 holders of record of
the Company's Common Stock. The Company estimates there are approximately  1,700
beneficial holders of the Company's Common Stock. The following table sets forth
the  range of high and low bid  prices  of the  Company's  Common  Stock for the
quarters  indicated  through  the fourth  quarter of 2002 as reported on the OTC
Bulletin Board:

DIVIDENDS
---------

     The  Company  has not paid any  dividends  on its  Common  Stock  since its
inception,  and the Board of Directors  does not  anticipate  declaring any cash
dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable  future.  The Company currently
intends to  utilize  any  earnings  in its  business.  The  Company  may not pay
dividends on Common Stock pursuant to certain loan agreements, or while it is in
arrears in dividends on its preferred stock.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
----------------------------

     The Company's  significant  accounting  policies are described in Note 1 to
the  financial  statements  included  in Item 15 of this form 10-K.  The Company
believes its most critical  accounting  policies include inventory  obsolescence
reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts,  accounting for warranty reserves and
accounting for income taxes.

      The $731,322  estimate for inventory  obsolescence  reserves was developed
using  inventory-aging  reports for finished  goods,  combined  with  historical
usage, and forecasted usage and inventory shelf life. The Company's estimates of
market value incorporate projections of future sales volume by product class. In
estimating  the market  value of parts  inventory  items,  the  Company  reviews
current  inventory  levels  in  relation  to sales  forecasts  and  adjusts  the
valuation reserve accordingly.  For the remaining  categories of inventory,  the
Company  establishes  a  reserve  balance  based on the  aging  of the  specific
inventory items. As trends in these variables change, the percentages applied to
the inventory aging categories are updated.

     The $203,595  estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised of a
specific  account  analysis  and a  general  reserve.  Accounts  where  specific
information  indicates a potential  loss may exist are  reviewed  and a specific
reserve  against  amounts due is recorded.  As  additional  information  becomes
available such specific  account reserves are updated.  Additionally,  a general
reserve is applied based upon historical collection and write-off experience. As
trends in historical  collection and write-offs  change,  the general reserve is
updated.

     The  $177,384  estimate for  warranty  reserve is developed  based upon the
estimated  future costs to be incurred  under the  provisions  of the  Company's
warranty agreements on its bags and machines. The Company reviews its historical
warranty  expense and current  sales trends in specific  products  covered under
warranty, and reserves are updated as trends in these variables change.

(2) Includes loans from shareholders and deferred taxes.
(3) Includes $696 of preferred stock.

                                       16
<PAGE>
      The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  under the asset and  liability
method.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized for the future tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected  to apply to  taxable  income  in the  years in which  those  temporary
differences  are expected to be recovered or settled.  Valuation  allowances are
established to reduce potential  deferred tax assets when it is more likely than
not that all or some  portion  of  potential  deferred  tax  assets  will not be
realized.

</TABLE>

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001
--------------------------------------

      For the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  net  sales  decreased  5.29% to
$27,189,140  compared to $28,708,233 for the year ended December 31, 2001. Sales
were down for the year as a result of drought weather conditions  experienced in
much of the Midwest and upper-Midwestern  United States that greatly reduced the
summer alfalfa harvest for 2002. Additionally, milk prices continued their steep
decline,  which began during the second  quarter of 2002,  to record low levels,
causing  farmers  to become  cautious  on  purchasing  capital  equipment.  Also
contributing  to the decline was  continued  tightening in  agricultural  credit
availability, as a result of the depressed U.S. milk prices, coupled with rising
supplemental grain feed costs during the third quarter of 2002 brought on by the
drought conditions in the U.S.

      This is a shift from the  positive  trends  that could be seen moving into
the first quarter of 2002.  These  positive  trends  included  stabilizing  milk
prices,  continued  optimism that milk prices in the U.S. would remain above the
record  low  levels of the year 2000  throughout  2002 and  continued  easing of
credit by financial  institutions for the farming sector that,  coupled with the
interest rate  reductions of 2001,  allowed  farmers to be more  optimistic  and
resume capital expenditures.  Sales were down for the year despite this positive
sentiment seen during the first quarter of 2002,  which began eroding during the
second  quarter and continued  throughout  the  remainder of 2002.  Supplemental
grain feed costs  remained  low during  the first two  quarters  of 2002,  which
tended to improve the availability of farm operating funds.  However, this trend
reversed during the third quarter as discussed above.  Throughout  2002,  strong
competition  in the silage bag market  continued,  as farmers  look for the most
economical bag, with lesser  consideration to overall quality,  customer service
and recycling of the used plastic silage bags offered by the Company.

                                       17
<PAGE>
      Machine  sale  revenue for the year  declined  3.61% and bag sale  revenue
declined 5.54% compared to 2001. Machine sale revenue for the year declined as a
result of a decrease in the Company's  smaller unit bagging machine sales during
the second and third  quarters  of 2002  compared  to 2001,  resulting  from the
drought and milk price conditions previously discussed. As a percentage of total
revenue for the year 2002, machine and bag revenue was unchanged.  (See "Item 1.
Business - General.")  Machine  sales are directly  tied to farmers'  income and
therefore  their ability to purchase new equipment.  The total number of bagging
machines that are in the  marketplace  drives the Company's bag and parts sales.
However,  there is not a perfect correlation between the Company's bag sales and
machine sales, as the Company's and competitors' bags are interchangeable on all
bagging  machinery  in the  industry.  The  Company  cannot  estimate  with  any
certainty the total number of machines or bags used in the industry.

      For the year ended  December  31, 2002,  the Company sold four  composting
systems in addition to compost bag sales,  generating  approximately $592,000 in
revenue,  compared to ten systems  sold and compost bag sales for the year ended
December 31, 2001,  generating  approximately  $1.3 million in revenue.  Compost
sales  were down for the year as a result of  current  economic  conditions  and
tight budgetary constraints for the Company's potential end users in the U.S.

      Although  the Company  sells its  products  primarily  through a worldwide
dealer network, certain sales are made directly to large volume customers when a
dealer is not present in the customer's  geographic market. For each of the last
three years,  the Company  estimates that direct sales make up between 33-38% of
total  sales.  The gross  margin  realized  on the  Company's  direct  sales are
typically  within 1-3% of those sales  realized  through  the  Company's  dealer
network.  However, various economic, volume and market factors in the geographic
area impact the ultimate margin. The Company  anticipates its sales mix to begin
to favor  more  dealer  sales in the  future as a result of its  change of sales
focus during the later half of 2002. (See "Item 1. - Business - Marketing.")

      The  Company  continued   evaluating  selling  its  bagging  machines  via
e-commerce and concluded that e-commerce is not currently a viable  distribution
avenue  for  its  machinery.   This  is  due  to  the  complexity  and  required
understanding  of the end user's  needs and farming  operation,  which  requires
discussion in an individual  setting with a Company  sales  representative.  The
Company  however,  will continue to evaluate  whether to offer some of its other
products via e-commerce at some point in the future.

      International  sales for the  Company in 2002 were down in  comparison  to
2001 due to continued  economic  uncertainty  affecting the  international  farm
economy.  International  sales to Canada and Latin America saw a slight increase
in 2002,  while  sales to  Germany  saw a  decline  for the year.  In 1999,  the
Company's  German  dealer  began  manufacturing  mid-sized  bagging  machines in
Germany under a license from the Company. Therefore, the Company no longer sells
mid-sized machines directly to its German dealer.  Instead, the Company receives
a royalty fee for each  mid-sized  machine sold by its German  dealer,  which is
recorded as other income.  In 1997, the Company formed a German joint venture in
which the Company owns a 50% interest and its German  dealer owns the  remaining
50%. The joint venture  distributes  bags to the  Company's  German and European
dealers.  The  Company's  earnings  from the joint venture are reported as other
income and are accounted for using the equity method. Approximately $3.7 million
in bag sales were  distributed  through the venture  during 2002, an increase of
12%, compared to approximately $3.3 million in bag sales for 2001.

      Gross profit as a percentage of sales  decreased  1.43% for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to 2001.  The decrease for the year was the result of
1) lower sales volumes to cover fixed  operating  overheads,  2) higher  machine
warranty costs (related largely to the Company's  large-sized bagging machines),
3) lower margins on the Company's used  equipment sold during the year,  and, 4)
lower  margins on bags in certain  highly  competitive,  high volume  geographic
areas.  The decrease was partially  offset by improved  margins on the Company's
"core" smaller bagging machines from production  improvements  made during 2002.
Also contributing to the decline for the year was the mix of machine

                                       18
<PAGE>
models  sold  during  the year,  which saw a 16%  increase  in unit sales of the
Company's larger-sized bagging machines.  Larger-sized bagging machines generate
a lower  overall  margin for the Company  than its "core"  small  sized  bagging
machine. (See "Item 1. Business - Farm Equipment and Products.")

      Selling  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased  1.61% to
$3,496,672  compared to  $3,441,197  for the year ended  December 31, 2001.  The
increase  for the year  was the  result  of  increased  advertising,  promotion,
meeting,  and  dealer  incentive  costs,  partially  offset by lower  personnel,
benefit,  and travel costs  associated with sales  personnel  reductions made in
2002 in  connection  with the shift more towards  selling  through the Company's
dealer  network  (See  "Item 1. - Business -  Marketing."),  coupled  with lower
commissions from lower sales volumes for the year.

      Administrative  expenses for the year ended  December  31, 2002  increased
4.32% to $2,739,811 compared to $2,626,268 for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The increase for the year was the result of higher  professional fees related to
ongoing  patent  litigation  and  increases in  administrative  salary,  general
office,  annual  meeting and insurance  expense,  partially  offset by lower bad
debt, employee benefit, and director fee expenses.

      Research and  development  expenses  for the year ended  December 31, 2002
increased 2.91% to $219,980 compared to $213,757 for the year ended December 31,
2001.  The increase for the year was the result of new research and  development
on testing a newer design of the Company's larger-sized  silage-bagging machine,
in addition to further compost machine modification and development. The Company
also completed research on various projects undertaken  regarding new silage and
nutritional studies of bagged feed and their effects on animal production during
the year, and is continuing research and testing in this area as well.

      Interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased 11.70% to
$314,068 compared to $355,686 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease
for the year was the  result of lower  interest  rates on the  Company's  credit
line,  partially offset by the Company  utilizing a larger portion of its credit
facilities through the third quarter of 2002.

      Joint venture  equity and royalty  income for the year ended  December 31,
2002  increased  5.39% to  $315,196  compared  to  $299,065  for the year  ended
December 31, 2001.  The increase for the year was the result of increased  sales
from the joint venture during the year (see the  international  sales discussion
above) coupled with a slight increase in folding  royalties,  as plastic tonnage
folded in 2002 by the German joint venture increased approximately 12% from 2001
tonnage folded. (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data".)

         The Company's  effective tax rate for the year ended  December 31, 2002
was (45%).  This was due to 1) the fact the Company  incurred a net loss for the
year, 2) the recognition of research and development credits associated with its
2002 activities,  3) the fact the Company's income from its German joint venture
is not  taxable  in the  United  States,  and  4)  the  extraterritorial  income
exclusion provisions of the current United States tax code. In 2002, the Company
generated net general business tax credit benefits of approximately $9,000.

      Net loss for the year ended  December 31, 2002 was $663,988  compared to a
net loss of $164,150 for the year ended  December 31, 2001.  The decline for the
year  was  the  result  of  lower  sales,  lower  gross  profit  resulting  from
competition  and mix of bagging  machinery  sold during the year,  coupled  with
increased  selling,  administrative,  and research expense,  partially offset by
higher income from the Company's German joint venture and lower interest costs.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000
--------------------------------------

      For the year  ended  December  31,  2001,  net  sales  decreased  8.72% to
$28,708,233  compared to $31,451,150 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Sales
were down for the year, in spite of several  positive  trends that were starting
to be seen towards the latter half of the year.  During the first quarter of the
year,  milk  prices  in the U.S.  continued  at very  low  levels  coupled  with
continued  tightening of credit,  especially in the U.S.  farming sector,  which
caused farmers to remain cautious about  purchasing farm machinery and equipment
into the first half of the year,  in spite of  declining  interest  rates during
this period.  Continued intense competition in the silage bag and machine market
was seen  during  the  year,  as  farmers  look for the most  economical  bag or
machine, without considering overall quality,  customer service and recycling of
the used bags  offered by the Company.  Positive  trends that began to emerge in
the second half of the year included stabilizing milk prices, continued optimism
that milk  prices in the U.S.  will remain  above last year's  record low levels
through 2002 and continued  easing of credit by financial  institutions  for the
farming sector that,  coupled with the interest rate reductions of 2001, allowed
farmers to be more optimistic and resume capital  expenditures and purchase farm
equipment.  Throughout  2001,  supplemental  grain feed costs also remained low,
which tends to improve the availability of farm operating funds.

      Machine  sales  for the year were  flat and bag  sales  were  down  18.43%
compared to 2000.  The positive  trends  discussed  above can be seen in machine
sales during the second half of 2001.  Machine  sales at September 30, 2001 were
down 3% for the year in comparison to 2000.  This  difference was made up during
the last quarter of 2001 to bring  machine sales flat for the year in comparison
to 2000.  As a  percentage  of total  revenue  however,  machine  sales for 2001
increased 4% and bag sales for 2001 decreased 5% compared to 2000. (See "Item 1.
Business - General.")  Machine  sales are directly  tied to farmers'  income and
therefore  their ability to purchase new equipment.  Bag sales for the year were
down largely due to intense  competition in key dairy states, as farmers utilize
the most economical bag available without  considering  quality of the Company's
products and its recycling program. The Company's bag and parts sales are driven
by the total number of bagging  machines that are in the  marketplace.  However,
there is not a perfect  correlation  between the Company's bag sales and machine
sales, as the Company's and competitors' bags are interchangeable on all bagging
machinery in the industry.  The Company  cannot  estimate with any certainty the
total  number of machines or bags used in the  industry.  In addition to compost
bag  sales,  the  Company  sold ten  composting  systems  during  the year ended
December 31, 2001 (generating approximately $1.3 million in revenue) compared to
twelve  systems  sold  for  the  year  ended   December  31,  2000   (generating
approximately $1.2 million in revenue).

      Although  the Company  sells its  products  primarily  through a worldwide
dealer network, certain sales are made directly to large volume customers when a
dealer is not present in the customer's  geographic market. For each of the last
three years,  the Company  estimates that direct sales make up between 33-38% of
total  sales.  The  Company  expects its sales mix to begin to favor more direct
sales in the future,  especially if the Company begins to offer  e-commerce as a
method for ordering the Company's  products.  The Company  continues to evaluate
methods for selling its products via  e-commerce  and  anticipates  beginning to
offer  e-commerce as a purchase  method  sometime  during 2002. The gross margin
realized on the Company's  direct sales are typically within 2-4% of those sales
realized through the Company's dealer network. However, various economic, volume
and market factors in the geographic area impact the ultimate margin.

      International  sales for the  Company in 2001 were down in  comparison  to
2000 due to continued poor economic conditions affecting the farm economy in the
Latin  American/Mexico  market.  In 1999,  the  Company's  German  dealer  began
manufacturing  mid-sized  bagging  machines in Germany  under a license from the
Company.  Therefore,  the Company no longer sells mid-sized machines directly to
its  German  dealer.  Instead,  the  Company  receives  a  royalty  fee for each
mid-sized machine sold by its German dealer,  which is recorded as other income.
In 1997,  the Company  formed a German joint venture in which the Company owns a
50% interest and its German  dealer owns the  remaining  50%.

                                       20
<PAGE>
The joint venture distributes bags to the Company's German and European dealers.
The  Company's  earnings from the joint venture are reported as other income and
are accounted  for using the equity  method.  Approximately  $3.3 million in bag
sales were  distributed  through the venture  during  2001,  an increase of 32%,
compared to approximately $2.5 million in bag sales for 2000.

      Gross profit as a percentage  of sales  declined  5.12% for the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to the same period in 2000. The decline resulted from
lower  sales  volumes to cover fixed  operating  overheads,  coupled  with lower
margins on bags in certain highly competitive, high volume geographic areas. The
decline was also the result of lower overall margins on machinery as a result of
machine  competition  (particularly  in the  larger-sized  bagging  machines) in
certain  areas of the U.S.,  coupled with the mix of machine  models sold during
the  year,  which  saw a 12%  increase  in unit  sales of  larger-sized  bagging
machines.  Larger sized bagging machines generate a lower overall margin for the
Company than its "core" small sized  bagging  machine.  (See "Item 1. Business -
Farm Equipment and Products.")

      Selling  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased  3.34% to
$3,441,197  compared to  $3,329,880  for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  The
increase  for the  year was the  result  of  increases  in  personnel,  benefit,
commission,  advertising and  promotional  expenses,  partially  offset by lower
volume discounts due to lower sales volumes for the year.

      Administrative  expenses for the year ended  December  31, 2001  increased
3.05% to $2,626,268 compared to $2,548,446 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The  increase  for the year was the result of  increased  depreciation  from the
Company's   implementation  of  a  new  computer  system,  coupled  with  higher
professional  fees  related to ongoing  litigation  and  increases  in  employee
benefit costs and insurance expenses,  that were offset by the Company canceling
a discretionary matching annual benefit.

      Research and  development  expenses  for the year ended  December 31, 2001
increased  56.96% to $213,757  compared to $136,186 for the year ended  December
31, 2000. The increase for the year was the result of new research on silage and
nutritional  studies  of bagged  feed and their  effects  on animal  production,
coupled with ongoing  research and testing related to silage bagging and compost
machine development.

      Interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased 22.03% to
$355,686 compared to $456,158 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease
for the year was the result of the Company  utilizing  a smaller  portion of its
credit facilities and from lower interest rates on its borrowings.

      Joint venture  equity and royalty  income for the year ended  December 31,
2001  increased  66.42% to  $299,065  compared  to  $179,703  for the year ended
December 31, 2000.  The increase for the year was the result of increased  sales
from the joint venture during the year (see the  international  sales discussion
above) coupled with increased  folding  royalties,  as plastic tonnage folded in
2001 by the joint venture increased  approximately 46% from 2000 tonnage folded.
(See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data".)

      The Company's  effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 was
(59%).  This was due to the fact the  Company  incurred  a net loss for the year
coupled with the recognition of research and development credits associated with
its 2001  activities.  In 2001, the Company  generated net general  business tax
credit benefits of approximately $75,000. In 2000, the Company underwent a study
with a  consulting  firm to  determine if costs  associated  with the  Company's
research and  development  activities were eligible for research and development
tax credits in its open tax years. The Company completed the study and filed the
necessary  forms for its 1996  through  1999 tax  years  during  the year  2000,
generating net general business tax credit benefits of  approximately  $270,000.
Excluding the benefit of the general business tax credits,  the effective income
tax rate would have been (39%) for the year ended December 31, 2001.

                                       21
<PAGE>
      Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $164,150 compared to net
income of $521,814 for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  The decline for the
year  was  the  result  of  lower  sales,  lower  gross  profit  resulting  from
competition  and  product  mix sold  during  the year,  coupled  with  increased
selling, administrative, and research expense, partially offset by higher income
from the Company's German joint venture and lower interest costs.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
--------------------------------

        In December  2002,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB")
issued Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 148, "Accounting
for Stock-Based  Compensation--Transition  and Disclosure--an  amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123." This Statement  amends FASB  Statement No. 123,  "Accounting
for Stock-Based  Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for
a voluntary  change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee  compensation.  In  addition,  this  Statement  amends  the  disclosure
requirements  of Statement 123 to require  prominent  disclosures in both annual
and interim financial  statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The
Company's  management  intends to continue using the intrinsic  value method for
stock-based  employee  compensation  arrangements  and therefore does not expect
that the application provisions of this statement will have a material impact on
the Company's financial statements.

     In June  2002,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  146,  "Accounting  for  Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." This Statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs  associated with exit or disposal  activities
and  nullifies  Emerging  Issues Task Force (EITF)  Issue No.  94-3,  "Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity  (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)."  The statement
is effective for exit or disposal  activities  that are initiated after December
31, 2002, with early application  encouraged.  The Company's management does not
expect that the  application  of the  provisions of this  statement  will have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements.

     In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements
No.  4,  44,  and  64,  Amendment  of  FASB  Statement  No.  13,  and  Technical
Corrections." This Statement rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, "Reporting Gains and
Losses from  Extinguishment  of Debt," and an amendment of that Statement,  FASB
Statement  No.  64,  "Extinguishments  of  Debt  Made  to  Satisfy  Sinking-Fund
Requirements."  This Statement also rescinds FASB Statement No. 44,  "Accounting
for Intangible  Assets of Motor  Carriers." This Statement amends FASB Statement
No. 13,  "Accounting  for  Leases," to eliminate  an  inconsistency  between the
required accounting for sale-leaseback  transactions and the required accounting
for certain lease  modifications  that have economic effects that are similar to
sale-leaseback   transactions.   This   Statement  also  amends  other  existing
authoritative  pronouncements  to make various  technical  corrections,  clarify
meanings,  or  describe  their  applicability  under  changed  conditions.   The
Company's  management  does not expect that the application of the provisions of
this  statement  will  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's   financial
statements.






                                       22
<PAGE>
     In July  2001,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  143,  "Accounting  for  Asset
Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses the accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated  asset  retirement  costs.  SFAS No.  143 will be  effective  for the
Company in the first quarter of 2003. The Company's  management  does not expect
that the  application  of the  provisions of this statement will have a material
impact on the Company's financial statements.

     In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,  "Consolidated  Financial  Statements," and
requires existing  unconsolidated  variable interest entities to be consolidated
by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks
among  parties  involved.  The  Company's  management  does not expect  that the
application of the provisions of this interpretation will have a material impact
on the Company's financial statements.

     In November 2002, FASB issued  Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others." This  interpretation  elaborates on the
disclosures  to be made by a guarantor  in its  financial  statements  about its
obligations under certain  guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that
a  guarantor  is required to  recognize,  at the  inception  of a  guarantee,  a
liability  for  the  fair  value  of the  obligation  undertaken  in  issuing  a
guarantee.  The Company has complied with the disclosure requirements of FIN 45.
The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions shall be applied on a
prospective  basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The
Company's  management  does not expect that the application of the provisions of
this  interpretation  will have a  material  impact on the  Company's  financial
statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
-------------------------------

     The  seasonal  nature of the  northern  hemisphere  farming  industry,  the
production  time for  equipment  and the time  required to prepare  bags for use
requires the Company to  manufacture  and carry high  inventories  to meet rapid
delivery  requirements.  In particular,  the Company must maintain a significant
level of bags during the spring and summer to meet the sales demands  during the
harvest  season.  The Company uses working  capital and trade credit to increase
its inventory so that it has sufficient  inventory  levels available to meet its
sales demands.

      The Company  relies on its suppliers to provide trade credit to enable the
Company to build its inventory. The Company's suppliers have provided sufficient
trade  credit  to meet the  demand  to date and  management  believes  this will
continue.  No assurance  can be given that  suppliers  will  continue to provide
sufficient trade credit in the future.

      Accounts  receivable  decreased  52.38% at December 31, 2002 to $1,158,927
compared to $2,433,842  at December 31, 2001.  The decrease for the year was the
result of the Company changing its collection  methods during the fourth quarter
of 2002 whereby the Company's  customers no longer have open account terms.  For
new purchases, the Company's customers now have the option to pay in advance for
their  order,  utilize  their own  established  credit,  or  utilize  one of the
Company's third-party financing sources or programs offered for their purchases.
The Company has  established  adequate  reserves  ($203,595 at December 31, 2002
compared to $203,350 at December 31, 2001)  against  accounts  receivable in the
event that some of the remaining accounts become uncollectable.

      Inventory  decreased 9.62% at December 31, 2002 to $6,051,720  compared to
$6,695,894  at December 31, 2001.  The decrease in inventory  resulted  from the
Company's  continued  efforts to streamline its inventory and more closely match
its  production  with  planned  inventory  requirements.

                                       23
<PAGE>
Contributing  to these  efforts  was the  implementation  of the  Company's  new
pre-season  ordering  program  introduced  in  September  2002.  (See  Item 1. -
"Business - Marketing.")

      Other  current  assets  decreased  11.82% at December 31, 2002 to $198,877
compared to $225,544 at December  31,  2001.  The  decrease  was the result of a
decrease in deposits and prepaid expenses.

      Intangible  assets at December 31, 2002  decreased to $11,511  compared to
$18,893 at December 31, 2001. The decrease was the result of normal amortization
expense for the year.

      Other assets increased 1.85% at December 31, 2002 to $490,628  compared to
$481,704 at December  31,  2001.  The increase for the year was the result of an
increase in the cash surrender  value of life insurance  policies  maintained by
the Company under which it is the beneficiary.

      The Company has an  operating  line of credit with a limit of  $5,000,000,
secured by  accounts  receivable,  inventory,  fixed  asset  blanket and general
intangibles,  and bears  interest  at the bank's  prime  rate plus  1/4%.  As of
December  31, 2002,  $384,725 had been drawn under the credit line.  The line of
credit is  subject  to certain  net worth and  EBITDA  covenants,  and an annual
capital expenditure limit.  Subsequent to year-end, the Company reduced its line
of credit to  $2,500,000  and the interest rate was adjusted to the bank's prime
rate plus 1 1/4%.  Management  believes that funds generated from operations and
the Company's  operating line of credit will be sufficient to meet the Company's
cash  requirements  through  2003.  The  Company's  line of credit is subject to
annual renewal at June 1.

      On December 18, 2000, the Company  entered into an agreement with Dresdner
Bank to guarantee up to 511,292 Euro ($535,987 US) as security for an additional
cash credit facility of the Company's  German joint venture.  There was -0- Euro
outstanding under this additional cash credit facility at December 31, 2002.

      Accounts  payable  increased  34.31%  at  December  31,  2002 to  $903,309
compared to $672,563 at December  31,  2001.  The  increase for the year was the
result of the Company  continuing  its  manufacturing  process during the fourth
quarter  (resulting from the Company's new pre-season  order program whereby the
Company  is trying  to level  out its  production  process),  coupled  with some
extended term payables provided by some of the Company's principal suppliers.

      Accrued  expenses and other current  liabilities in total increased 16.32%
at December  31, 2002 to  $1,135,608  compared to $976,302 at December 31, 2001.
The increase in total  accrued  expenses and other current  liabilities  for the
year was the result of increased  dealer  incentives  and volume rebate  expense
resulting  from the Company's new pre-season  order program  coupled with higher
machine  warranty  costs,  which were offset by lower  payroll and benefit costs
from sales staff  reductions,  in addition to lower general  accruals  resulting
from lower sales for the year.

      In 1997, the Nasdaq listing requirements were substantially  expanded. The
Company does not currently qualify under the more stringent requirements because
the  price at which  its  Common  Stock is  trading  is below  the $1 per  share
minimum.  The Company was formally notified on January 13, 1999, that its Common
Stock was delisted from quotation on The Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market for failure to
meet the new listing  requirements.  The Company's Common Stock is now quoted on
the OTC Bulletin Board. The removal from quotation on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market
could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on the  Company's  ability  to  raise
additional  equity  capital  in a  public  stock  offering  should  that  become
necessary.

FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
--------------------------------------------

You should carefully  consider the following factors  regarding  forward-looking
statements and other information  included in this Annual Report.  The risks and
uncertainties  described below are not the only ones we face.  Additional  risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
also may impair our business operations.  If any of the following risks actually
occur,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  operating  results  could  be
materially adversely affected.

o    We are dependent on the Dairy Industry

         More than 75% of our revenues come from the dairy industry.

o    A downturn in the dairy industry could cause a reduction in our revenues.

         Our sales are highly  correlated  with the price of milk  products  and
         revenues of the dairy industry. When dairy farmers make money, they buy
         our  products.  When  dairy  farmers  are not making  money,  our sales
         decline.

o    A sharp  decline in the health of the  farming  sector of the U.S.  economy
     could cause a reduction in our revenue.

         If a reduction in  availability of credit in the farming sector occurs,
         or, interest rates begin to rise, our sales may decline as farmers will
         find it more  difficult to purchase  capital  equipment  and may become
         more cautious on incurring additional farm debt.

o    Our revenues are historically seasonal and dependent on weather conditions.

         Our core business is dependent on weather conditions during the harvest
         seasons in North America and Europe.  Adverse weather conditions affect
         farmers'  crops  and  reduce  demand  for our  products.  Approximately
         65%-70% of our  revenue  is  historically  generated  in the second and
         third  quarters.  In September 2002 however,  the Company took steps to
         begin to counteract some of this  seasonality  with the introduction of
         its pre-season order program.

                                       25
<PAGE>
o    We may not gain market acceptance of our new pre-season order program.

         The Company introduced a new pre-season order program in September 2002
         for use by the Company's  dealers in placing  their entire  anticipated
         next  year's  product  order.  This is the first time the  Company  has
         introduced such a  comprehensive  program and no assurance can be given
         that it will be fully accepted in the marketplace.

o    We may lose the class action lawsuit pending against us.

         A class action  lawsuit  alleging  antitrust  violations has been filed
         against  others and us. If our effort to dismiss or  favorably  resolve
         the suit fails, we could incur  additional and  significant  litigation
         costs and experience a drain on management and other resources.  If the
         plaintiffs succeed in establishing  liability and obtain a judgment for
         damages, the award could exceed our entire net worth.

o    We may lose the product warranty lawsuit pending against us.

         A product  warranty  lawsuit  was filed  against  others and us. If our
         effort to dismiss or favorably  resolve the suit fails,  we could incur
         additional and significant  litigation  costs and experience a drain on
         management and other resources.

o    We may lose the alleged Versa patent  infringement  lawsuit pending against
     us.

         An alleged  patent  infringement  lawsuit has been filed against us. If
         our effort to dismiss or  favorably  resolve the suit  fails,  we could
         incur  additional  and  significant  litigation  costs and experience a
         drain on management and other resources.

o    Our intellectual property protection may not be adequate.

         We have patents on our basic bagging  machines and patents  pending for
         additional machines, bags and systems for silage bagging, grain bagging
         and  hay/straw  bale  bagging.  We may not obtain these patents and our
         patents may not withstand litigation challenges.  If our patents do not
         withstand  litigation  challenges,   our  rights  in  bag  and  machine
         technology could be diminished or eliminated. Moreover, the issuance of
         patents  covering any of our products  may be  insufficient  to prevent
         competitors  from  duplicating  our products.  The patent laws of other
         countries  may differ from those of the United  States as to the patent
         ability of our products  and  processes,  and the degree of  protection
         afforded by foreign  patents may be  different  from that in the United
         States.

o    We rely on one principal supplier for our bags.

         We purchase  nearly all of our bags from one supplier under a long-term
         requirements  contract.  Any  disruption of the  manufacturing  process
         could  affect  that  company's  ability to supply our needs,  and could
         adversely affect our sales.





                                       26
<PAGE>
o    Our pricing is dependent on the price of resin.

         The prices that we pay for bags, which account for  approximately  half
         of our  annual  sales,  are  fixed  annually  in  advance  and are tied
         directly to the price of resin.  Resin  prices have  historically  been
         subject to significant price volatility. Increases in the price of bags
         could  adversely  affect  our  profit  margins if we are unable to pass
         along the price  increase,  and would  likely  affect our  revenues  if
         alternatives to our product become more attractive because of the price
         increases.

o    Our  stock is quoted on the OTC  Bulletin  Board,  which may make the stock
     more difficult to sell.

         We no longer satisfy the criteria for continued quotation on The Nasdaq
         SmallCap  Market.  Our stock is,  instead,  quoted on the OTC  Bulletin
         Board.  As a result,  our  shareholders  may find it more  difficult to
         dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of,
         our  common  stock,  and the  market  price  for our  common  stock may
         decline.  Trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of
         Rule 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under
         this  rule,  broker/dealers  who  recommend  low-priced  securities  to
         persons other than established  customers and accredited investors must
         satisfy  special sales practice  requirements,  including a requirement
         that they make an individualized written suitability  determination for
         the purchaser and receive the purchaser's  written consent prior to the
         transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform
         Act of 1990 also requires additional  disclosure in connection with any
         trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock (generally any equity
         security  not  traded on an  exchange  or  quoted on Nasdaq  that has a
         market  price  of  less  than  $5.00  per  share,  subject  to  certain
         exceptions),   including  the  delivery,   prior  to  any  penny  stock
         transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market
         and  the  risks   associated   with  the  penny  stock  market.   These
         requirements  could severely  limit the market  liquidity of our common
         stock and the ability of our  shareholders  to dispose of their shares,
         particularly in a declining market.


ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
--------------------------------------------------------------------

         Market risk is the exposure to loss  resulting from changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates,  commodity prices and equity prices. The
primary market risk to which the Company is exposed is interest rates.

         The  Company's  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates is  minimal.
Primarily all of the Company's  long-term debt is fixed rate. The Company's line
of  credit  is based  on the  prime  rate  plus 1 1/4%  and one  long-term  debt
instrument is based on the prime rate plus 3/4%.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Ag-Bag International Limited


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Ag-Bag International  Limited
as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  and the related  statements of operations and
comprehensive  income (loss),  shareholders'  equity, and cash flows for each of
the years in the  three-year  period ended  December 31, 2002.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Ag-Bag International Limited as
of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  and the results of its  operations  and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
          ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION  OF  BUSINESS - Ag-Bag  International  Limited  (the  Company)  is a
Delaware corporation. The Company's primary operations include the manufacturing
and sale of machines and related bags used in the agriculture  industry to store
feed for  livestock,  grain and other  products.  The Company also  manufactures
machines and bags for composting. The Company's primary market is North America;
however, it sells products worldwide.

The Company's  common stock began trading  publicly on January 17, 1990,  and is
traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, under the symbol "AGBG".

STATEMENTS  OF CASH FLOWS - For purposes of the  statements  of cash flows,  the
Company  considers all highly  liquid  investments  with original  maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

The Company transferred $476,214, and $139,432 in 2001, and 2000,  respectively,
from rental  equipment to inventory  held for sale.  In 2002,  2001 and 2000 the
Company  transferred  $331,726,  $697,849  and  $111,863,   respectively,   from
inventory held for sale to rental equipment.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - Accounts receivable are from distributors and customers of
the Company's products.  The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its
customers and maintains  allowances for potential credit losses. Also, to reduce
the risk of credit  loss,  the Company  requires  letters of credit from foreign
customers with which no credit history has been established.

Receivables are presented at the aggregate unpaid principle balance amounts, net
of an allowance for doubtful  accounts.  The allowance for doubtful  accounts is
established  through a provision for bad debts expense.  Receivables are charged
against the allowance for bad debt when management  believes the  collectibility
of an account is unlikely.  The allowance is an amount that management  believes
will be adequate to absorb future losses on existing receivables that may become
uncollectible based upon overall receivable quality,  review of specific problem
accounts,  current economic  conditions,  and prior charge-off  experience.  The
uncollectible  portion of a customer's  unpaid principle  balance is charged-off
after  the  Company   initiates  the  collection   process,   investigates   the
circumstances  of the past due  balance,  and  determines  an amount  considered
uncollectible.   Generally,   the  Company  considers  receivables  from  import
shipments  past due after 15 days;  export and air  freight  shipments  past due
after 30 days;  and shipments  utilizing a foreign agent past due after 60 days.
The  Company  accrues  interest on past due  accounts  and  continues  to accrue
interest until the Company considers the receivable uncollectable.









                                                                             F-7

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
          ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (continued)

RECEIVABLE SALES - The Company assigns some of its trade accounts  receivable to
a third party financing  source with a 12 month rolling average discount rate of
1.50% at December  31,  2002.  The  accounts  assigned  can be assigned  with or
without recourse depending on specific accounts assigned.  At December 31, 2002,
the balance of assigned accounts with recourse was $519,727.

INVENTORIES  -  Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower of cost or  market  (net
realizable value). The Company determines cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
basis. The Company's estimates of market value incorporate projections of future
sales volume by product class. In estimating the market value of parts inventory
items,  the  Company  reviews  current  inventory  levels in  relation  to sales
forecasts  and adjusts the  valuation  reserve  accordingly.  For the  remaining
categories of inventory,  the Company establishes a reserve balance based on the
aging of the specific inventory items.

PROPERTY,  PLANT,  AND  EQUIPMENT - Property,  plant and equipment are stated at
cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives which range from five to seven  years for  equipment  and twenty to thirty
years for buildings.

Expenditures for additions and major improvements are capitalized.  Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS - Intangible assets consist of licenses and patents.  The cost
of the  licenses and patents are  amortized  over the lesser of the terms of the
related agreement or the estimated useful lives of the respective asset, ranging
from three to twelve years.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is recognized when all of the following have taken
place.  The  customer  has  placed  an order for the  product,  the  product  is
delivered or shipped to the customer,  the sales price has been  determined  and
collection  is  reasonably  assured.  The Company  includes  revenues  earned on
shipping  costs  billed to customers  in Net Sales.  Costs to ship  products are
included in Cost of Sales.

WARRANTY  - At the  time of  sale,  the  Company  accrues  a  liability  for the
estimated  future  costs to be incurred  under the  provisions  of its  warranty
agreements.  The Company  reviews its  historical  warranty  expense and current
sales  trends in products  covered  under  warranty,  and  adjusts its  warranty
reserves accordingly.

The activity in that account for the years ended was as follows:

STOCK  OPTION  PLAN - The  Company  applies  Accounting  Principles  Board (APB)
Opinion  No.  25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued  to  Employees,"  and  related
interpretations   in  accounting   for  its  stock  option  plan.   Accordingly,
compensation  expense  related to grants to  employees  would be recorded on the
date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying  stock exceeded
the exercise price.  Had  compensation  cost for the Company's stock option plan
been  determined  based upon the fair  value at grant date for awards  under the
plan  consistent with the  methodology  prescribed  under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"
additional compensation expense would have been recognized.

NOTE 1       - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
                  ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (continued)

STOCK  OPTION  PLAN  (continued)  - The  Company  has  computed,  for pro  forma
disclosure  purposes,  the value of all options  granted during 2002,  2001, and
2000 using the  Black-Scholes  pricing model as  prescribed  under SFAS 123. The
following  assumptions were made for grants in 2002,  2001, and 2000:  risk-free
interest  rate of 4.41%,  4.41% and 6.10%  respectively,  expected life of seven
years,  seven years,  and three years  respectively,  and dividend rates of zero
percent.  For 2002,  2001,  and 2000 the expected  volatility  over the expected
lives of the grants was assumed to be 77.04%,  77.92%, and 75.64%  respectively.
The weighted  average fair value of the options granted was estimated to be $.20
in 2002, $.34 in 2001, and $.29 in 2000.

If the Company had accounted for the value of the options  granted  during 2002,
2001, and 2000, in accordance  with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:



                                     2002            2001            2000
                                --------------- --------------- ---------------
Net income (loss):
  As reported                     $  (663,988)    $  (164,150)    $   521,814
  Pro forma                       $  (673,278)    $  (178,023)    $   510,023

Net income (loss) per share:
  As reported                            (.06)           (.02)            .04
  Pro forma                              (.06)           (.02)            .04



The resulting pro forma  compensation  costs may not be  representative  of that
expected in future years.


INCOME  TAXES - The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  under  the asset and
liability  method.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized for the
future tax  consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial
statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their
respective  tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are measured using
enacted  tax rates  expected  to apply to  taxable  income in the years in which
those temporary  differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Valuation
allowances are  established to reduce  potential  deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that all or some portion of  potential  deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
          ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (continued)

INCOME  TAXES  (continued)  - The Company has  recorded a deferred  tax asset of
$1,013,000 and $475,000 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Although
the realization is not assured,  management  believes it is more likely than not
that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized.  The amount of the deferred
tax asset  considered to be  realizable,  however,  could be reduced in the near
future if facts surrounding the estimates of the deferred tax asset change.

ADVERTISING COSTS - The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.
Advertising  expenses for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 were
$504,060, $573,945, and $532,573, respectively.

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE - Basic net income per share is calculated using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Preferred
stock dividends were considered in the  computation.  The calculation of diluted
net income per share  excludes the effect of potentially  dilutive  common stock
equivalents  because  their impact,  when  calculated  using the treasury  stock
method, is antidilutive.

SEGMENT  INFORMATION - The Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
SFAS  No.  131,   "Disclosure  about  Segments  of  an  Enterprise  and  Related
Information,"  which establishes  annual and interim reporting  standards for an
enterprise's  operating  segments and related  disclosures  about its  products,
services,  geographic  areas and major  customers.  The Company has analyzed the
reporting  requirements  of the standard and has determined  that its operations
are within a single operating segment.

DISCLOSURE  OF FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  - The  carrying  amounts of
financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable,
and accounts payable  approximated  fair value as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
because of the  relatively  short  maturity of these  instruments.  The carrying
value of notes payable approximated fair value as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
based upon interest rates and terms available for the same or similar loans.

MANAGEMENT  ESTIMATES - The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

          ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (continued)

RECLASSIFICATIONS  -  Certain  reclassifications  have  been  made  to the  2001
financial statements to conform with the 2002 presentation.

RECENTLY  ISSUED  ACCOUNTING   STANDARDS  -  In  December  2002,  the  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB") issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standard ("SFAS") No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation--Transition
and  Disclosure--an  amendment of FASB Statement No. 123." This Statement amends
FASB Statement No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  to provide
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee  compensation.  In addition,  this
Statement  amends  the  disclosure  requirements  of  Statement  123 to  require
prominent  disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results.  The Company's  management  intends to continue
using  the  intrinsic  value  method  for  stock-based   employee   compensation
arrangements  and therefore does not expect that the  application  provisions of
this  statement  will  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's   financial
statements.

In June 2002,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,  "Accounting  for Costs  Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities." This Statement addresses financial accounting
and  reporting  for  costs  associated  with  exit or  disposal  activities  and
nullifies  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  (EITF)  Issue  No.  94-3,   "Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity  (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)."  The statement
is effective for exit or disposal  activities  that are initiated after December
31, 2002, with early application  encouraged.  The Company's management does not
expect that the  application  of the  provisions of this  statement  will have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,  "Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44, and 64,  Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical  Corrections."
This Statement  rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, "Reporting  Gains and Losses from
Extinguishment of Debt," and an amendment of that Statement,  FASB Statement No.
64,  "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy  Sinking-Fund  Requirements." This
Statement also rescinds FASB Statement No. 44.

          ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (continued)

RECENTLY ISSUED  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS  (continued)  -"Accounting for Intangible
Assets  of Motor  Carriers."  This  Statement  amends  FASB  Statement  No.  13,
"Accounting  for  Leases," to eliminate  an  inconsistency  between the required
accounting  for  sale-leaseback  transactions  and the required  accounting  for
certain  lease  modifications  that have  economic  effects  that are similar to
sale-leaseback   transactions.   This   Statement  also  amends  other  existing
authoritative  pronouncements  to make various  technical  corrections,  clarify
meanings,  or  describe  their  applicability  under  changed  conditions.   The
Company's  management  does not expect that the application of the provisions of
this  statement  will  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's   financial
statements.

In July 2001,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,  "Accounting  for Asset  Retirement
Obligations."   SFAS  No.  143  addresses  the   accounting  and  reporting  for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated  asset  retirement  costs.  SFAS No.  143 will be  effective  for the
Company in the first quarter of 2003. The Company's  management  does not expect
that the  application  of the  provisions of this statement will have a material
impact on the Company's financial statements.

In January 2003, FASB issued  Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),  "Consolidation of
Variable Interest  Entities." This  interpretation  clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,  "Consolidated  Financial  Statements," and
requires existing  unconsolidated  variable interest entities to be consolidated
by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks
among  parties  involved.  The  Company's  management  does not expect  that the
application of the provisions of this interpretation will have a material impact
on the Company's financial statements.

In November  2002,  FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 45 (FIN 45),  "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others." This  interpretation  elaborates on the
disclosures  to be made by a guarantor  in its  financial  statements  about its
obligations under certain  guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that
a  guarantor  is required to  recognize,  at the  inception  of a  guarantee,  a
liability  for  the  fair  value  of the  obligation  undertaken  in  issuing  a
guarantee.  The Company has complied with the disclosure requirements of FIN 45.
The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions shall be applied on a
prospective  basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The
Company's  management  does not expect that the application of the provisions of
this  interpretation  will have a  material  impact on the  Company's  financial
statements.

STOCK  AWARDS - The  Company has a 1991  Employee  Stock Plan (the Plan) and has
reserved 133,575 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan. Under terms
of the Plan,  stock is awarded to employees at the sole  discretion of the Board

During 1996, the Company adopted a Non-employee  Director Stock Option Plan (the

date, another 40% of the options vest and become exercisable two years after the
grant date, and the remaining portion of the options vest and become exercisable

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Ag-Bag International Limited



We have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of BAW group as of December 31,
2002,  2001 and 2000 and the related  statements  of operating  results and cash
flows, for the years then ended,  which, as described in Note 1 to the financial
statements  have been prepared on the basis of accounting  principles  generally
accepted in Germany.  These financial  statements are the  responsibility of the
company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America and in Germany.  Those standards require that we
plan and  perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial  statements.  An audit also  includes  assessing  the  accounting
principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of BAW group as of December 31,
2002,  2001 and 2000,  and the results of its  operations and its cash flows for
the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in Germany.

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
-----------------------------------------------------------

LEGAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP

The group  structure  complies with ss. 290 sub-clause 1 HGB. The parent company
of  the  group  is  BAW  Budissa  Agrodienstleistungen  und  Warenhandels  GmbH,
registered   office   at   Malschwitz.   The   subsidiaries   of   BAW   Budissa
Agrodienstleistungen  und  Warenhandels  GmbH,  AG-BAG  HUNGARIA KFT and "AG BAG
Polska" Sp.zo.o.  are affiliated  companies pursuant to ss. 271 sub-clause 2 HGB
and to ss. 290 sub-clause 2 HGB, respectively.

The company AG-BAG  HUNGARIA KFT was  incorporated  on February 11, 1999 in Gyor

6,300,000.-- , BAW Budissa Agrodienstleistungen und Warenhandels GmbH holds 90 %

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

a) Voluntary group accounts

The Company established the annual accounts of the group as of December 31, 2002
voluntarily pursuant to the shareholder resolution adopted January 29, 2002. The
limits of ss. 293 Commercial Code were not exceeded.  The annual accounts of the
group were prepared on the basis of the rules  concerning the commercial law. It
is a statement of annual  accounts  purely based on the commercial  law. Any tax
rights of choice were not exercised.

b) Cut-off Date and deferred valuation of the consolidated companies

BAW Budissa  Agrodienstleistungen und Warenhandels GmbH as the parent company of
the group as well as the  subsidiaries  AG-BAG  HUNGARIA KFT and "AG BAG Polska"
Sp.zo.o.  were included in the group accounts.  December 31, 2002 is the cut-off
date of the group  accounts.  Both the parent  company  as well as the  included
subsidiaries prepared regular annual accounts as of this cut-off date.

c) Breakdown of the group accounts and valuation principles

The  balance  sheet of the group as well as the  profit  and loss  account  were
stated and  classified  pursuant to the  provisions  of the  commercial  law for
Companies. The requirements of ss.ss. 297 ff HGB were paid due regard to.

Since the company is a joint  venture we had to come to an agreement  concerning
uniform valuation regulations in the group accounts.

Since the parent company has its registered  office and management in Germany we
agreed to use the German valuation  regulations for these group accounts without
having taken into consideration any tax privileges pursuant to German, Polish or
Hungarian tax laws.


























                                      F-40
<PAGE>
The balancing and valuation rights of choice were newly exercised, pursuant to
ss. 300 subp. 2 Commercial Code, such that they meet the accounting standards of
the United States of America, (US-GAAP).

The consequence was that for the individual accounts a trade balance II (see Tz.
26 concerning ss. 300 Commercial Law in Beck'scher Bilanzkommentar, 4th edition)
had to be established  pursuant to ss. 300 par. 2 Commercial  Law. In this trade
balance II all tax privileges were eliminated and uniform  valuation  principles
were applied.  The conversion of the  individual  accounts was made according to
the concept of the  functional  currency.  According to this concept the balance
sheet had to be  converted  on the basis of the current  rate and the profit and
loss account on the basis of the average rate.

                                Poland                Hungary

Current rate             1 PLZ = EUR 0.24840   1 HUF = EUR 0.004244
Average rate             1 PLZ = EUR 0.26631   1 HUF = EUR 0.004157

The capital  assets  were  estimated  on the basis of the initial  costs minus a
linear pro rata temporis degressive depreciation.

The stock was estimated on the basis of the  manufacturing  costs and the strict
lowest value principle.  For raw materials and supplies a fixed value was formed
pursuant  to ss.  256 HGB in  connection  with R.31  sub-clause  4 EStR  (German
Individual Income Tax Law).

The accounts  receivable  and other  assets are  estimated on the basis of their
nominal values.

The special item including reserves was shown pursuant to the recommendations of
the HFA comment  1/1984 of the  Institut  der  Wirtschaftsprufer  (Institute  of
Auditors).


























                                      F-41
<PAGE>
The reserves take into account all risks seen today. The payables were estimated
on the basis of the repayable amount.

d) Consolidation of Funds

For the consolidation of funds the book value method (ss. 301 sub-clause 1 no. 1
HGB) was, applied,  that is, the valuation of the shares in the subsidiaries was
offset  against  the   subsidiaries'   equity  falling  to  these  shares  which
corresponds  to the book  value of the assets  and debts to be  included  in the
group accounts.  The difference  amounting to EUR 4,072.28 was - not as required
by ss. 301 par. 3 Commercial Code - not activated as an enterprise value but was
written off the group  equity  since  these are only  incorporation  costs.  The
shares of the other  shareholders shown pursuant to ss. 307 Commercial Code were
taken into consideration.

e) Consolidation of Debts

According to the standard  theory the mutual  accounts  receivable  and accounts
payable  existing  between the  companies  included in the group  accounts  were
offset on the basis of ss. 303  sub-clause 1 HGB. The total amount of the mutual
accounts receivable and accounts payable that were offset is TEUR 8.1. TEUR 12.9
had to be taken out of the books as expenses.







































                                      F-42

f) Interim result elimination

We carried out an  elimination of the interim  results,  as we did last year, in
the  financial  year 2002,  see ss. 304 par.  3  Commercial  Law. A total of EUR
10,359.92  was debited to the account of the  expenditure  for raw materials and
supplies. This was necessary for the conversion of the valuation of the finished
products and goods to the group-uniform manufacturing costs.

g) Expenditure and Income Consolidation

The expenses and income resulting from the transactions of mutual  deliveries of
goods and provision of services were mutually offset by an amount of TEUR 535.4.

h) Deferred taxation

a) In the trade balance II of BAW Budissa  Agrodienstleistungen und Warenhandels
   GmbH the tax  privilege  of  voting  pursuant  to ss. 7 g Income  Tax Law was
   eliminated (ss. 300 par. 2 Commercial Code).

b) The item of potential  taxes was currently  adjusted in the year under report
   starting from 01/01/2002.

c) National differences in the tax rate were maintained.

RECONCILIATION OF GERMAN GAAP TO U.S. GAAP
------------------------------------------

The primary  difference  between the generally  accepted  accounting  principles
(GAAP) of  Germany  and the United  States is that  German  GAAP  allows for the
special reserve for a company's economic  development  plans. This reserve,  and
related tax impact,  would not be recognized under U.S. GAAP. The following is a
reconciliation  of affected  balance sheet and profits and loss accounts for the
differences between German GAAP and U.S. GAAP:
