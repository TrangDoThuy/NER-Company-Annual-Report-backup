ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
-----------------

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
-------------------

     On November 30, 2004, Ag-Bag International Limited (now known as AB Holding
Group  Inc.),  (the  "Company")  completed  the  sale of  substantially  all its
operating  assets (the "Asset Sale") to Miller St. Nazianz Inc.,  ("Miller") and
Miller  assumed  certain  liabilities  relating to the purchased  assets and the
operation of our business  arising  after the  closing.  The assets  acquired by
Miller  consisted of  substantially  all of the operating  assets of the Company
including: Inventory; Equipment; and Intangible assets.

Some of the Company's  assets were excluded from the Asset Sale.  Because Miller
is an existing  company with its own  manufacturing  facilities,  Miller did not
need to purchase the Company's real estate,  paint booths and systems, or Visual
computer system. The excluded assets consisted of:

     o   cash;

     o   accounts receivable;

     o   real estate;

     o   paint booths and systems;

     o   Visual computer system;

     o   corporate  minute and stock record books and  corporate  seal,  general
         accounting  records  and  books of  original  entries,  checkbooks  and
         cancelled checks,  and tax returns,  reports and related records of the
         Company ("CORPORATE RECORDS"); and

     o   rights and interest in and to any contracts  not assumed by Miller,  if
         any; and

     o   a plastics supply agreement with UpNorth ("UpNorth").

The Asset Sale resulted in the elimination of the Company's historical farm feed
management and composting system operations with a corresponding  elimination of
substantially all of the Company's  operating revenue and related expenses.  The
Company's only operations  currently  consist of converting its remaining assets
into cash and corporate  administrative expenses of winding down and remaining a
non-operating  public shell, until the Company can either dissolve and liquidate
or sell the remaining  non-operating  public shell to another party

by merger or another method.  Therefore,  except as otherwise  specifically  set
forth in this report,  the results of operations of the historical  business set
forth in this  report,  do not reflect the effects on the  Company's  operations
which resulted from the closing of the Asset Sale.

The taxable gain generated as a result of the Asset Sale,  will be offset by the
utilization of net operating loss carry forwards.

GENERAL
-------

     AB Holding Group, Inc., formerly known as Ag-Bag International Limited (the
"Company")  was  incorporated  as a New York  corporation  in 1989.  The primary
operating company, Ag-Bag Corporation, a Nebraska corporation,  was incorporated
in 1978.  The Company  changed its name in 1990 from AB Holding  Group,  Inc. to
Ag-Bag  International  Limited.  In 1994,  in an effort to  streamline  and save
administrative  expenses,  two of the  Company's  operating  subsidiaries,  A.B.
Rental,  Inc. and Ag-Bag  Corporation were merged into the Delaware  subsidiary,
ABVIN Merging Corp. On January 1, 1995, the Company was merged into its Delaware
subsidiary  resulting  in the  reincorporation  of the Company in Delaware and a
change in its name to Ag-Bag  International  Limited.  On December  7, 2004,  in
connection  with the Asset Sale, the Company changed its name back to AB Holding
Group, Inc.

     Prior to the  closing of the Asset  Sale,  the  Company  had  pioneered  an
alternate method of storing feed for livestock.  Traditional  methods of storing
feed included placing it in bunkers,  pits, and silos or baling and stacking it.
The  Company's  method was to store the feed in huge  plastic  bags of up to 500
feet in length and up to 14 feet in diameter by tightly  stuffing  the feed into
the bag. The Company assembled the machines for stuffing the feed into the bags.
It had  the  bags  manufactured  to  its  specifications  and  then  folded  and
distributed  the bags through its dealer network and directly in an area where a
dealer was not present.  The benefits of bagging the feed included reduced cost,
additional  flexibility  in  harvesting  and  storing  the feed,  enhanced  feed
quality,  and  relatively  small  capital  requirements.  The Company  also sold
ancillary products that complemented the Company's main line of bagging machines
and bags.

     The  following  table  identified  the revenue  from each product line that
accounted for more than 15% of total revenue over the last three years:

     Machines                    44%              40%             34%
     Parts                        5%              6%              21%
     Other                        3%              5%               5%
                              -----------      ----------      -----------
     Net Sales                   100%            100%             100%


     The  Company  expected  the use of bagging as a means of silage  storage to
continue  to play a major role in the future  because the quality of stored feed
was better than other known  competitive  methods,  allowing  farmers to be more
efficient and to produce dairy,  beef, sheep and pork products at a lower price.
The Company  believed the concept of bagging was one way in which  farmers could
be more profitable by reducing, or completely eliminating,  the purchase of feed
and grain from outside sources.  Bagging enables the farmer to produce and store
the feed on the farm and provides easier access to the silage,  thereby allowing
the farmer to choose the quality of silage to feed at any given time. The bagged
feed has shown high quality, allowing for higher production.

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  in 2004,  the Company  shipped its
first orders to Russia.  The Company continued to sell worldwide in Asia, Japan,
Latin America,  Australia,  New Zealand, and Western and Central Europe.  Export
sales from the Company's  United States  operations were 10.81% of net sales for
the year ended December 31, 2004.

     In 1997,  the Company  formed a German  joint  venture in which the Company
owned a 50% interest and its former German  dealer owned the remaining  50%. The
joint venture  folded and  distributed  silage bags to the Company's  German and
European  dealers.  On April 27, 2004,  the Company sold its  investment in this
joint venture to its former German  dealer,  to provide the Company with working
capital.

     The Company was developing  other uses for its bagging  technology prior to
the  closing of the Asset Sale to  Miller.  In 1993,  the  Company  adapted  its
bagging  machines  to  permit  bagging  of  compostable  organic  matter  in the
Company's recyclable Tri-Dura(R) plastic bags. The Company also developed mobile
and stationary plastic recovery units which enabled the Company to bail and pick
up the recyclable Tri-Dura(R) plastic bags as a service to its customers.

SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS
---------------------------

     Prior to the  closing of the Asset Sale,  the core  business of the Company
was  historically  seasonal  due to the  harvest  seasons in North  America  and
Europe.  The Company's  machinery  tended to be purchased in anticipation of the
next harvest  season,  so most of the sales of machinery  occurred in the spring
and summer.  This required the Company to carry significant amounts of inventory
to meet rapid delivery  requirements of customers.  Bag sales tended to occur as
the harvest  season  approached in the summer,  and during the harvest season in
the  fall.  The  Company  previously  took  steps  to  counteract  some  of  its
seasonality  by  generating  sales in  Latin  America  beginning  in 1994 and in
Australia  and New  Zealand  in  1996.  In  September  2002,  the  Company  took
additional  steps to counteract  seasonality by developing and  introducing  its
pre-season  ordering  program,  whereby the Company's  dealers placed their next
year's  annual  product  requirements  order in advance and  utilized one of the
Company's third party  financing  sources.  This pre-season  program allowed the
Company to know in advance its production mix which in turn provided the Company
with the ability to level its production and flexibility in customer  shipments.
During 2003,  the Company  expanded this program by allowing  dealers to finance
through  their local  bank,  rather  than  requiring  them to utilize one of the
Company's third-party financing programs. This however, brought seasonality back
into play for the Company,  as  shipments  under the dealer bank program were at
the timing of the dealer rather than the Company.  The pre-season  order program
was a program under which the Company paid the flooring interest for its dealers
and paid  volume  discounts  to its dealers  based upon a sliding  scale for the
volume of orders  placed by and shipped to, the dealer  under the  program.  The
Company  terminated the  pre-season  order program upon the closing of the Asset
Sale.

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  approximately 95% of the Company's
business was concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere resulting in between 53-69%
of the Company's  revenue being generated  during the spring and summer (2nd and
3rd fiscal  quarters).  The following  table  outlines the percentage of revenue
over the past three years by quarter:

FARM EQUIPMENT AND PRODUCTS
---------------------------

     INTRODUCTION. Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, silage was made using
the Ag-Bag(R) system by storing forage crops, such as corn, sorghum, or alfalfa,
under anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions in sealed Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) storage
bags. The traditional  methods for making silage involved storing it in bunkers,
pits or silos.  Using traditional  methods,  there was a nutrient loss resulting
from a reduction  in the  moisture  content of the forage  before  storage.  The
moisture  content needed to be reduced to compensate for the high oxygen content
of the forage,  which  resulted  from the  inability to pack the forage  tightly
enough.  When the forage was not packed  sufficiently,  the silage  fermentation
process  produced  too much heat  resulting  in an even greater loss of nutrient
value than would  normally  occur if the moisture  content was not reduced.  The
loss of nutrient value resulted in the need for additional  food  supplements or
an increased volume of feed.

     The Ag-Bag(R)  system was an  alternative to bunkers,  pits and silos.  The
Ag-Bag(R)  bagging machines pushed the forage into huge recyclable  plastic film
Tri-Dura(R) bags with sufficient  compaction to minimize the amount of oxygen in
the bag,  which was then sealed  tightly  when filled.  As a result,  the forage
could be stored with significantly higher moisture content. The ability to store
the forage in this manner also  reduced  the time  required to cut,  prepare and
store the forage thus reducing the loss of nutrients and provided higher quality
feed for production  within the farmers'  herds.  As a result of the Asset Sale,
Miller  now  manufactures,  operates,  and  sells  the  Ag-Bag(R)  line  of farm
equipment, bags and composting systems.

     AG-BAG(R)  FARM  EQUIPMENT.  Prior to the  closing of the Asset  Sale,  the
Company's  principal  line of farm  equipment was marketed  under the trade name
"Ag-Bagger(R)",  which is now owned by Miller. The Ag-Bagger(R) was available in
three  versions  with a number of  optional  features.  Wide  ranges of optional
features  were  offered by the Company on its bagging  machines in order to meet
the budget needs of the farmer.

     The smallest version  consisted of machines used to load forage into Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags ranging in size from 8 to 10 feet in diameter and 100
to 250 feet in  length.  The  Company  first  introduced  this  version in 1987.
Dairymen used it primarily in smaller dairy and cattle feeding  operations  with
herds averaging  about 50 head and by cattlemen  feeding up to about 300 head of
feeder cattle. Most of these machines were powered by the power take-off unit of
a farm tractor and moved by a tractor or other farm vehicle.  In late 2002,  the
Company  introduced a basic model of its smaller bagging machine,  the "Personal
Bagger".  The retail price for these machines ranged from approximately  $19,900
to $53,000.

     In 1992, the Company introduced a medium-sized machine that was operated by
the power  take-off  unit of a farm  tractor or could be operated  independently
with an optional diesel engine. This machine allowed farmers to load forage into
Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags ranging in size from 9 to 10 feet in diameter
and 100 to 250 feet in length.  This machine was primarily used by dairymen with
herds ranging from 150 to 300 head and by cattlemen  feeding between 300 and 800
head  of  feeder  cattle.   The  retail  price  for  this  machine  ranged  from
approximately $80,000 to $228,500.

<PRE>
     The largest version consisted of machines that could be used to load Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags ranging in size from 9 to 14 feet in diameter and 150
to 500 feet in length. These machines were primarily used by dairymen with herds
ranging  from 300 to 2,000 head,  by  cattlemen  with herds  ranging from 800 to
15,000 head, and by custom operators. A super 12-foot Ag-Bagger(R) was developed
in 1989 and  enhanced  in 1995.  In 2002,  the  Company  introduced  its 14-foot
version of the Ag-Bagger(R) for use by very large dairy and custom operators and
by cattle  feeding  operations  with herds ranging from 15,000 to 25,000 head of
cattle.  The larger machines were available with optional  diesel  engines.  The
retail  price for the larger  machines  ranged  from  approximately  $155,000 to
$325,000.

     In response to a competitor's introduction of a cable-less machine in early
1995, the Company began research and  development on its own cable-less  machine
in early 1996.  The Company began  production of its own  cable-less  machine in
1997. In 1998, the Company  introduced its own cable-less bagging machine called
the HFC (Hydraulic Finger  Controlled)  Silage Bagger.  The introduction of this
machine was in response to what the Company  felt was a change in  direction  of
the industry  towards the  cable-less  machine  design and the latest in bagging
technology. In 1999, the Company continued to develop and improve its cable-less
bagging  machine and developed the Powered Anchor  Control (PAC) system,  and in
2000  introduced  the latest  version of the  cable-less  bagging  machine,  the
HYPAC(R)  (Hydraulic  Powered Anchor  Control)  system.  The Company offered the
HYPAC(R) model in small,  medium-sized  and large-sized  bagging  machines.  The
retail  price for the HYPAC(R)  machines  ranged from  approximately  $53,000 to
$325,000.

     The Company  assembled and sold a separate line of related equipment called
the Ag-Bag  Flex-a-Tuber(R)  with a retail  price that  ranged  from  $11,500 to
$18,000.  The  Flex-a-Tuber(R)  permitted farmers to store round-baled  alfalfa,
sorghum,  and other forage in Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags.  The round bale
Flex-a-Tubers(R)  were made in two sizes to permit  the  bagging of 4 and 5 foot
bales.  The bales could be stored in Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags up to 200
feet in length. In 2002, the Company began  manufacturing this line of equipment
on a made-to-order basis.

     The Company  assembled and sold a separate line of related equipment called
the Square Bale Bagger, which retailed for approximately $23,500 to $31,000. The
Square Bale Bagger permitted  farmers to store square bales of alfalfa,  sorghum
and other forage;  two bales high in Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  flex storage bags. The
Square Bale Bagger permitted the bagging of the bales in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) flex
storage bags of 7 to 10 feet in diameter and up to 200 feet in length. Beginning
in  2002,  the  Company  began   manufacturing  this  line  of  equipment  on  a
made-to-order basis.

     The  Company  assembled  and sold the  Ag-Bag(R)  Pro-Grain  Bagger,  which
retailed for  approximately  $33,500.  This machine was similar in design to the
smallest  Ag-Bagger(R)  machines  but had been  adapted to permit the storage of
grains,  such as corn, rice, wheat and soybeans,  as well as other products,  in
Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags. The machine  permitted the grain to be bagged
without damaging the kernel.  After the grain was bagged and sealed, it retained
the necessary quality for human consumption.

     The Company  also  assembled  and sold the Mighty  Bite(R)  front-end  load
bucket.   This   revolutionary   bucket   replaced  the   conventional   bucket.
Hydraulically  operated, the Mighty Bite(R) closed tightly around material, thus
eliminating spillage and increasing load capacity due to compaction. The Company
manufactured the Mighty Bite(R) in sizes ranging from one-half cubic yard to two
cubic yards with a retail price that ranged from $3,300 to $4,900.

     The Company adapted its Ag-Bag(R)  bagging  machines for use in large-scale
"in-vessel"  composting  of organic  matter.  The  bagging  machine  was used in
conjunction with a shredder that shredded the organic  material,  which was then
fed into the  bagging  machine  that bagged the  compostable  matter into Ag-Bag

<PRE>
Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags. An air blower was attached to the bag and  circulated
air through the bag during the composting process. The Ag-Bag(R) compost bagging
machines retailed for between $52,500 to $137,000.

     AG-BAG  TRI-DURA(R)  STORAGE BAGS.  Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,
the Company  folded and sold Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  disposable  storage  bags that
ranged in size from 8 to 14 feet in diameter  and 100 to 500 feet in length that
were  made of  extruded  plastic.  Rolls of  plastic  were  manufactured  to the
Company's  specifications.  The  plastic  contained  special  stabilizers  which
protected the bags from  deterioration  due to exposure to weather and the sun's
ultraviolet  rays.  Once a  Tri-Dura(R)  bag was used,  it had to be recycled or
disposed of in another manner, but could not be reused.

     The  Company  contracted  for the  manufacture  of,  and  sold  Tri-Dura(R)
three-ply bags with a white exterior and black interior  intended for storage of
silage up to 24 months.  The retail price of the bags ranged from  approximately
$136 to $2,150.  The  manufactured  plastic  rolls were shipped to the Company's
plant in Blair,  Nebraska,  where  they were  folded  and  packed for sale using
proprietary folding  techniques.  The proprietary bag folding techniques reduced
bag folding  time and allowed the bags to uniformly  unfold while being  filled,
thereby reducing  operational  delays. As a result of the Asset Sale, Miller now
owns the bag folding equipment and sells the Tri-Dura(R) bags.

     AG-BAG(R)  INOCULANT.  Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  the Company
marketed a liquid and dry powder inoculant under the trade name Ag-Bag Plus!(R).
The  inoculant  was added to the  forage or the  round or  square  bales  during
bagging.  It  enhanced  the  fermentation  process  for  making  silage in bags,
bunkers,  pits and silos by substantially  shortening the time necessary for the
creation of the silage.  A liquid  inoculant  was  developed in 1989 by a former
Company  supplier and introduced  into the market in 1990. The dry inoculant was
produced from a proprietary  formula owned by the Company and developed by Larry
R. Inman and former  executive  Walter L. Jay.  See  "Executive  Officers of the
Registrant."  The Company also marketed an inoculant  designed  specifically for
composting.  As a result  of the Asset  Sale,  Miller  now  sells the  Ag-Bag(R)
inoculants and owns the proprietary formula.

MARKET SIZE
-----------

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, the market for Ag-Bag(R)  machinery
and Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  recyclable  storage bags was primarily in the dairy and
beef  cattle  industries.  Silage was used most  often as dairy and beef  animal
feed. It was also used by farmers to a lesser extent, to feed hogs and sheep. In
2002,  over 250 million tons of corn,  alfalfa,  sorghum,  silage,  and hay were
harvested by United States farmers  according to the AG IQ Handbook XX published
in 2003 by  Agricom,  Inc.  (the "AG  Handbook").  Based on 2000  United  States
Department of Agriculture  (USDA)  statistics,  the Company estimated that there
were  approximately  105,000 dairies,  and 150,000 beef, hog, and sheep farms in
the United States that were potential customers for Ag-Bag(R) farm equipment and
Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags; and that only about 8-12% of this group actually used
storage bags made by the Company or its competitors. Prior to the closing of the
Asset Sale,  the Company  estimated  that about  45-50% of the bagging  industry
customers  purchased  silage  storage bags from the Company.  In addition to the
U.S., the Company believed there was a large population of such farms in Canada,
Latin America,  Western and Central Europe,  Australia,  New Zealand,  and Asia,
where the Company sold and distributed its products,  and that there was a large
potential market in other countries where the Company may have expanded.

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  the Company also marketed a system
for  "in-vessel"  composting  which was designed to eliminate  odors and control
leachate  inherent with composting.  Composting was an alternative for disposing
of or  eliminating  the large number of organics from  landfills.  The Company's
primary focus was directed towards municipalities,  private composters, military
bases,  zoos and the  Company's  former  dairy and beef  customers.  The Company
estimated  the size of the compost  market  within  North  America to be over $2
billion a year. Until further marketing efforts were made outside North America,
the Company  could

<PRE>
not estimate with any certainty the foreign  market size.  However,  the Company
believed that there was a large  potential  market in other countries into which
it may  have  expanded.  No  assurance  could  be  given  that  the  "in-vessel"
composting   system  would  be  accepted  in  either  the  domestic  or  foreign
marketplace.

MARKETING
---------

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company  marketed its Ag-Bag(R)
farm equipment,  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags, Ag-Bag Plus!(R) and other inoculants
primarily  through  a network  of United  States,  Canadian,  and  international
dealers;  that  were  serviced  by  Company-employed  regional  and  territorial
managers  and sales  support  coordinators.  With the closing of the Asset Sale,
these  employee  positions  were  eliminated.  Most of the dealers  marketed the
entire Ag-Bag(R) line of farm equipment and products; however, some dealers sold
only the farm  equipment  and others  sold only the  Ag-Bag(R)  inoculants.  The
Company  also sold farm  equipment,  Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags,  and  inoculant
directly  to large  customers  in states  where  there were no nearby  Ag-Bag(R)
dealers.  Beginning in 2002,  the Company began  focusing its marketing  efforts
more on dealer development and expanding its dealer network rather than focusing
towards direct selling. In September 2002, the Company introduced its pre-season
ordering  program for its products,  whereby the Company's  dealers placed their
next year's annual product  requirements  order in advance.  As a result of this
program's  success,  the Company  continued the pre-season order program for the
2003-04 season with minor modifications.  The Company's pre-season order program
ceased with the closing of the Asset Sale.

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company  offered  customers the
opportunity  to  finance  the  purchase  of  Ag-Bag(R)  farm  equipment  through
unaffiliated third parties who offered  lease-purchase and wholesale  financing.
Additionally,  the Company rented used Ag-Bag(R)  bagging machines to farmers in
various  areas of the United  States and charged a rental based on the number of
bags purchased and filled with forage.

     Prior to December 31, 1997, the Company  offered a custom  bagging  service
through its subsidiary Ag-Bag Europe PLC in the United Kingdom. The Company sold
its subsidiary that had not been performing at a profitable level due to the BSE
(Mad Cow) problem within the British farming industry on December 31, 1997.

     In late 2003, BSE (Mad Cow) was discovered in the United States. Based upon
the quick  response of the USDA and their findings at the time, the Company felt
that BSE (Mad Cow) would have little  impact on its  operations  as its customer
base was largely focused on dairy farming rather than the beef industry.

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company marketed its composting
system  through a  sublicense  that  allowed  the end user to use the  Ag-Bag(R)
compost technology. The Company planned to establish a composting dealer network
and develop a regional and territorial  sales force that would have expertise in
composting in the future. As a result of the Asset Sale, Miller now owns all the
rights to the compost technology.

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  the Company was not  dependent  on
any single customer or a few customers.  The loss of any single customer did not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's  financial  condition or results
of operations.


WEBSITE
-------

AB Holding  Group Inc., no longer  maintains a website.  Prior to the closing of
the Asset Sale,  the Company  maintained a website for use by its customers that
contained information about the Company, its products, and educational materials
regarding their use. The website address for Ag-Bag was http://www.ag-bag.com.

ASSEMBLY AND MANUFACTURING
--------------------------

     AG-BAG(R)  FARM  EQUIPMENT.  Prior to the  closing of the Asset  Sale,  the
Company  bought some of its  components  for its bagging  machines  from various
manufacturers, manufactured the remaining components, and assembled the machines
itself.  The medium and large  sized  machines,  composting  machines,  HYPAC(R)
(cable-less)  machines,  Square  Bale  Baggers,  and  Flex-a-Tubers(R)  were all
assembled at the  Company's  headquarters  facility in  Warrenton,  Oregon.  The
smaller machines were assembled at the Company's Blair, Nebraska plant. In 1999,
the Company  licensed its former German dealer to manufacture  bagging  machines
for distribution  within Europe.  This license was transferred to Miller as part
of the Asset Sale.

     The Company  assembled  all of its machines in order to better  control the
quality of the farm  equipment.  This method also permitted the Company to offer
customized assembly for the end user of its equipment. The Company could acquire
and install name brand manufactured components specified by the customer in lieu
of those ordinarily installed by the Company.

     AG-BAG  TRI-DURA(R)  STORAGE BAGS.  Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,
all of the three-ply  Tri-Dura(R) storage bags were manufactured for the Company
by  a  single  manufacturer.   The  bags  were  manufactured  to  the  Company's
specifications  using a stabilizer  that  protected  the plastic  from  becoming
brittle due to exposure to weather  and the sun's  ultraviolet  light rays.  The
Tri-Dura(R)  plastic  bags were made in  various  diameters  based on bag orders
received by the  Company.  The bags were  shipped in roll form to the  Company's
plant in Blair, Nebraska, where they were folded and packaged for shipment.

     AG-BAG(R)  INOCULANTS.  Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company
purchased  on the open  market the liquid and  compost  inoculant.  The  Company
believed that the liquid and compost inoculant would be reasonably available for
purchase on the open market for the  foreseeable  future.  The dry inoculant was
produced by the Company at the Blair, Nebraska,  plant pursuant to a proprietary
formula  owned  by the  Company  and  developed  by Larry R.  Inman  and  former
executive  Walter L. Jay. The proprietary  formula was sold as part of the Asset
Sale. See "Executive Officers of the Registrant."

PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS
-------------------------------------

     Prior  to  the  closing  of the  Asset  Sale,  the  Company  purchased  its
Tri-Dura(R)  rolls from a company (the "Supplier")  partially owned by Steven G.
Ross pursuant to a supply agreement (the "Supply Agreement").  Steven G. Ross is
a 15.03%  stockholder  in the Company and President of a company which  competed
with the Company's  Tri-Dura(R)  bags.  The Supply  Agreement  provided that the
Company  purchase  all of its  plastic  rolls,  with  certain  exceptions,  from
Supplier through at least December 31, 2007.  Thereafter,  either the Company or
Supplier  could  terminate  the Supply  Agreement  upon two years' prior written
notice.  The Company could  purchase  plastic rolls from other  suppliers to the
extent  Supplier was unable to supply plastic rolls under the Supply  Agreement.
Since the Company's Asset Sale, the Company no longer has any  requirements  for
plastic  rolls under this Supply  Agreement.  On February 9, 2005, in settlement
with  supplier,  the  Supply  Agreement  was  terminated.  (See "Item 3. - Legal
Proceedings")

     Prior to the closing of the Asset  Sale,  several  manufacturing  companies
manufactured  the  structural  components of the Company's  farm and  composting
equipment in Oregon,  Nebraska and Iowa. The Company  believed that  alternative
sources of supply were readily available at competitive  prices in the event the
Company's sources of supply became unavailable.

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company mixed the dry inoculant
at its Blair,  Nebraska  facility.  It  purchased  the  ingredients  for the dry
inoculant  from a variety of  suppliers.  The Company  purchased  the liquid and
compost  inoculant  from a supplier,  who mixed the  inoculants to the Company's
specifications.  The

Company  believed  there  were  various  other  alternative  sources  of  supply
available in the event that it became necessary to purchase inoculant from other
suppliers.

COMPETITION
-----------

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, as the Company's  former  corporate
slogan, the "Complete 1(R)," indicated, the Company believed it was the industry
leader in the manufacture and sale of complete sealed feed farm bagging systems.
Ag-Bag  International  Limited was the only company that  manufactured  the full
line of equipment,  bags, and other accessories for sealed feed farm management.
There were three competitors within the United States that manufactured  similar
silage  bagging  machines.   There  were  also  a  number  of  competitors  that
manufactured  bale  wrapping   machines,   which  competed  with  the  Company's
Flex-a-Tuber(R). The Company distinguished itself in the market place from other
manufacturers  by providing a top quality product,  better warranty  protection,
and customer service.

     The bag market was highly  competitive.  The  Company  competed  in the bag
market by  providing  what the  Company  believed  to be a superior  product and
better  warranty  protection at a competitive  price.  The Company also offered,
through central pickup and fixed locations in selected  geographic  areas of the
U.S., a recycling service for used Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) bags.

     The Company also competed with companies constructing bunkers and pits and,
to a lesser extent,  silos. These competitors were mostly smaller companies that
built the bunkers and pits for the farmer,  which the farmer  filled with forage
using  available  or  rented  farm  equipment  otherwise  used  in  the  farming
operation. While these methods did not require bags or special equipment to fill
the  bags,  the  use of  these  alternatives  involved  a  significant  loss  of
flexibility  in storing  and  harvesting  the feed and an  overall  loss of feed
quality.  Flexibility was lost since structures had to be permanently placed and
significant capital requirements were necessary to expand them. The feed quality
was  inferior  because  of the amount of oxygen  remaining  after the forage was
placed in the pits or bunkers.

     The  Company  competed  primarily  with  windrow  turner  manufacturers  in
composting.  Windrow  turners  composted  by turning and  watering  static piles
weekly  and  required  containment  of odor and  leachate.  These  turners  were
comparable in price to the Company's  compost machines.  However,  the Company's
composting systems offered the advantage of being self-contained,  thus reducing
odor  and  requiring  no  turning  or  watering.  There  were  approximately  50
manufacturers of turners. In addition to the windrow turner  manufacturers,  the
Company competed with several companies that manufactured  "in-vessel"  systems,
such as burners and incinerators  for large projects,  which generally cost from
$1.5 to $15 million.

     The  Company  competed  in its product  markets  primarily  on the basis of
product  quality,  warranty  protection,  and  customer  service.  Some  of  its
competitors were larger and had greater  financial,  marketing,  technical,  and
other resources than the Company.


BACKLOG
-------

     As a result of the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company no longer has any
operations, and therefore no longer has any backlog of orders.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
------------------------

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  during 2004,  the Company  focused
research and  development  expenditures  on ongoing testing newer designs of its
larger-sized  silage-bagging  machine,  in addition to further  compost  machine
modification and recycling  development.  The Company also completed research on
various  projects  undertaken  regarding new silage and  nutritional  studies of
bagged feed and their effects on animal  production during the year. The Company
also continued with ongoing research and testing in this area as well.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
---------------------

     Compliance with federal,  state and local laws and  regulations  regulating
the discharge of materials into the  environment,  or otherwise  relating to the
protection of the environment, had no material effect upon capital expenditures,
earnings, or competitive positions of the Company during the year ended December
31, 2004.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
----------------------

     Prior  to the  closing  of the  Asset  Sale,  the  Company  had  basic  and
improvement  patents in the U.S., as well as a number of patents  pending,  that
encompassed  machines,  bags and systems for silage bagging,  grain bagging, and
hay/straw  bale  bagging.  Corresponding  applications  were  filed in  selected
foreign countries. In addition, proprietary rights in the bagging of compost had
been and were being  developed  in the U.S and in  selected  foreign  countries.
Miller  acquired  the rights and  ownership  of all our patents and  trademarks,
including those in process, in the Asset Sale.

     The Company's  patents on its basic bagging  machine were found to be valid
and were successfully defended in prior litigation. The Company believed that it
developed  its  position in the  industry  partially  as a result of  protection
provided by these patents.  The Company also owned the  proprietary  formula for
making the dry inoculant  marketed under the trade name Ag-Bag  Plus!(R),  which
was  developed  by Larry R.  Inman and  former  executive  Walter  L.  Jay.  The
proprietary formula was sold as part of the Asset Sale. (See "Executive Officers
of the Registrant")

     The  names  Ag-Bag(R),  Ag-Bag  Plus!(R),   Bale-Bag(R),   Flex-a-Tuber(R),
Flex-a-Tube(R),  ABCTI System(R),  Mighty Bite(R),  Tri-Dura(R),  and the symbol
"AB"(R) are all  registered  as  trademarks  with the United  States  Patent and
Trademark Office, and were sold as part of the Asset Sale.

     The Company  believed that its color scheme and trademarks  were well known
in the industry,  were an important part of its business, and gave the Company a
competitive advantage.

EMPLOYEES
---------

     On December 31, 2004,  the Company had 5 full-time  employees.  The Company
employed  approximately 84 people during its busy season in fiscal 2004 prior to
the Asset Sale. None of the Company's  employees are represented by a union, and
the Company believes that its employee relations are good.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
-------------------

     In early 1990, the Company began  occupying its 30,000 square foot facility
located  in   Warrenton,   Oregon  (the  "Oregon   Facility").   The   Company's
administrative offices are located there. The Company occupies the land pursuant
to a lease that expires in 2014.  The Company still owns the  Warrenton,  Oregon
real estate, as this was not sold as part of the Asset Sale. The Oregon Facility
is  currently  held  for  sale and the  Company  hopes to find a buyer  for this
facility in the near term.  Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  this Oregon
Facility  served as a  warehouse  and housed a major  portion  of the  Company's
silage bagging equipment manufacturing.

     The Company owns a facility in Blair,  Nebraska (the "Nebraska  Facility").
The  Nebraska  Facility  consists of three  buildings  comprising  approximately
70,000 square feet. The Company still owns the Blair,  Nebraska real estate,  as
this was an excluded  asset not sold as part of the Asset Sale.  The facility is
currently  held for sale and the Company hopes to find a buyer for this facility
in the near term Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  the Company folded and
packaged  their  Tri-Dura(R)  feed storage  bags;  prepared  and packaged  their
proprietary  inoculant;  and,  assembled  their  smaller  bagging  machines  and
warehoused product at the Nebraska Facility.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
--------------------------

     The Company was a defendant in alleged patent infringement lawsuits,  Versa
Corporation v. Ag-Bag  International  Ltd., filed October 30, 2000 and March 19,
2003 in the United States  District Court for the District of Oregon.  The claim
alleged patent infringement upon Versa's U.S. Patent Nos. 5,799,472;  5,894,713;
5,345,744;  5,426,910;  RE38020 and  5,452,562  relating  to a bag pan,  density
control  and  adjustable  anchor wing patent for an  agricultural  feed  bagging
machine and composting  method patents.  Plaintiff sought monetary  damages.  On
February 6, 2004,  the bag pan,  density  control and  composting  method patent
claims were settled and dismissed in their  entirety.  On January 28, 2004,  the
court ruled,  in the remaining  adjustable  anchor wing patent  claim,  that the
Company did not infringe upon Versa's  RE38020  patent.  The Company  previously
filed for summary  judgment for  non-infringement  of Versa's patent and filed a
motion for summary judgment for Versa's patent invalidity of the RE38020 patent.
On December  15,  2004,  the anchor wing patent  matter was settled and the case
dismissed in its entirety, thereby concluding the final Versa litigation matter.
On December 14, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
ruled on Versa's appeal (collectively called the "544 Litigation"), and reversed
the District Courts decision that Ag-Bag did not infringe

relative to the use of flutes in the `910 composting method patent.  Pursuant to
the settlement reached February 6, 2004 between the parties, as a result of this
reversal, the Company is required to pay a royalty on compost bags sold from the
date of the appeal  decision  forward,  over the life of the `744  patent.  As a
result of the Asset Sale, since Miller is the owner of all of the Ag-Bag patents
and trademarks, these future royalty payments will be borne by Miller. All Versa
litigation is now dismissed and concluded.

     The  Company  was a defendant  in an alleged  breach of  contract  lawsuit,
UpNorth  Plastics,   Inc.,  v.  Ag-Bag  International  Ltd.,  Civil  Action  No.
3:04-CV-1946-L  filed  September 8, 2004 in the United  States  District  Court,
Northern  District of Texas,  Dallas  Division.  The claim alleged breach of the
"no-shop"  provision of the letter of intent dated February 27, 2004 between the
parties.  The Company  denied the  allegations  and vigorously  defended  itself
against the lawsuit.  On October 12, 2004, the Company filed a motion to dismiss
the  complaint  for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,
and on November 22, 2004 filed an additional  motion to stay discovery pending a
ruling on the motion to dismiss.  Additionally, on December 9, 2004, the Company
filed a motion for  protective  order  pending  rulings  on the  motions to stay
discovery  and  dismiss.  Prior  to the  court's  ruling  on any of the  pending
motions,  the parties  reached a settlement  agreement  dated  February 9, 2005.
Pursuant to the parties'  settlement,  the court entered an order dismissing the
case with prejudice on February 17, 2005.  UpNorth  Plastics  Inc.'s  President,
Steven G. Ross, is a 15.03% shareholder of the Company.

     The Company  was a defendant  in an  arbitration  proceeding  in an alleged
breach of contract proceeding,  UpNorth Plastics,  Inc., v. Ag-Bag International
Limited,  American Arbitration  Association,  Case No.  65-181-Y-00441-04  filed
November 29, 2004 before the American Arbitration  Association,  in the State of
Minnesota. The claim alleged breach of the supply agreement between the parties.
The Company denied the allegations  and vigorously  defended itself against this
arbitration  proceeding.  Prior  to  the  arbitration,  the  parties  reached  a
settlement agreement dated February 9, 2005, thereby dismissing this arbitration
proceeding in its entirety. UpNorth Plastics Inc.'s, President,  Steven G. Ross,
is a 15.03% shareholder of the Company.

     Additionally,  on November  29,  2004,  UpNorth  Plastics,  Inc.,  filed an
application  for a  Temporary  Restraining  Order and  Temporary  and  Permanent
Injunctions,  UpNorth Plastics,  Inc., v. Ag-Bag  International  Limited, in the
Washington County District Court, 10th District, State of Minnesota,  seeking to
block the Asset Sale to Miller,  preventing  the  Company  from  distributing  a
portion of the sales  proceeds from the then pending Asset Sale,  and compelling
the Company to continue to perform its  obligations  under the supply  agreement
with UpNorth.  On November 29, 2004,  the court ruled upon and denied  UpNorth's
motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Temporary and Permanent Injunctions
against the Company  which  concluded  this  matter.  UpNorth  Plastics  Inc.'s,
President, Steven G. Ross, is a 15.03% shareholder of the Company.

     The  Company is a  defendant  in an alleged  lawsuit,  Case  Credit Ltd, v.
Artomda  Farms Ltd,  Tom's  Custom  Services  Ltd.;  Thomas  Stoker,  and Ag-Bag
International  Ltd,  filed  September  24, 2003 in the Court of Queen's Bench of
Alberta Judicial District of Calgary. The claim alleges improper assignment of a
third party financing Company retail installment  contract for a bagging machine
sold by the Company to Thomas Stoker. Mr. Stoker subsequently defaulted with the
third  party  finance   Company,   and  the  bagging  machine  was  subsequently
repossessed by Case Credit Ltd., and, sold for a greatly reduced value,  without
first  allowing the Company to  repurchase  said bagging  machine per its Dealer
agreement  with the  third  party  finance  Company.  Plaintiff  seeks  monetary
damages.  The Company  denies all  allegations  of this claim and is  vigorously
defending  itself  against this claim.  Depositions  continue  and  discovery is
ongoing in this matter.  The  Company's  defense  costs in this matter are being
handled through its insurer.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Company's  Common Stock began trading publicly on January 17, 1990, and
was approved for quotation on Nasdaq on April 24, 1990, under the symbol "AGBG."
In 1997,  the Nasdaq  listing  requirements  were  substantially  expanded.  The
Company does not currently qualify under the more stringent requirements because
the  price at which  its  Common  Stock is  trading  is below  the $1 per  share
minimum.  The Company was formally  notified on January 13, 1999 that its Common
Stock was delisted from quotation on The Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market for failure to
meet the new listing  requirements.  The Company's Common Stock is now quoted on
the OTC Bulletin Board. Effective January 24, 2005, as a result of the Company's
name change back to AB Holding  Group Inc.,  which was approved by the Company's
shareholders, the Company's new trading symbol became "ABHG."

     As of March 1, 2005, there were  approximately 305 holders of record of the
Company's  Common Stock.  The Company  estimates there are  approximately  1,100
beneficial holders of the Company's Common Stock. The following table sets forth
the  range of high and low bid  prices  of the  Company's  Common  Stock for the
quarters  indicated  through  the fourth  quarter of 2004 as reported on the OTC
Bulletin Board:

Fourth quarter                                 $.50              $.30

2004:

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         OF OPERATION
         ------------

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
----------------------------

     The Company's  significant  accounting  policies are described in Note 1 to
the  financial  statements  included  in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.  The Company
believes its most critical  accounting  policies include inventory  obsolescence
reserves,  held for sale  assets  valuation  reserves,  allowance  for  doubtful
accounts,  accounting  for  warranty  reserves,  accounting  for  income  taxes,
recourse  obligation  reserves and previously  accounting  for pre-season  order
flooring  interest.  Most of these policies related to the Company's  historical
silage bagging operations and certain of the policies, may not necessarily apply
to, or have the same impact on, the Company's current or future operations.

     The $87,560  estimate for  inventory  obsolescence  reserves was  developed
using  inventory-aging  reports for finished  goods,  combined  with  historical
usage, and forecasted usage and inventory shelf life. The Company's estimates of
market value  incorporate  projections  of future sales volume by product class.
Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, in estimating  the market value of parts
inventory items,  the Company  reviewed current  inventory levels in relation to
sales  forecasts  and  adjusted  the  valuation  reserve  accordingly.  For  the
remaining  categories of inventory,  the Company  established a reserve  balance
based on the aging of the specific inventory items. As trends in those variables
changed, the percentages applied to the inventory aging categories were updated.

     The  $174,326  estimate  for assets held for sale  valuation  reserves  was
developed  using the Company's  fixed asset report,  combined with  estimates of
fair market  value,  marketability,  usability/specialization  of the asset by a
potential purchaser,  and asset life of those remaining assets held for sale. As
trends in these variables change,  the assets held for sale valuation reserve is
updated.

2 Includes loans from shareholders and deferred taxes.
3 Includes $696 of preferred stock (2000-2003)

<PRE>
     The $163,468  estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised of a
specific account  analysis which addresses  accounts over 90 days past due and a
general  reserve  of  $10,000,  which is  deemed  appropriate  for the  level of
remaining  receivables carried by the Company from its former operations.  Prior
to the closing of the Asset Sale, accounts where specific information  indicated
a potential loss may exist were reviewed and a specific  reserve against amounts
due was recorded.  As additional  information  became  available,  such specific
account reserves were updated. Additionally, a general reserve was applied based
upon  historical  collection and write-off  experience.  As trends in historical
collection and write-offs changed, the general reserve was updated.

     The $13,430  estimate for  warranty  reserve was  developed  based upon the
estimated  future costs to be incurred  under the  provisions  of the  Company's
warranty  agreements  on its bags and  machines.  As a result of the Asset Sale,
Miller has assumed all warranty  obligations  for items sold after  November 30,
2004,  the date of closing.  Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company
reviewed its  historical  warranty  expense and current sales trends in specific
products  covered  under  warranty and reserves  were updated as trends in those
variables changed.

     The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method.
Deferred  tax  assets  and   liabilities  are  recognized  for  the  future  tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected  to apply to  taxable  income  in the  years in which  those  temporary
differences  are expected to be recovered or settled.  Valuation  allowances are
established to reduce potential  deferred tax assets when it is more likely than
not that all or some  portion  of  potential  deferred  tax  assets  will not be
realized.  The Company has established a $3,045,000  valuation allowance against
its tax assets as of December 31, 2004

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  the Company  estimated  its future
interest that would be incurred by the Company  associated  with sales under its
dealer pre-season order program.  At the time of sale, the Company reduced sales
revenue and accrued a liability for the estimated  future  interest  obligation.
The Company  estimated its future interest  obligation  pursuant to the terms of
its  pre-season  order program and the shipping  periods  defined  therein.  The
Company  estimated that machinery  shipped between October and May of each year,
would be sold at the dealer  level by the end of May and  accrued  an  estimated
future  interest  liability  accordingly  (ranging  from  30 to 210  days).  For
machinery  shipped after May, the Company estimated (since bagging season was in
full swing) that it would incur interest for  approximately 30 days, and accrued
an estimated liability accordingly.  For all other products, the Company accrued
an estimated future interest  liability  (ranging from 30 to 180 days) under the
assumptions that the product would be sold at the dealer level by the end of the
respective  shipping  periods as defined in the pre-season  order  program.  For
additional  products ordered and shipped outside the defined  shipping  periods,
the Company accrued an estimated  future interest  liability of approximately 30
days, which according to the pre-season order program, the Company paid interest
through  the end of the  month  of  shipment.  This  program  and the  Company's
obligation for interest ceased with the Asset Sale on November 30, 2004.

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company  periodically  assigned
some of its trade accounts receivable to various third-party  financing sources.
These accounts were assigned with or without recourse  depending on the specific
accounts  assigned.  The Company  reviewed on a monthly  basis,  those  accounts
assigned with recourse to determine  their payment  history with the third-party
financing source and estimated if any accrual was necessary for potential future
recourse  obligations.  At December 31, 2004,  the balance of assigned  accounts
with recourse was $377,465. The Company determined that at December 31, 2004, no
accrual  was  necessary  for  potential  future  recourse  obligations  with its
third-party financing sources.

OVERVIEW
--------

     As discussed in the Recent Developments  section,  substantially all of the
operating  assets of the Company,  which  accounted for all of the operations of
the Company, were sold to Miller on November 30, 2004. Following the Asset Sale,
the  Company  had no  ongoing  rights to any  benefits  derived  from its former
operations.  The Company's  operations and the gain on the sale recorded  during
the year ended December 31, 2004, are not indicative of the Company's  operating
results going forward.

     Prior to the  closing of the Asset Sale,  the core  business of the Company
was  historically  seasonal  due to the  harvest  seasons in North  America  and
Europe.  The Company's  machinery  tended to be purchased in anticipation of the
next harvest  season,  so most of the sales of machinery  occurred in the spring
and summer.  This required the Company to carry significant amounts of inventory
to meet rapid delivery  requirements of customers.  Bag sales tended to occur as
the harvest  season  approached in the summer,  and during the harvest season in
the fall. In September 2002, the Company took steps to counteract seasonality by
developing  and  introducing  its  pre-season  ordering  program,   whereby  the
Company's dealers placed their next year's annual product  requirements order in
advance and utilized one of the Company's  third party  financing  sources.  The
pre-season  program  allowed the Company to know in advance its  production  mix
which in turn provided the Company with the ability to level its  production and
flexibility  in customer  shipments.  During  2003,  the Company  expanded  this
program by allowing  dealers to finance  through  their local bank,  rather than
requiring them to utilize one of the Company's  third-party  financing programs.
This however,  brought  seasonality back into play for the Company, as shipments
under the dealer bank program  were at the timing of the dealer  rather than the
Company.  The Company's trade-off with shipment  flexibility  however, was lower
overall financing costs under the dealer bank program.  Approximately 50% of the
Company's  dealers  used the local dealer bank  financing  program  option.  The
pre-season order program was a program under which the Company paid the flooring
interest for its dealers and paid a volume  discount to its dealers based upon a
sliding scale for the volume of orders placed by and shipped to the dealer under
the program.

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,  the outlook for the  remainder  of
the year and into 2005  indicated that milk prices would remain above the record
low levels seen during  early 2003 of $9.11,  and were  forecast to settle above
$12.  The  following  chart  outlines  the  historical  monthly milk prices from
January  2003 through  November  2004 as  published  by the U.S.  Department  of

     Dairy  farmers  began seeing  increases in their monthly milk checks during
the first quarter of 2004, but continued to remain cautious during 2004, despite
continued low interest rates, on increasing their capital expenditures,  as milk
prices fell off the highs seen earlier  during 2004 and began settling back down
to a forecasted  level of between  $12-$13 into 2005.  Management  believed that
once  sustained,  prolonged  upward  movement in U.S.  milk prices and breakeven
yearly  milk price  averages  of above $12 were seen,  farmers  would be able to
repay their existing,  older obligations which had mounted from the persistently
low  milk  prices  over the last  several  years,  and  purchase  the  Company's
products.  However, during the second quarter of 2004, milk prices began falling
off their highs of May 2004,  and end users  seemed to believe  that milk prices
would  settle  back to  below  breakeven  levels  for  them,  despite  forecasts
indicating milk prices averaging over $12 into 2005. As a result, farmers became
over cautious  again on their capital  expenditures  and were  conserving  their
operating cash.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003
--------------------------------------

     Net  sales  for the  year  ended  December  31,  2004  decreased  3.08%  to
$20,839,980  compared to  $21,502,654  for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net
sales  were  down for the year as a  result  of the  Asset  Sale,  coupled  with
continued,  guarded  customer  buying  attitudes  resulting  from the prolonged,
depressed U.S. milk price situation in the dairy industry.  Further contributing
to the decline in sales for the year was the fact that dealers'  were  uncertain
about  Ag-Bag's  future and the then pending Asset Sale, as dealers were waiting
to see the transition plans of Miller,  relative to their dealer  operations and
programs  for  sales  of  the  Company's  products  before  ordering  additional
products.  Additionally,  the Company's  dealers were  conservative when placing
orders under the pre-season  order program for 2003-04  resulting from carryover
of  inventory  at the dealer  level from the prior year.  Some of the  Company's
dealers had to re-order  machinery  during the year,  outside of the  pre-season
order  program,  which helped to partially  offset some of the sales decline for
the year.

     Also  contributing  to the  decline  in sales  for the  year was  increased
incentive programs offered by the Company,  prior to its Asset Sale, to increase
market  share  during  the  second  and third  quarters  of 2004,  coupled  with
continued strong competition in the silage bag market, as farmers looked for the
most economically priced bag, with lesser consideration for quality and customer
service.

     Net machine sale revenue for the year decreased  8.70% and bag sale revenue
declined  10.09%  compared to the same period of 2003.  Net machine and bag sale
revenue  declined  for the year as a result of  dealers  being  cautious  on new
capital  expenditures  with the milk prices  beginning to fall during the second
quarter,  coupled  with  dealer  uncertainty  about  Ag-Bag's  future  with  the
announcement of the pending Asset Sale on August 16, 2004.  Dealers  appeared to
wait to see the transition plans of Miller,  relative to their dealer operations
and  programs  for sales of the  Company's  products.  This decline was slightly
offset by dealers ordering  additional  machines outside of the pre-season order
program  from  their  conservative  orders  placed a year ago under the  2003-04
pre-season order program,  and by the fact the Company had a large international
machine sale that occurred during the second quarter of 2004. As a percentage of
total  revenue for the year 2004,  machine  revenue  declined 6% and bag revenue
declined 9%. (See "Item 1. Business - General.") The following table  identifies
the number of machines sold by size by the Company in 2004, prior to the closing
of the Asset Sale, compared to 2003:

     Machine  sales were directly  tied to farmers'  income and therefore  their
ability to purchase new  equipment.  The total number of bagging  machines  that
were in the marketplace drove the Company's bag and parts sales. However,  there
was not a perfect correlation between the Company's bag sales and machine sales,
as the  Company's  and  competitors'  bags were  interchangeable  on all bagging
machinery in the industry. The Company could not estimate with any certainty the
total number of machines or bags used in the industry.

     For the year ended  December  31, 2004,  the Company  sold five  composting
systems in addition to compost bag sales,  generating  approximately $820,000 in
revenue,  compared to two systems  sold and compost bag sales for the year ended
December 31, 2003, generating  approximately $524,000 in revenue.  Compost sales
were up for the year as a result  of system  sales  expanding  to the  Company's
silage dealers for dual purpose use in their dairy operations,  and for use by a
Canadian dealer in a Canadian Government

funded  composting  project,  coupled  with  increased  compost  bag usage  from
previous systems sold into the marketplace.

     Although the Company sold its products primarily through a worldwide dealer
network,  certain  sales were made  directly to large  volume  customers  when a
dealer was not present in the customer's geographic market. For each of the last
three years,  the Company  estimated that direct sales made up between 10-15% of
total  sales.  The gross  margin  realized on the  Company's  direct  sales were
typically  within 1-3% of those sales  realized  through  the  Company's  dealer
network.  However, various economic, volume and market factors in the geographic
area  impacted the ultimate  margin.  Beginning in late 2002,  the Company began
focusing its  marketing  efforts more on dealer  development  and  expanding its
dealer network rather than a focus towards direct  selling.  As a result of this
shift,  the  Company's  sales mix began to favor more dealer  sales prior to the
Asset Sale.

     International  sales for the Company in 2004 were up in  comparison to 2003
as a result of a large sale to a customer  in Russia,  despite  drought  weather
conditions in international dairy areas where the Company had a large portion of
its international  customer base,  coupled with continued  economic  uncertainty
affecting the international  farm economy,  resulting largely from BSE (mad cow)
concerns.  International  sales to  Germany  were up for the year as a result of
strong machine demand from customers of the Company's  former German dealer.  In
1999, the Company's former German dealer began  manufacturing  mid-sized bagging
machines in Germany under a license from the Company.  As a result,  the Company
no longer sold mid-sized machines directly to its former German dealer. Instead,
the Company received a royalty fee for each mid-sized machine sold by its former
German dealer, which was recorded as other income. In 1997, the Company formed a
German  joint  venture in which the Company  owned a 50% interest and its former
German dealer owned the remaining 50%. The joint venture distributed bags to the
Company's German and European  dealers.  On April 27, 2004, the Company sold its
investment  in its German joint  venture to its former  German dealer to provide
the  Company  with  working  capital.  The  Company  recognized  $36,562  as  an
extraordinary gain from this sale.  Previously,  the Company's earnings from the
joint  venture were  reported as other income and were  accounted  for using the
equity method.

     Gross profit as a percentage of sales  decreased  61.45% for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease for the year
was the result of the Asset Sale, coupled with a slowdown in factory utilization
at the Company's production  facilities where manufacturing costs were not fully
absorbed,  resulting from dealer caution and  uncertainty,  and placing  machine
orders,  as a result of the impending Asset Sale, which was announced during the
peak of the Company's  normally busy third quarter.  As a result,  the Company's
facilities  were running only at  approximately  55%-60%  capacity during normal
peak times. The decline was partially offset by some dealers ordering additional
product  outside of their  2003-04  pre-season  order which  yielded the Company
slightly higher margins as a result of reduced discounts,  coupled with improved
margins on sales of some of the Company's  used  equipment sold during the year,
in addition to stable  margins on the  Company's  "core"  smaller-sized  bagging
machines,  resulting from cost reductions  implemented during late 2003 to lower
the Company's fixed manufacturing overheads.

     Selling  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased  33.31% to
$1,753,339  compared to  $2,628,971  for the year ended  December 31, 2003.  The
decrease  for the  year was the  result  of lower  commissions  and  third-party
financing fees caused by lower sales volumes,  lower overall  advertising costs,
and lower personnel,  benefit,  and travel costs associated with cost reductions
implemented late in 2003 which were fully in place during 2004.

     Administrative  expenses  for the year ended  December  31, 2004  increased
80.51% to  $5,073,867  compared to  $2,810,904  for the year ended  December 31,
2003.  The  increase  for the  year was the  result  of  recording  discontinued
operational  costs from the Asset Sale,  coupled with  increases  in  insurance,
annual meeting,  and bad debt expense and patent  development  costs, which were
partially  offset by decreases  in  administrative  salaries and general  office
expenses.

     During the year ended December 31, 2004,  the Company  recorded a gain from
the sale of  assets  of  $1,380,383.  The gain  resulted  from the sale of fixed
assets and  intangibles  to Miller on November  30,  2004  pursuant to the Asset
Sale, coupled with fully depreciated miscellaneous  manufacturing equipment sold
throughout the year, in addition to the sale of a parcel of vacant land owned by
the Company during the second quarter of 2004.

     Research  and  development  expenses  for the year ended  December 31, 2004
increased 3.03% to $143,389 compared to $139,160 for the year ended December 31,
2003. The increase for the year was the result of ongoing research and continued
development  and testing  newer  designs of the  Company's  larger-sized  silage
bagging machine and compost machine modifications and recycling development,  in
addition to continuing  ongoing  research  regarding new silage and  nutritional
studies of bagged feed and their  effects on animal  production.  As a result of
the Asset Sale,  Miller  absorbed  all  ongoing  research  activities  and their
related costs after the closing of the Asset Sale on November 30, 2004.

     Interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 2004  increased  2.90% to
$252,786 compared to $245,656 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase
for the year was the result of the  Company  utilizing  a larger  portion of its
credit line, coupled with an increase in the interest rate on its line of credit
as a result of an amendment to the Company's  credit  agreement during the first
quarter  of 2004  and  implementation  by  Wells  Fargo  Business  Credit  of an
additional  interest rate premium of 2 1/4% during the third quarter of 2004, as
a result of a default by the  Company  of two of its  financial  covenants.  The
Company's operating line of credit with Wells Fargo Business Credit was paid off
on December 2, 2004, with a portion of the proceeds from the Asset Sale.

     Joint  venture  equity and royalty  income for the year ended  December 31,
2004  decreased  48.04% to  $219,849  compared  to  $423,074  for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The decrease for the year was the result of decreased  income
from the joint  venture as a result of the Company  selling its 50%  interest in
the joint venture to its former German Dealer on April 27, 2004, and recognizing
an extraordinary  gain from the sale on its investment of $36,562,  coupled with
the fact in 2003, the Company  received a special  one-time folding royalty from
the  Company's  former  joint  venture  upon  the  sale of  depreciated  folding
equipment to the joint venture which occurred during the second quarter of 2003.
(See  "Item 8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data.")  This  year's
decrease was partially offset by increased machine  royalties  received in 2004.
(See  "International  Sales" discussion above.) With the Asset Sale, Miller will
receive all future royalties that were previously received by the Company.

     The  Company's  effective  income tax rate for the year ended  December 31,
2004 was zero  compared  to 41.40% for the year ended  December  31,  2003.  The
effective tax rate was zero for the year due to the fact the Company established
an  additional  $1,467,228  valuation  allowance  during  the year  against  its
deferred tax assets.  The  valuation  allowance was  established  because of the
Company's expected inability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and
research  tax  credits,  which was  partially  offset by the fact the  Company's
income from its  international  royalties are not taxable in the United  States,
the  extraterritorial  income exclusion  provisions of the current United States
tax code, and as a result of the Company having no ongoing  business  operations
due to the Asset Sale which closed on November 30, 2004.

     The  Company  recorded  an  extraordinary  gain from the sale of its German
joint  venture of $36,562 for the year ended  December  31,  2004.  On April 27,
2004,  the  Company  sold  its  investment  in the BAW  Joint  Venture  (Budissa
Agrodienstleistungen Und Warenhandels) to its former German dealer, BAG (Budissa
Agroservice),  to provide the Company with working capital.  Prior to this date,
the Company had a 50% interest in the BAW Joint  Venture which was accounted for
under the equity method of  accounting.  (See "Joint Venture Equity and Royalty"
discussion above.)

     Net loss from discontinued  operations for the year ended December 31, 2004
was $4,313,027  compared to $2,753,715 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
decrease for the year was the result of lower sales and gross profit,  increased
interest,  administrative,  and research and development expenses resulting from
the Company discontinuing operations as a result of the Asset Sale, coupled with
lower joint venture  equity and royalty  income,  which was partially  offset by
decreases  in selling and an  increased  gain on sale of assets due to the Asset
Sale.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002
--------------------------------------

     For the year  ended  December  31,  2003,  net  sales  decreased  20.91% to
$21,502,654  compared to $27,189,140 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Sales
were down for the year as a result of the slow U.S. farm economy which  resulted
from the lowest U.S.  milk  prices  seen since 2000.  Milk prices were at record
lows  for the  first  half of the year and saw  some  improvement  in the  third
quarter of 2003,  but began to fall off again during the fourth quarter of 2003.
The outlook for 2004 indicates that milk prices will remain above the record low
levels seen during early 2003 of $9.11 and are  anticipated to reach the $14-$15
range over the summer of 2004.  Farmers began seeing  increases in their monthly
milk checks during the third quarter of 2003, but continued to remain  cautious,
despite continued low interest rates, on increasing their capital  expenditures.
Management believes that once sustained,  prolonged upward movement in U.S. milk
prices are seen, farmers will be able to repay their existing  obligations which
mounted  from  the  persistently  low milk  prices  over  the  last  year.  Also
contributing  to the decline was  continued  tightening in  agricultural  credit
availability, as a result of the depressed U.S. milk prices, coupled with rising
supplemental grain feed costs brought on by the summer drought conditions in the
U.S. In addition,  increased  volume  discounts from the  implementation  of the
Company's  pre-season order program coupled with continued strong competition in
the silage bag market,  as farmers  look for the most  economically  priced bag,
without considering quality and customer service, contributed to the decline.

     Machine  sale  revenue for the year  declined  23.55% and bag sale  revenue
declined 17.15% compared to 2002.  Machine sale revenue for the year declined as
a  result  of the  U.S.  milk  price  and farm  economic  conditions  previously
discussed.  As a percentage of total revenue for the year 2003,  machine revenue
declined 3% and bag revenue  increased  1%. (See "Item 1.  Business - General.")

     Machine  sales are directly  tied to farmers'  income and  therefore  their
ability to purchase new equipment. The total number of bagging machines that are
in the marketplace drives the Company's bag and parts sales.  However,  there is
not a perfect  correlation between the Company's bag sales and machine sales, as
the Company's and competitors' bags are interchangeable on all bagging machinery
in the industry. The Company cannot estimate with any certainty the total number
of machines or bags used in the industry.

     For the year ended  December  31,  2003,  the Company  sold two  composting
systems in addition to compost bag sales,  generating  approximately $524,000 in
revenue,  compared to four systems sold and compost bag sales for the year ended
December 31, 2002, generating  approximately $592,000 in revenue.  Compost sales
were  down for the year as a result of  current  economic  conditions  and tight
budgetary constraints for the Company's potential end users in the U.S.

     Although  the  Company  sells its  products  primarily  through a worldwide
dealer network, certain sales are made directly to large volume customers when a
dealer is not present in the customer's  geographic market. For each of the last
three years,  the Company  estimates that direct sales make up between 30-35% of
total  sales.  The gross  margin  realized  on the  Company's  direct  sales are
typically  within 1-3% of those sales  realized  through  the  Company's  dealer
network.  However, various economic, volume and market factors in the geographic
area impact the ultimate margin. The Company  anticipates its sales mix to begin
to favor  more  dealer  sales in the  future as a result of its  change of sales
focus during the later half of 2002. (See "Item 1. Business - Marketing.")

     International sales for the Company in 2003 were down in comparison to 2002
as a result of drought weather conditions in international dairy areas where the
Company has a large portion of its  international  customer  base,  coupled with
continued  economic  uncertainty   affecting  the  international  farm  economy,
resulting  largely from BSE (mad cow) concerns.  International  sales to Germany
remained  constant  compared to the prior year. In 1999,  the  Company's  German
dealer began manufacturing mid-sized bagging machines in Germany under a license
from the  Company.  Therefore,  the Company no longer sells  mid-sized  machines
directly to its German dealer.  Instead,  the Company receives a royalty fee for
each  mid-sized  machine sold by its German  dealer,  which is recorded as other
income.  In 1997, the Company formed a German joint venture in which the Company
owns a 50%  interest  and its German  dealer owns the  remaining  50%. The joint
venture  distributes  bags to the  Company's  German and European  dealers.  The
Company's  earnings  from the joint venture are reported as other income and are
accounted for using the equity method.  Approximately  $4.7 million in bag sales
and service were  distributed  through the venture  during 2003,  an increase of
27%, compared to approximately $3.7 million in bag sales and service for 2002.

     Gross profit as a percentage of sales  decreased  21.51% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to 2002.  The decrease for the year was the result of
lower  sales  volumes to cover fixed  operating  overheads,  coupled  with lower
margins on the  Company's  used  equipment  sold  during the year and  increases
incurred in the Company's inventory reserves.  The decrease was partially offset
by improved  margins on the  Company's  "core"  smaller  bagging  machines  from
production improvements made during 2002, in addition to lower warranty costs as
a result of the Company  passing on more of its warranty costs to its suppliers,
coupled with lower freight costs for the year resulting largely from the Company
streamlining its warehouse  locations  during 2002 to help in improving  overall
margins.   (See  "Item  1.  Business  -  Farm  Equipment  and  Products.")  Also
contributing  to the decline  for the year was an  increase in volume  discounts
(which  are  recorded  as  a  reduction   in  net  sales)  from  the   Company's
implementation of its pre-season order program,  as 2003 was the first full year
for this program and the related discount.

     Selling  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased  24.82% to
$2,628,971  compared to  $3,496,672  for the year ended  December 31, 2002.  The
decrease in selling  expenses  for the year was the result of lower  commissions
and  third  party  financing  fees  from  lower  sales  volumes,  lower  overall
advertising  costs,  coupled  with lower  personnel,  benefit,  and travel costs
associated with sales personnel

<PRE>
reductions  made in late 2002 in connection  with the shift more towards selling
through the  Company's  dealer  network,  partially  offset by increased  dealer
incentive costs.

     Administrative  expenses  for the year ended  December  31, 2003  increased
2.59% to $2,810,904 compared to $2,739,811 for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The  increase  for the year was the result of  increased  insurance  expense and
higher   professional  fees  related  to  public  company  compliance  with  the
Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002, in addition to slightly higher patent costs,  which
were  partially  offset by lower bad debt,  general  office  and  administrative
personnel expenses.

     During the year ended December 31, 2003,  the Company  recorded a gain from
the sale of assets of  $185,358.  The gain  largely  resulted  from  depreciated
folding  equipment  that was sold to its German joint venture  during the second
quarter of 2003,  in  addition  to the sale of fully  depreciated  miscellaneous
manufacturing  equipment and vehicles which occurred during the third quarter of
2003.  During the second quarter of 2003,  the Company  recorded a gain from the
sale of assets of $345,837.  However, under the equity method of accounting with
the Company's 50% ownership in the German joint venture,  the Company's share of
the gain of $172,918  was deferred  and will be  recognized  as the German joint
venture  depreciates the folding equipment over its useful life. During the year
ended  December 31, 2003,  $86,454 of the deferred gain was  recognized as joint
venture income.

     Research  and  development  expenses  for the year ended  December 31, 2003
decreased  36.74% to $139,160  compared to $219,980 for the year ended  December
31, 2002. The decrease in research and development expenses for the year was the
result of completed research on various projects undertaken regarding new silage
and nutritional  studies of bagged feed and their effects on animal  production,
offset by continued research and testing in this area as well. Additionally, the
Company  continued  testing on the newer  design of the  Company's  larger-sized
silage-bagging machines, and compost machine modification and development.

     Interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased  21.78% to
$245,656 compared to $314,068 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease
for the year was the result of the Company  utilizing a smaller credit  facility
as a result of the Company  changing its  collection  methods  during the fourth
quarter of 2002  whereby the  Company's  customers  no longer have open  account
terms,  which was partially  offset by increased  interest rates on the facility
during the year.  The Company's  customers now have the option to pay in advance
for their order,  utilize their own  established  credit,  or utilize one of the
Company's third-party financing sources or programs offered for their purchases.

     Joint  venture  equity and royalty  income for the year ended  December 31,
2003  increased  34.23% to  $423,074  compared  to  $315,196  for the year ended
December 31, 2002. The increase for the year was the result of increased  income
from the joint venture as a result of the  recognition  of deferred  folder sale
gain (see discussion of gain from sale of assets above),  coupled with a special
one-time folding royalty received from the Company's joint venture upon the sale
of the folding  equipment to the joint venture which occurred  during the second
quarter of 2003. (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.")

     The Company's  effective tax rate for the year ended  December 31, 2003 was
41%. The effective  tax rate was an expense  during the year due to the fact the
Company  established a $1,577,772  valuation  allowance against its deferred tax
assets in respect to the  Company's  ability to utilize its Net  Operating  Loss
carryforwards  and  research  tax  credits,  which  was  offset  by the fact the
Company's  income  from its German  joint  venture is not  taxable in the United
States,  and the  extraterritorial  income  exclusion  provisions of the current

     Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $2,753,715  compared to a
net loss of $663,988 for the year ended  December 31, 2002. The net loss for the
year was the  result  of lower  sales  and gross  margins,  lower  miscellaneous
income,  increased  administrative expenses, and the establishment of a deferred
tax valuation

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
--------------------------------

     In December 2004, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No.
29."  The  guidance  in  APB  Opinion  No.  29,   "Accounting  for  Non-monetary
Transactions,"  is based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary  assets
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance
in APB Opinion No. 29, however,  included certain  exceptions to that principle.
SFAS  No.  153  amends  APB  Opinion  No.  29 to  eliminate  the  exception  for
non-monetary  exchanges  of similar  productive  assets and  replaces  it with a
general  exception  for  exchanges  of  non-monetary  assets  that  do not  have
commercial  substance.  A non-monetary  exchange has commercial substance if the
future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result
of the exchange.  SFAS No. 153 is effective for non-monetary  asset exchanges in
fiscal  periods  beginning  after  June 15,  2005.  The  implementation  of this
statement is not expected to have a material  impact on the Company's  financial
statements.

     In  December  2004,   the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  123R  (revised   2004),
"Share-Based  Payment,"  which is a revision  of SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation."  SFAS  No.  123R  supersedes  APB  Opinion  No.  25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"  and amends SFAS No. 95,  "Statement
of Cash Flows."  Generally,  the  approach in  Statement  123R is similar to the
approach  described in SFAS 123,  however,  SFAS 123R  requires all  share-based
payments  to  employees,  including  grants of  employee  stock  options,  to be
recognized  in the  income  statement  based on their  fair  values.  Pro  forma
disclosures seen in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of
Accounting  Principles - Stock Option Plans," will no longer be an  alternative.
SFAS No. 123R is effective for interim  periods  beginning  after June 15, 2005.
The  implementation  of this statement is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company's financial statements.

     In  November  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  151,  "Inventory  Costs,  an
Amendment of ARB No. 43,  Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 amends ARB 43,  Chapter 4, to
clarify that the abnormal amounts of idle facility  expense,  freight,  handling
costs and wasted  materials  (spoilage) be recognized as current period charges.
It also requires that allocation of fixed  production  overheads to the costs of
conversion be based on the normal  capacity of the production  facilities.  SFAS
No. 151 is effective for inventory  costs incurred during fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005.  The  implementation  of this  statement is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

     In June  2003,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  150,  "Accounting  for  Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." This
statement  establishes  standards  regarding  classification  and measurement of
certain  financial  instruments  with  characteristics  of both  liabilities and
equity. It requires financial  instruments within the scope of this statement to
be classified as liabilities (or an asset in some circumstances).  Many of these
financial  instruments were previously  classified as equity.  This statement is
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003,
and was  otherwise  effective  at the  beginning  of the  first  interim  period
beginning  after June 15, 2003.  For financial  instruments  created  before the
issuance  date of this  statement  and still  existing at the  beginning  of the
interim  period of adoption,  transition is achieved by reporting the cumulative
effect  of a change  in an  accounting  principle  by  initially  measuring  the
financial  instruments at fair value. The  implementation  of this statement did
not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

     In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  This  statement  amends and
clarifies  financial  accounting  and  reporting  for  derivative   instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for





                                       28

<DIV STYLE="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always">&nbsp;</DIV>
<PRE>
hedging  activities under SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities."  The  implementation  of this statement did not have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements.

     In  January  2003,  the  FASB  issued   Interpretation  No.  46  (FIN  46),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation clarifies the
application  of Accounting  Research  Bulletin No. 51,  "Consolidated  Financial
Statements," and requires existing  unconsolidated variable interest entities to
be  consolidated  by  their  primary   beneficiaries  if  the  entities  do  not
effectively disperse risks among parties involved.  This interpretation explains
how to identify variable  interest  entities and how an enterprise  assesses its
interests in a variable  interest  entity to decide whether to consolidate  that
entity.  In December  2003,  FASB made revisions and delayed  implementation  of
certain  provisions of FIN 46. As a public entity that is not a "Small  Business
Issuer,"  the  Company  is now  required  to apply FIN 46 to all  unconsolidated
variable  interest  entities no later than March 31, 2004, with the exception of
unconsolidated special-purpose entities, which had an implementation deadline of
December 31, 2003.  Special-purpose  entities for this provision are expected to
include entities whose activities are primarily  related to  securitizations  or
other forms of asset-backed  financings or single-lessee  leasing  arrangements.
The Company was associated with a potential variable interest entity through its
investment in BAW, prior to its sale in April 2004.  Management  determined that
BAW was a variable  interest entity,  but concluded that the Company was not the
primary beneficiary.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
-------------------------------

     Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, the seasonal nature of the northern
hemisphere  farming  industry,  the  production  time for equipment and the time
required to prepare bags for use,  required the Company to manufacture and carry
high inventories to meet rapid delivery requirements. In particular, the Company
needed to maintain a  significant  level of bags during the spring and summer to
meet the sales  demands  during the harvest  season.  The Company  used  working
capital and trade  credit to increase its  inventory  so that it had  sufficient
inventory  levels  available to meet its sales  demands.  Although the Company's
pre-season ordering program provided it with some flexibility in production, the
Company needed to maintain adequate  inventory levels for those customers,  both
old and  new,  who  ordered  or  re-ordered  product  outside  of  this  program
throughout the year.

     Prior to the Asset Sale,  the Company  relied on its  suppliers  to provide
trade  credit to  enable  the  Company  to build its  inventory.  The  Company's
suppliers  previously  provided  sufficient  trade credit to meet the demand and
were flexible with their payment terms (including extended payment arrangements)
provided to the Company.  However,  as a result Asset Sale,  no assurance can be
given that  creditors  will continue to provide  sufficient  trade credit in the
future for the Company's ongoing corporate  administrative expenses of remaining
a non-operating public shell, until it can either dissolve and liquidate or sell
the remaining public shell to another party by merger or another method.

     At  December  31,  2004,  the  Company  had cash and  cash  equivalents  of
$2,982,728.  The  increase  in cash and cash  equivalents  was the result of the
proceeds received from the Asset Sale.

     Accounts  receivable  decreased  48.46% at  December  31,  2004 to $632,132
compared to $1,226,390 at December 31, 2003.  The decrease was the result of the
Asset Sale,  in  addition  to lower sales for the last  quarter of the year as a
result of the uncertainty  about Ag-Bag from the announcement of a pending Asset
Sale in  August  2004.  At  December  31,  2004,  the  Company  still  had  some
receivables  outstanding  from its former  operations  under its old  collection
method of providing terms for certain  customers.  The Company has  subsequently
collected on its receivables  outstanding,  and as of February 28, 2005, had net
receivables of  approximately  $190,000  remaining.  The Company has established
adequate  reserves  ($163,468  at  December  31,  2004  compared  to $204,081 at
December 31, 2003)  against  accounts  receivable  in the event that some of the
remaining accounts become uncollectible.

<PRE>
     Prior  to  the  closing  of the  Asset  Sale,  the  Company  relied  on its
third-party financing sources and the dealers' own established credit with their
local banks, to provide funding for the Company's dealers' and retail customers'
purchases  under  the  pre-season  order  program.  The  Company's   third-party
financing sources and dealers' local banks previously provided sufficient credit
to the Company's dealers for the Company to receive payment. As of September 30,
2004, the Company began processing  charges for its  customers/dealers  who used
John Deere Credit's Farmplan program,  on a preferred customer basis only and no
longer  accepted  charges  for  those  who were  merchant  authorized.  Farmplan
preferred was more advantageous to the  customer/dealer  as they received better
interest   rates  and  payment   options  than  under  the   merchant   program.
Additionally,  this reduced the Company's  potential  recourse  liability in the
event the customer/dealer failed to pay their account under the Farmplan program
terms. (See "Critical Accounting Policies.") With the Asset Sale, the Company no
longer  relies on its  third-party  financing  sources,  as it no longer has any
operating activities requiring such financing.

     Inventory  decreased  100% at  December  31,  2004 to a net  value  of $-0-
compared to $5,781,345 at December 31, 2003. The decrease in inventory  resulted
from the Asset Sale. (See Item 1. "Business - Recent Developments.")

     Prepaid  expenses and other current assets decreased 47.95% at December 31,
2004 to $131,074 compared to $251,808 at December 31, 2003. The decrease was the
result  of the  Asset  Sale and  discontinuing  its  operating  activities.  The
remaining  other  current  assets  represent  the cash  surrender  value on life
insurance  policies owned by the Company in which it is the  beneficiary,  which
will be converted into cash during 2005. Prior to the Asset Sale, this remaining
asset was  classified  as a long term other  asset,  but was  reclassified  to a
current asset, as a result of the Asset Sale.

     Held for sale property,  plant and equipment, net at December 31, 2004, was
$1,692,103. The Company's remaining property, plant and equipment from the Asset
Sale,  was  reclassified  to a current asset as a result of the Asset Sale.  The
Company  currently has its remaining assets not acquired by Miller for sale, and
anticipates  converting  these  assets to cash  during  2005,  so it can  either
dissolve and  liquidate or sell the  remaining  public shell to another party by
merger or another method. The Company established a reserve against its held for
sale assets at December 31, 2004 in the amount of $174,326.

     Intangible  assets at  December  31,  2004  decreased  to $-0-  compared to
$15,066 at December  31,  2003.  The  decrease was the result of the sale of the
Company's  intangible  assets  to  Miller  in the  Asset  Sale,  and  by  normal
amortization expense for the year.

     The BAW joint venture asset decreased to $-0- at December 31, 2004 compared
to $376,974 at December 31, 2003. The decrease was the result of the sale of the
Company's  investment in its German joint venture  during the second  quarter of
2004, and recognizing the balance of the deferred gain,  under the equity method
of accounting, of the Company's share of gain from the sale of folding equipment
sold to the German joint venture in the second  quarter of 2003.  The balance of
deferred gain from the folding equipment  recognized for the year ended December
31, 2004 was $86,464,  which  occurred  prior to the end of the second  quarter.
(See "Joint Venture Equity and Royalty" discussion.)

     Other  assets  decreased  100% at  December  31,  2004 to $-0-  compared to
$491,513 at December 31, 2003.  The decrease was the result of a decrease in the
cash  surrender  value of insurance on policies  maintained  by the Company,  in
which the Company was the  beneficiary,  by redeeming the Company's  outstanding
preferred  stock with the life  insurance  policy the Company  maintained on the
owner of the preferred stock during the third quarter of 2004, and reclassifying
the remaining cash surrender value asset on the life insurance policies owned by
the Company, to a current asset, as the Company intends to convert its remaining
policies into cash during 2005. (See "Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets"
discussion above.)

     The Company paid off its operating line of credit on December 2, 2004, from
a portion of the  proceeds of the Asset Sale.  Pursuant  to its  agreement  with
Wells Fargo Business Credit, as a result of the early termination

                                       30

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Page Break" FSL="Workstation" -->
<DIV STYLE="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always">&nbsp;</DIV>
<PRE>
of the  Company's  line  of  credit,  the  Company  incurred  $60,000  in  early
termination fees in 2004. (See "Item 8. Financial  Statements and  Supplementary
Data.")  The line was subject to renewal on May 14,  2006.  Prior to December 2,
2004,  the  Company  had a  revolving  operating  line of credit with a limit of
$3,000,000,  secured by accounts receivable,  inventory, fixed asset blanket and
general intangibles, and bore interest at the bank's prime rate plus 4 3/4%. The
line of  credit  fluctuated  based  upon  production  needs  and the  timing  of
collection of the Company's  receivable  balances.  Additionally,  the Company's
borrowing base  fluctuated as receivables and inventory  changed.  The borrowing
base was equal to (1) the lesser of the  maximum  line  amount or (2) the sum of
70% of  eligible  accounts  receivable  plus the  lesser of (i) 40% of  eligible
inventory  or (ii) $2  million.  The line of credit was  subject to certain  net
worth and earnings covenants, and an annual capital expenditure limit. From June
30, 2004 until  payoff on December 2, 2004,  the Company was in default with two
of its financial covenants under its revolving operating line of credit with its
primary lender,  Wells Fargo Business Credit.  The Company was not in compliance
with the net worth and earnings before taxes covenants,  for its fiscal quarters
ended June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004.  These  defaults were cured with the
payoff of the facility.

     Management  believes  that funds  generated  from the Asset  Sale,  and the
anticipated sales of the remaining property,  plant and equipment held for sale,
and other current assets to be converted  into cash,  will be sufficient to meet
the Company's cash  requirements of remaining a public shell through 2005, until
the Company can either dissolve and liquidate or sell the remaining public shell
to another party by merger or another method.

     On December 18, 2000,  the Company  entered into an agreement with Dresdner
Bank to guarantee up to 511,292 Euro ($535,987 US) as security for an additional
cash credit  facility of the Company's  former German joint  venture.  In August
2003,  the guarantee was reduced by Dresdner Bank to 250,000 Euro ($312,500 US).
On April 27, 2004,  upon the sale of the  Company's  German joint  venture,  the
Company was  relieved  of its bank  guarantee  with  Dresdner  Bank,  and has no
further guarantees or obligations outstanding with Dresdner Bank.

     The current  portion of long-term  debt at December 31, 2004 was $1,071,488
compared to $182,706 at December 31, 2003. The increase in the Company's current
portion of  long-term  debt was the result of the  reclassification  of the debt
from  long-term  to current,  as a result of the Asset Sale.  Additionally,  the
underlying  security  for the debt is  secured  by the  Company's  held for sale
property, plant and equipment remaining.

     Accounts payable decreased 72.85% at December 31, 2004 to $254,406 compared
to $936,953 at December 31, 2003. The decrease was the result of the Asset Sale.
Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, as previously disclosed in the Company's
public filings,  the Company slowed its  manufacturing  process during the third
quarter of 2004,  resulting from dealer  uncertainty for equipment orders due to
the pending  Asset Sale,  and market  conditions  stemming from declines in milk
prices.  The decline was partially offset by extended term payment  arrangements
provided by some of the  Company's  principal  suppliers.  (See  "Trade  Credit"
discussion above.)

     Discontinued  operational  costs  payable as of  December  31,  2004,  were
$2,124,662.  These costs were the result of the  closing of the Asset Sale,  and
reflect  the  Company's   estimate  of  remaining  costs   associated  with  the
discontinuance  and  winding  down of its  operations.  (See "Item 8.  Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.")

     Accrued  expenses and other  current  liabilities  (excluding  discontinued
operational  costs payable) in total  decreased  62.76% at December 31, 2004, to
$358,170  compared  to  $961,731 at December  31,  2003.  The  decrease in total
accrued  expenses and other current  liabilities  for the year was the result of
the Asset Sale, coupled with decreased payroll,  commission and benefit accruals
from personnel terminations resulting

                                       31

<PRE>
from the Asset Sale. Additionally,  since the Company no longer has a pre-season
order program  resulting from the Asset Sale, it no longer has any  requirements
to accrue volume discounts,  program  incentives or flooring interest  accruals,
which,  along with lower accrued  warranty from the Company no longer having any
operations, also helped to decrease total accrued expenses.

     In 1997, the Nasdaq listing requirements were substantially  expanded.  The
Company does not currently qualify under the more stringent requirements because
the  price at which  its  Common  Stock is  trading  is below  the $1 per  share
minimum.  The Company was formally notified on January 13, 1999, that its Common
Stock was delisted from quotation on The Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market for failure to
meet the new listing  requirements.  The Company's Common Stock is now quoted on
the OTC Bulletin Board. The removal from quotation on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market
could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on the  Company's  ability  to  raise
additional  equity  capital  in a  public  stock  offering  should  that  become
necessary.

     The following table outlines the Company's future  contractual  obligations

FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

You should carefully  consider the following factors  regarding  forward-looking
statements and other information  included in this Annual Report.  The risks and
uncertainties  described below are not the only ones we face.  Additional  risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
also may impair our business operations.  If any of the following risks actually
occur,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  financial  results  could  be
materially adversely affected.

o    We may be unable to sell our remaining  held for sale  property,  plant and
     equipment.

         The Company is actively  looking for  purchasers of its remaining  held
         for sale property,  plant and equipment that was not acquired by Miller
         in the asset purchase  agreement.  However,  we may be unable to find a
         buyer for our  remaining  Warrenton,  Oregon and Blair,  Nebraska  real
         estate,  paint  booths and visual  computer  system  that  remains,  to
         convert  these  assets  to cash,  so that we can  either  dissolve  and
         liquidate or sell the remaining public shell to another party by merger
         or another method.

o    We may be  unable  to  find a  candidate  to sell or  merge  the  remaining
     non-operating public shell with.

         The Company is actively  working to convert its  remaining  assets into
         cash to clean the non-operating public shell in anticipation of finding
         a potential purchaser or merger candidate. However, we may be unable to
         clean the non-operating public shell and find a potential candidate for
         its sale or merger.

o    We may be unable to retain key  management and personnel as a result of the
     Asset Sale.

         The  Asset  Sale  may  adversely  impact  our  ability  to  retain  key
         management  and personnel who are involved in our business,  and assist
         with the winding down and sale of the  Company's  remaining  assets and
         non-operating public shell.

o    The  Company  no longer  has any source of  operating  revenues  and may be
     unable to obtain financing or credit.

         With the Asset Sale,  the  Company no longer has any ongoing  rights or
         benefits derived from its former operations.  Should the need arise for
         the  remaining  non-operating  public  shell to  acquire  financing  or
         credit; it may be unable to do so, since it no longer has any source of
         operating revenues.

o    We may lose the improper  assignment  of an  installment  contract  lawsuit
     pending against us.

         An improper  assignment of a third-party  finance  Company  installment
         contract  lawsuit was filed  against us and  others.  If our efforts to
         dismiss or favorably resolve this suit fails, we could incur additional
         and  significant  litigation  costs  and  experience  a  drain  on  the
         remaining  Company  resources and value of the remaining  non-operating
         public  shell,  or be a cause for a potential  merger  candidate not to

o    The Asset  Purchase  Agreement  with  Miller has  exposed us to  contingent
     liabilities.

         Under the terms of the Asset Purchase  Agreement  with Miller,  we have

         of our representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Asset
         Purchase Agreement.

o    Our  affiliates  and their  transferees  may not be able to sell our common
     stock  as a  result  of the  Asset  Sale,  unless  we  file a  registration
     statement, which we are not required to do.

         In general,  our affiliates and their  transferees could sell shares of
         our common stock pursuant to SEC Rule 144. However,  as a result of the
         Asset Sale, we may be considered a "blank check  company" and therefore
         subject, along with our affiliates and their transferees, to additional
         restrictions   with   respect  to  the  sale  of  our   common   stock.
         Specifically,  the SEC takes the  position  that  affiliates  and their
         transferees will generally not be able to rely on Rule 144 for resale's
         and will only be able to transfer  securities  pursuant to an effective
         registration  statement  filed under the Securities Act of 1933. We are
         not  obligated  to file a  registration  statement  and  therefore  our
         affiliates and their transferees may not be able to resell their common
         stock following the Asset Sale.

o    Our  stock is quoted on the OTC  Bulletin  Board,  which may make the stock
     more difficult to sell.

         We no longer satisfy the criteria for continued quotation on The Nasdaq
         SmallCap  Market.  Our stock is,  instead,  quoted on the OTC  Bulletin
         Board.  As a result,  our  shareholders  may find it more  difficult to
         dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of,
         our  common  stock,  and the  market  price  for our  common  stock may
         decline.  Trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of
         Rule 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under
         this  rule,  broker/dealers  who  recommend  low-priced  securities  to
         persons other than established  customers and accredited investors must
         satisfy  special sales practice  requirements,  including a requirement
         that they make an individualized written suitability  determination for
         the purchaser and receive the purchaser's  written consent prior to the
         transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform
         Act of 1990 also requires additional  disclosure in connection with any
         trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock (generally any equity
         security  not  traded on an  exchange  or  quoted on Nasdaq  that has a
         market  price  of  less  than  $5.00  per  share,  subject  to  certain
         exceptions),   including  the  delivery,   prior  to  any  penny  stock
         transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market
         and  the  risks   associated   with  the  penny  stock  market.   These
         requirements  could severely  limit the market  liquidity of our common
         stock and the ability of our  shareholders  to dispose of their shares,
         particularly in a declining market.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
          ----------------------------------------------------------

     Market risk is the  exposure  to loss  resulting  from  changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates,  commodity prices and equity prices. The
primary market risk to which the Company is exposed is interest rates.

     The Company's  exposure to changes in interest rates is minimal,  as all of
the Company's long-term debt is fixed rate.


ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
          ------------------------------------------

     Reference  is  made to the  financial  statements  and  related  notes  and
supplemental data under Item 15 filed with this report.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
         -----------------------

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     As of December 31, 2004, the Company  carried out an evaluation,  under the
supervision and with the  participation of the Company's  management,  including
the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial Officer,
of the  effectiveness  of the design and operation of the  Company's  disclosure
controls and procedures.  Based on the evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information  required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,  summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

     There has been no change in the Company's  internal  control over financial
reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2004 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.


ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION
         -----------------

     None.

Audit Committee Financial Expert

     Under rules adopted by the SEC, the Company is required to disclose whether
it has an "Audit  Committee  Financial  Expert" serving on its Audit  Committee.
Although  management  believes  that at least one member of the Audit  Committee
would qualify as an Audit  Committee  Financial  Expert,  the Company's Board of
Directors has not designated any particular member of the Audit Committee as the
Audit Committee Financial Expert under the SEC's rules. Management believes that
at least one  member of the Audit  Committee  is capable  of: (i)  understanding
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  financial   statements;   (ii)
assessing  the general  application  these  principles  in  connection  with the
accounting for estimates,  accruals and reserves; (iii) analyzing and evaluating
the Company's  consolidated  financial statements;  (iv) understanding  internal
control  over  financial  reporting;   and  (v)  understanding  audit  committee
functions.  All directors  serving on the Audit Committee are  "independent"  as
defined in the NASD Marketplace Rule 4200(a)15. During 2004, the Audit Committee
held two meetings.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH

     The  following  performance  graph  compares  cumulative  total  return for
Company  stockholders  over the past five years  against  the  cumulative  total
return of the  Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock  Index,  and against  the  Standard &amp;
Poor's  Machinery Group Index.  (The Company,  since it had eleven months of its
operations as an equipment  manufacturing  concern, felt the S&amp;P Machinery Group
Index was the best available  peer group index to use for comparison  purposes.)
The graph  assumes  $100 is invested in Company  stock and each of the other two
indices at the closing  market  quotation on December 31, 1999 and dividends are
reinvested.  The stock price  performance  shown on the graph is not necessarily
indicative of future price performance.

     Although the companies  included in the Standard &amp; Poor's  Machinery  Group
Index  generally  have a larger market  capitalization  than the Company and its
former  operations,  such  companies  were  believed to provide the closest peer
group  representation  with  respect  to the  industry  formerly  served  by the
Company.

into any filing by the  Company  under  either the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as
amended,  or the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as amended,  except to the
extent that the Company specifically incorporates the same by reference.

BOARD COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     The  underlying  objectives of the Company's  compensation  strategy are to
attract  and  retain the best  possible  executive  talent,  to  motivate  those
executives to achieve optimum  operating  performance  for the Company,  to link
executive and stockholder  interests through equity-based plans and to provide a
compensation package that recognizes individual contributions as well as overall
business  results.  There  are  three  components  to  the  Company's  executive
compensation:  base salary,  long-term  incentives in the form of stock options,
and incentive (bonus) payments.  The incentive (bonus) payments are only paid in
the event the Company is  profitable  as they are based on a  percentage  of net
income.

Base Salary.  Base salary for each  executive  officer,  other than for Larry R.
Inman,  was  subjectively  determined  by an  assessment of his or her sustained
performance,  advancement  potential,  experience,   responsibility,  scope  and
complexity of the position,  and current salary in relation to salary levels for
comparable  positions in the industry,  based on the Company's general awareness
of such salary levels.

Long-Term  Incentives.  Stock  options  are  periodically  granted  to the Chief
Executive  Officer and other executive  officers to encourage  management of the
Company from the perspective of an owner with an equity interest in the Company.
Vesting is used to  encourage  key  employees  to  continue in the employ of the
Company.

Annual Incentives. The Company's executive officers receive an annual bonus from
the Company under their employment agreements. There were no bonus payments made
in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

Chief  Executive  Officer.  Prior to his  resignation  on December 1, 2004,  Mr.
Schoville's  compensation  was  based  on his  employment  arrangement  with the
Company,  which provided for a base salary and had a bonus  provision of 2.5% of
the net income of the Company.  Since the Company was not  profitable  for 2004,
there was no bonus paid to Mr. Schoville.  Mr.  Schoville's  compensation as set
forth in his employment  arrangement  was derived from the value of his industry
expertise and the compensation of comparable  industry  executives.  Mr. Inman's
compensation,  who became CEO upon the resignation of Mr. Schoville, is based on
his employment  contract with the Company,  which provides for a base salary and
has a bonus  provision  of 2.5% of the net  income  of the  Company.  Since  the
Company was not profitable for 2004,  there was no bonus paid to Mr. Inman.  Mr.
Inman's  compensation  as set forth in his employment  contract was derived from
the value of his industry expertise and the compensation of comparable  industry
executives.

The Company does not have any "Excessive  Employee  Remuneration"  as defined in
section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

This report shall not be deemed to be  incorporated by reference into any filing
by the Company  under  either the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended,  or the
Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as  amended,  except to the extent  that the
Company specifically incorporates the same by reference.

                                             Michael W. Foster, Chairman
                                             Roy F. Cunningham

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Of our  current  Board  members,  Mr.  Inman is a salaried  employee of the
Company.  In 2004, Mr. Schuette was a salaried  employee of the Company prior to
his  termination  as a result  of the Asset  Sale.  Board  members  that are not
salaried  employees  of the  Company  receive  separate  compensation  for Board
service. For 2005, that compensation includes:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATTENDANCE FEES:                   $1,000 for each in-person Board meeting
                                   $  500 for each Board committee meeting
                                   Expenses related to attendance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STOCK OPTIONS:                     Per Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Pursuant to the Company's  Non-Employee  Director Stock Option Plan, adopted in
1996, each  non-employee  director receives an initial option to purchase 50,000
shares of the Company's Common Stock, ("Common Stock"),  which vest over a three
year  period at the rate of 40% after  six  months,  40% after two years and 20%
after  three  years.  At each  annual  meeting,  directors  who  have  served  a
three-year  term receive an annual  option to purchase  10,000  shares of Common
Stock  exercisable  six months after the grant date.  The exercise price for the
options granted to  non-employee  directors is equal to the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the date of grant. During 2004 as a result of the Asset Sale
to Miller,  all options  outstanding under this plan were accelerated and became
exercisable  15 days prior to the closing of the Asset Sale or they expired.  No
options were exercised during this  acceleration  period and all 300,000 options
previously  outstanding,  expired and went back into the plan for future use. No
annual  grant  occurred in 2004.  There were no options  outstanding  under this
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan at December 31, 2004.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     The Company has  employment  agreements  with  executive  officers  Messrs.
Inman, and Wallis,  which are  automatically  renewed on a yearly basis,  unless
terminated  by the death or  disability  of the  employee,  or upon at least six
months written  notification by either party. The employment  agreements provide
for base  compensation,  bonus  compensation  and  participation in the employee
benefit  plans  offered by the Company.  Prior to the closing of the Asset Sale,
Mr. Jay and Mrs.  Tucker  previously had employment  agreements with the Company
which were terminated upon the closing of the Asset Sale.

     On April 11, 2000,  the Company  entered into Change of Control  Agreements
with its current and former executive  officers,  Messrs Inman,  Jay, Wallis and
Schuette, and Mrs. Tucker and other key personnel.  These agreements provide for
payments to the executive officer or key employee of the Company,  of one year's
annual base  salary,  and a bonus of $5,000 for each year of Company  service in
excess of five years, in addition to outplacement services and continued Company
employee benefit coverage for a one year period,  in the event that such officer
is terminated  without cause within the period  governed by the agreement.  As a
result of the change of control  from the  closing  of the Asset  Sale,  and the
termination of employment by the Company,  these agreements became effective for
former executive  officers Jay,  Schuette,  and Tucker, and other key personnel,
and pursuant to the terms of the  agreements,  the Company began making payments
under these  agreements.  (See "Item 8. Financial  Statements and  Supplementary
Data.")

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     Lemuel E.  Cunningham,  who is deceased and who served on the  Compensation
Committee of the board of directors of the Company  during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004, was a Vice President of the Company from 1990-1996.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

     Section  16(a) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as amended  (the
"Exchange Act"), requires that the Company's officers,  directors or persons who
own more than 10% of the Common  Stock of the Company  file with the  Securities
and Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") initial reports of beneficial  ownership on
Form 3 and reports of changes in beneficial  ownership of Common Stock and other
equity  securities of the Company on Form 4 and Form 5. Officers,  directors and
holders of more than 10% of the Common Stock are required by SEC  regulations to
furnish to the Company copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file. Based
solely on a review of the copies of such  reports  furnished  to the Company and
written representations with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004,
Mr. Roy F.  Cunningham  filed a late Form 3 to report his initial  holdings upon
becoming a director of the Company.

     The  Company  has not  adopted a Code of  Ethics,  within  the  meaning  of
applicable SEC rules, relating to the conduct of its officers and directors. The
Company  has  identified  the need for a Code of Ethics  but has been  unable to
adopt  one yet  because  of other  management  focus and time  constraints.  The
Company's  board of  directors  is  currently  reviewing  this  requirement  and
anticipates developing a Code of Ethics during 2005.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
          ----------------------------------------------

     On September 30, 2004, the Company redeemed all 174,000 shares of preferred
stock  outstanding owned by the Lemuel E. Cunningham Trust and by members of Mr.
Cunningham's  family.  The Company  maintained life insurance on the life of Mr.
Cunningham in the amount of $1,000,000,  and exchanged the life insurance policy
owned by the Company with a value on September 30, 2004, of $363,633, for all of
the outstanding  shares of the preferred  stock,  with a book value of $696,000.
Current  Director Roy F. Cunningham is the son of Lemuel E.  Cunningham,  who is
deceased.

     The Company  purchased its Tri-Dura(R) rolls from a company owned by Steven
G. Ross "Supplier"  pursuant to a supply  agreement.  Steven G. Ross is a 15.03%
stockholder  in the Company and President of a company  which  competed with the
Company's  Tri-Dura(R)  bags.  The supply  agreement  provided  that the Company
purchase  all of its plastic  rolls,  with  certain  exceptions,  from  Supplier
through at least December 31, 2007.  Thereafter,  either the Company or Supplier
could terminate the supply  agreement upon two years' prior written notice.  The
Company could purchase plastic rolls from other suppliers to the extent Supplier
was unable to supply plastic rolls under the supply agreement. Since the closing
of the Asset Sale, the Company no longer has any  requirements for plastic rolls
under this supply agreement.  On February 9, 2005 in a settlement with supplier,
the supply agreement was terminated. Total purchases from Steven G. Ross for the
years ended  December 31,  2004,  2003,  and 2002,  were in excess of $6 million
annually.

consideration  at its next scheduled  meeting,  or if earlier  consideration  is
required, to the committee chairman.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
AB Holding Group Inc. (fka: Ag-Bag International Limited)


We have audited the  accompanying  balance sheet of AB Holding Group Inc., (fka:
Ag-Bag  International  Limited)  as  of  December  31,  2004,  and  the  related
statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive  loss,  changes in  shareholders'
equity,  and cash flows for the year ended  December 31, 2004.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audit.

We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with  auditing  standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). These standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial  statements.  An audit also  includes  assessing  the  accounting
principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of AB Holding Group Inc., (fka:
Ag-Bag  International  Limited) as of December 31, 2004,  and the results of its
operations  and its  cash  flows  for the  year  ended  December  31,  2004,  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
AB Holding Group Inc. (fka: Ag-Bag International Limited)


We have audited the  accompanying  balance sheet of AB Holding Group Inc., (fka:
Ag-Bag  International  Limited)  as  of  December  31,  2003,  and  the  related
statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive  loss,  changes in  shareholders'
equity,  and cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002.
These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's  management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audits.

We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with  auditing  standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). These standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial  statements.  An audit also  includes  assessing  the  accounting
principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of AB Holding Group Inc., (fka:
Ag-Bag  International  Limited) as of December 31, 2003,  and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, and
2002, in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
Company  would  continue  as a going  concern.  As  discussed  in Note 17 to the
financial statements, the Company had suffered recurring losses from operations,
had an accumulated  deficit,  negative cash flows from operations and was out of
compliance with its bank  covenants,  which raised  substantial  doubt about its
ability to continue  as a going  concern.  Management's  plans  regarding  those
matters are  described in Note 17. The  financial  statements do not include any
adjustments that might have resulted from the outcome of this uncertainty.

AB HOLDING GROUP INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION - AB Holding Group Inc.,  (formerly  known as Ag-Bag  International
Limited) is a Delaware corporation. As a result of the sale on November 30, 2004
of the Company's  operating  assets and equipment to Miller St. Nazianz Inc., of
Wisconsin,  the Company became a non-operating  public company shell without any
operating  activities,  holding  only those  assets not  purchased by Miller St.
Nazianz  Inc.  The  Company  changed  its name back to AB  Holding  Group  Inc.,
effective  December 7, 2004.  Prior to November 30, 2004,  Ag-Bag  International
Limited's primary operations included the manufacturing and sale of machines and
related  bags used in the  agriculture  industry  to store  feed for  livestock,
grain, and other products.  Additionally,  the Company manufactured machines and
bags for composting.  Ag-Bag  International  Limited's  primary market was North
America; however, it sold products worldwide.

The Company is  currently  in the  process of winding  down its  operations  and
selling its remaining assets so the Company can either dissolve and liquidate or
sell the remaining non-operating public shell company to another party by merger
or another method.

The Company's  common stock began trading  publicly on January 17, 1990,  and is
traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol "ABHG".

STATEMENTS  OF CASH FLOWS - For purposes of the  statements  of cash flows,  the
Company  considers all  highly-liquid  investments  with original  maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

The Company transferred $471,937 and $135,490 in 2004 and 2003 respectively from
rental  equipment  to  inventory  held-for-sale.  In 2003 and 2002,  the Company
transferred $183,911, and $331,726,  respectively,  from inventory held-for-sale
to rental equipment.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - Accounts receivable are from distributors and customers of
Ag-Bag  International  Limited's  products  that were sold  prior to the sale to
Miller St. Nazianz, Inc., and from AB Holding Group, Inc. billings to Miller for
subsequent  bills  invoiced to the Company  during the  transition.  The Company
performed periodic credit evaluations of its customers and maintained allowances
for  potential  credit  losses.  Also,  to reduce the risk of credit  loss,  the
Company required  letters of credit from foreign  customers with which no credit
history had been established.

The  non-operating  public  company  shell  continues  to collect its  remaining
receivables  through  Company  personnel,  and  through  the use of third  party
collection agencies, which the Company has previously used.

                                                           AB HOLDING GROUP INC.
                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
         POLICIES - (continued)

Receivables are presented at the aggregate unpaid principle balance amounts, net
of an allowance for doubtful  accounts.  The allowance for doubtful  accounts is
established  through a provision for bad debts expense.  Receivables are charged
against the allowance for bad debt when management  believes the  collectibility
of an account is unlikely.  The allowance is an amount that management  believes
will be adequate to absorb future losses on existing receivables that may become
uncollectible based upon overall receivable quality,  review of specific problem
accounts,  current economic  conditions,  and prior charge-off  experience.  The
uncollectible  portion of a customer's  unpaid principle  balance is charged-off
after  the  Company   initiates  the  collection   process,   investigates   the
circumstances  of  the  past-due  balance,   and  determines  an  amount  to  be
uncollectible.   Generally,   the  Company  considers  receivables  from  import
shipments  past due after 15 days;  export and air  freight  shipments  past due
after 30 days;  and shipments  utilizing a foreign agent past due after 60 days.
The Company  accrues  interest  on past-due  accounts  and  continues  to accrue
interest until the Company considers the receivable uncollectible.

INVENTORIES  -  Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower of cost or  market  (net
realizable value). The Company determines cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
basis. The Company's estimates of market value incorporate projections of future
sales  volume  by  product  class.  In  estimating  the  market  value  of parts
inventory,  the Company reviewed  current  inventory levels in relation to sales
forecasts  and adjusted the  valuation  reserve  accordingly.  For the remaining
categories of inventory,  the Company established a reserve balance based on the
aging of the specific inventory items.

PROPERTY,  PLANT,  AND  EQUIPMENT  -  Property,  plant and  equipment  have been
reclassified  to held for sale assets as of December 31, 2004,  and are recorded
at the lower of cost or market.  Previously,  property, plant, and equipment was
stated at cost and depreciated on the straight-line  method over their estimated
useful  lives which ranged from 5 to 7 years for  equipment,  and 20 to 30 years
for buildings.

Expenditures for additions and major improvements were capitalized. Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

INTANGIBLE  ASSETS - Intangible  assets  consisted of licenses and patents.  The
cost of the licenses and patents were  amortized over the lesser of the terms of
the related  agreement or the estimated  useful lives of the  respective  asset,
ranging from 7 to 12 years.

THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS - The Company previously assigned some of its
trade accounts  receivable to various former third-party  financing sources with
discount  rates  ranging from .75% to 1.58% at December  31, 2004.  The accounts
could be assigned  with or without  recourse  depending on the specific  account
being  assigned.  Effective  September 30, 2004, the Company no longer  accepted
accounts to be assigned  with  recourse.  At December 31,  2004,  the balance of
previously assigned accounts with recourse was $377,465. Management has reviewed
the remaining  accounts with recourse at December 31, 2004, and determined  that
no accrual is necessary for potential  future recourse  obligations.  At January
31,  2005,  the  balance of  previously  assigned  accounts  with  recourse  had
decreased to $315,585,  as customers  made their  regular  payments to the third
party finance company.

                                                                             F-9

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
         POLICIES - (continued)

PRE-SEASON  ORDER  FLOORING - During 2002,  the Company  implemented  its former
Pre-Season Order Program under which the Company paid the flooring  interest for
its former dealers who made purchases from the Company under specific provisions
of the Pre-Season Order Program.  The Company estimated their future obligations
under this  former  program at the time of sale,  reduced  sales  revenues,  and
accrued a liability for the estimated future interest  obligation.  This program
and the  Company's  obligation  for interest  ceased with the sale to Miller St.
Nazianz, Inc. on November 30, 2004. Total dealer flooring interest was $109,851,
$344,870,  and $113,534 for the years ended  December 31, 2004,  2003, and 2002,
respectively.

VOLUME DISCOUNTS - Under the same former  Pre-Season Order Program,  the Company
paid volume  discounts to its former  dealers based upon a sliding scale for the
volume of orders placed by, and shipped to dealers.  The Company estimated their
future  obligations under this former program at the time of sale, reduced sales
revenues,  and accrued a liability  for the  estimated  future  volume  discount
obligation.  This program  ceased with the sale to Miller St.  Nazianz,  Inc. on
November 30, 2004. Total volume  discounts were $567,606,  $732,458 and $182,765
for years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - Prior to the sale to Miller St. Nazianz, Inc., on November
30, 2004,  revenue was recognized  when the customer had placed an order for the
product,  the product was delivered or shipped to the customer,  the sales price
had been determined, and collection was reasonably assured. The Company included
revenues  earned on shipping costs billed to customers in "Net Sales," and costs
to ship  products  were  included in "Cost of Sales." Since the Company sold its
operating  assets on November 30, 2004, it no longer has any source of operating
revenue.

ADVERTISING  COSTS  - The  Company  expensed  advertising  costs  as  they  were
incurred.  Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and
2002 were $221,603, $412,047, and $504,060, respectively.

WARRANTY  RESERVE - Prior to the sale to Miller St.  Nazianz,  Inc., on November
30, 2004, at the time of sale, the Company accrued a liability for the estimated
future costs to be incurred under the provisions of its warranty agreements. The
Company  reviewed its  historical  warranty  expense and current sales trends in
products covered under warranty, and adjusted its warranty reserves accordingly.
Warranty  activity  for the  years  ended  December  31,  2004,  and 2003 was as
follows:

                                                2004                2003
                                          -----------------   -----------------

Warranty costs incurred during the year           (125,136)           (195,961)

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
         POLICIES - (continued)

STOCK  OPTION  PLAN - The  Company  applies  Accounting  Principles  Board (APB)
Opinion  No.  25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued  to  Employees,"  and  related
interpretations   in  accounting   for  its  stock  option  plan.   Accordingly,
compensation  expense  related to grants to  employees  would be recorded on the
date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying  stock exceeded
the exercise price.  Had  compensation  cost for the Company's stock option plan
been  determined  based upon the fair  value at grant date for awards  under the
plan consistent with the methodology  prescribed under the Financial  Accounting
Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation," additional compensation expense
would have been recognized.

The Company has computed,  for pro forma disclosure  purposes,  the value of all
options  granted during 2003 and 2002 using the  Black-Scholes  pricing model as
prescribed  under  SFAS No.  123.  There were no  options  granted in 2004.  The
following  assumptions were made for grants in 2003 and 2002: risk-free interest
rate of  2.94%  and  4.41%,  respectively,  expected  life of seven  years,  and
dividend  rates  of 0%.  For 2003 and  2002  the  expected  volatility  over the
expected lives of the grants was assumed to be 102.52% and 77.04%, respectively.
The weighted-average  fair value of the options granted was estimated to be $.34
in 2003 and $.20 in 2002.

If the Company had  accounted for the value of the options  granted  during 2003
and  2002,  in  accordance  with  SFAS No.  123,  the  Company's  net loss  from
discontinued  operations  would  have been  increased  to the pro forma  amounts
indicated below:



                                                   2004                    2003                    2002
                                            -------------------      ------------------      -----------------

Net loss from discontinued operations:
        As reported                         $       (4,313,027)      $      (2,753,715)      $       (663,988)
        Pro forma                           $       (4,313,027)      $      (2,766,083)      $       (673,278)

Net loss from discontinued
  operations per share:
        As reported                         $            (0.36)      $           (0.24)      $          (0.06)
        Pro forma                           $            (0.36)      $           (0.24)      $          (0.06)



The resulting pro forma  compensation  costs may not be  representative  of that
expected in future years.

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE - Basic net income per share is calculated using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Preferred
stock dividends were considered in the  computation.  The calculation of diluted
net income per share  excludes the effect of potentially  dilutive  common stock
equivalents  because  their impact,  when  calculated  using the treasury  stock
method,  is antidilutive.  The potentially  antidilutive  shares at December 31,
2004 and 2003, were 1,257 and 6,437 respectively.

                                                                            F-11

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
         POLICIES - (continued)

INCOME  TAXES - The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  under  the asset and
liability  method.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized for the
future tax  consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial
statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their
respective  tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are measured using
enacted  tax rates  expected  to apply to  taxable  income in the years in which
those temporary  differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Valuation
allowances are  established to reduce  potential  deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that all or some portion of  potential  deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $3,045,000 and $1,577,772 as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Management has established a valuation
allowance of $3,045,000  and  $1,577,772  against  these  deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

SEGMENT INFORMATION -the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related  Information,"  which  establishes  annual and interim
reporting   standards  for  an  enterprise's   operating  segments  and  related
disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas, and major customers.
The Company has  analyzed  the  reporting  requirements  of the standard and has
determined that its operations were within a single operating segment.

DISCLOSURE  OF FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  - The  carrying  amounts of
financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable,
and accounts payable  approximated  fair value as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
because of the  relatively  short  maturity of these  instruments.  The carrying
value of notes payable approximated fair value as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
based upon interest rates and terms available for the same or similar loans.

MANAGEMENT  ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial  statements,  in conformity
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Significant  estimates used in preparing these financial  statements
included  allowances for doubtful accounts  receivable,  inventory  obsolescence
reserves,  depreciation  methods for property,  plant and  equipment,  valuation
allowance for held for sale assets, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets
and reserves for recourse  obligations,  warranty  obligations,  and  Pre-Season
Order flooring interest obligations.

RECENTLY  ISSUED  ACCOUNTING   STANDARDS  -  In  December  2004,  the  Financial
Accounting   Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued  SFAS  No.  153,  "Exchanges  of
Non-monetary  Assets,  an  Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29." The guidance in APB
Opinion No. 29,  "Accounting  for  Non-monetary  Transactions,"  is based on the
principle that exchanges of non-monetary  assets should be measured based on the
fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, however,
included certain  exceptions to that principle.  SFAS No. 153 amends APB Opinion
No.  29 to  eliminate  the  exception  for  non-monetary  exchanges  of  similar
productive  assets and  replaces it with a general  exception  for  exchanges of
non-monetary  assets  that do not  have  commercial  substance.  A  non-monetary
exchange  has  commercial  substance  if the future cash flows of the entity are
expected to change  significantly  as a result of the exchange.  SFAS No. 153 is
effective for  non-monetary  asset  exchanges in fiscal periods  beginning after
June 15, 2005.  The  implementation  of this statement is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In December  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R (revised  2004),  "Share-Based
Payment,"  which is a revision  of SFAS No.  123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation."  SFAS No. 123R  supersedes  APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for
Stock Issued to Employees,"  and amends SFAS No. 95,  "Statement of Cash Flows."
Generally,  the approach in Statement 123R is similar to the approach  described
in SFAS 123, however,  SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including  grants of employee  stock  options,  to be  recognized  in the income
statement based on their fair values.  Pro forma  disclosures  seen in Note 2 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Accounting Principles - Stock
Option Plans," will no longer be an alternative.  SFAS No. 123R is effective for
interim  periods  beginning  after June 15,  2005.  The  implementation  of this
statement is not expected to have a material  impact on the Company's  financial
statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  "Inventory  Costs, an Amendment
of ARB No. 43,  Chapter  4." SFAS No.  151 amends ARB 43,  Chapter 4, to clarify
that the abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,  freight, handling costs and
wasted  materials  (spoilage) be recognized as current period  charges.  It also
requires  that  allocation  of  fixed  production  overheads  to  the  costs  of
conversion be based on the normal  capacity of the production  facilities.  SFAS
No. 151 is effective for inventory  costs incurred during fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005.  The  implementation  of this  statement is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In June 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,  "Accounting  for Certain  Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." This statement
establishes  standards  regarding  classification  and  measurement  of  certain
financial  instruments with  characteristics  of both liabilities and equity. It
requires  financial  instruments  within  the  scope  of  this  statement  to be
classified as  liabilities  (or an asset in some  circumstances).  Many of these
financial  instruments were previously  classified as equity.  This statement is
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003,
and was  otherwise  effective  at the  beginning  of the  first  interim  period
beginning after June 15, 2003. For financial instruments

                                                                            F-13

created  before the issuance date of this  statement  and still  existing at the
beginning of the interim period of adoption, transition is achieved by reporting
the  cumulative  effect  of a change in an  accounting  principle  by  initially
measuring the financial  instruments at fair value. The  implementation  of this
statement did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In April 2003,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,  "Amendment  of  Statement  133 on
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  This  statement  amends and
clarifies  financial  accounting  and  reporting  for  derivative   instruments,
including  certain  derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts and for
hedging  activities under SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities."  The  implementation  of this statement did not have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),  "Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,  "Consolidated  Financial  Statements," and
requires existing  unconsolidated  variable interest entities to be consolidated
by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks
among parties involved.  This  interpretation  explains how to identify variable
interest  entities and how an  enterprise  assesses its  interests in a variable
interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity.  In December 2003,
FASB made revisions and delayed  implementation of certain provisions of FIN 46.
As a public  entity that is not a "Small  Business  Issuer,"  the Company is now
required to apply FIN 46 to all  unconsolidated  variable  interest  entities no
later than March 31, 2004, with the exception of unconsolidated  special-purpose
entities,   which  had  an   implementation   deadline  of  December  31,  2003.
Special-purpose  entities for this  provision  are expected to include  entities
whose  activities  are primarily  related to  securitizations  or other forms of
asset-backed  financings or single-lessee leasing arrangements.  The Company was
associated with a potential  variable  interest entity through its investment in
BAW,  prior to its  sale in April  2004.  Management  determined  that BAW was a
variable  interest  entity,  but concluded  that the Company was not the primary
beneficiary.

RECLASSIFICATIONS  -  Certain  reclassifications  have  been  made  to the  2003
financial statements to conform with the 2004 presentation.

NOTE 2 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On August 13, 2004, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell
substantially all of the Company's operating assets to Miller St. Nazianz, Inc.,
a Wisconsin  corporation  who will integrate the operations of Ag-Bag into their
current farm equipment manufacturing business operations.  On November 30, 2004,
the Company's  shareholders  approved the transaction and the Company closed the
Asset Purchase  Agreement dated August 13, 2004.  Upon the closing,  Ag-Bag sold
Miller  substantially  all of our operating assets  (inventory,  equipment,  and
patents),  and Miller  assumed  certain  liabilities  relating to the  purchased
assets and the operations of our business arising after the closing.  Certain of
our assets were excluded.  Miller assumed liabilities  relating to the purchased
assets  and  business  that  arose  after  the  closing,  and  paid us net  cash
consideration in the amount of $6,427,889.

The following schedule outlines the components of the asset sale to Miller:

        Inventory                                      $ 4,926,889
        Fixed assets                                     1,276,000
        Intangible assets                                  300,000
                                                      -------------
          Subtotal                                       6,502,889
        Less: Warranty                                     (75,000)
                                                      -------------
        Net Proceeds                                   $ 6,427,889
                                                      =============

As a result of the sale to Miller St. Nazianz Inc., the Company  terminated most
of its employees,  paid termination  benefits and began making payments pursuant
to change of control agreements, during the fourth quarter of 2004.

On April 11, 2000, the Company  entered into Change of Control  Agreements  with
its  current  and former  executive  officers,  Messrs  Inman,  Jay,  Wallis and
Schuette,  and Mrs.  Tucker and key  personnel.  These  agreements  provide  for
payments to the executive officer or key employee of the Company,  of one year's
annual base  salary,  and a bonus of $5,000 for each year of Company  service in
excess of five years, in addition to outplacement services and continued Company
employee benefit coverage for a one year period,  in the event that such officer
is terminated  without cause within the period  governed by the agreement.  As a
result of the  change of control  from the  closing of the asset sale to Miller,
and the  termination  of  employment  by the Company,  these  agreements  became
effective for former  executive  officers  Jay,  Schuette,  and Tucker,  and key
personnel.

The total  number of  employees  terminated  pursuant  to the sale to Miller St.
Nazianz Inc.,  which  consisted of office,  customer  service and  manufacturing
personnel was 66 through December 31, 2004. The Company currently estimates that
4-5  employees  will remain to run the limited  operations  and wind-down of the
Company and that those  employees will be terminated as their jobs are completed
or upon the final distribution and liquidation of the Company.

                                                                            F-15

NOTE 10 -  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

TREASURY  STOCK - During 2001,  the Company  repurchased  105,000  shares of its
common stock from a retiring director for $31,500.

PREFERRED  STOCK - During 2004,  the Company  redeemed all 174,000 shares of the
preferred stock outstanding.  The Company maintained life insurance on the owner
of the  preferred  stock and exchanged  the life  insurance  policy owned by the
Company,  valued at $363,633, for all of the outstanding shares of the preferred
stock, with a book value of $696,000.

STOCK  AWARDS - The  Company has a 1991  Employee  Stock Plan (the Plan) and has
reserved 133,575 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan. Under terms
of the Plan,  stock is awarded to employees at the sole  discretion of the Board
of Directors. No awards were granted under the Plan for 2004, 2003, and 2002. At
December  31,  2004,  there were 125,335  shares  available  for grant under the
Employee Stock Plan.

COMMON  STOCK  OPTIONS - The Company  has an  Incentive  Stock  Option Plan (the
Incentive  Plan) and has  reserved  185,000  shares of common stock for issuance
under the  Incentive  Plan.  Options  under the  Incentive  Plan are issuable to
officers  and  employees  of the  Company  and all option  grants will be at the
market  value of the stock at the date of grant.  Vesting  of stock  options  is
determined for each grant by the Board of Directors.  During 2004, there were no
options  granted  by the  Company,  20,000  shares  were  exercised  and  10,000
unexercised  options  went back into the plan for future use.  At  December  31,
2004,  there were 145,000 shares  available for grant under the Incentive  Stock
Option Plan.

During 1996, the Company adopted a Non-Employee  Director Stock Option Plan (the
Director  Plan) and has reserved  1,000,000  shares of common stock for issuance
under the Director  Plan. The Director Plan grants 50,000 options to each member
of the Board of Directors  who is not an employee of the Company.  Forty percent
of the 50,000  options  vest and become  exercisable  six months after the grant
date, another 40% of the options vest and become exercisable two years after the
grant date, and the remaining portion of the options vest and become exercisable
three  years after the grant date.  Beginning  with the annual  meeting in 2000,
those directors who have served a three-year period,  receive an annual grant of
10,000 options which become  exercisable six months after the grant date. During
2004 as a result of the sale to Miller St. Nazianz Inc., all options outstanding
under this plan were  accelerated  and became  exercisable  15 days prior to the
close of the sale to Miller or they expired.  No options were  exercised  during
this acceleration period and 300,000 options previously outstanding, expired and
went back into the plan for future use.  No annual  grant  occurred in 2004.  At
December 31, 2004,  there were  1,000,000  shares  available for grant under the
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan.

NOTE 12 - BAW JOINT VENTURE

On February 27, 1997, the Company entered into a Joint Venture  Agreement (Joint
Venture)   with   Budissa   Agroservice    Gesellschaft   and   formed   Budissa
Agrodienstleistungen und Warenhandels (BAW). On April 27, 2004, the Company sold
its  investment  in the BAW  Joint  Venture  (Budissa  Agrodienstleistungen  Und
Warenhandels)  to its  former  German  dealer,  BAG  (Budissa  Agroservice)  for
$500,000 in cash,  payable 30 days from  closing,  to provide  the Company  with
working capital.  BAW had no operating income during the period ending April 27,
2004. The Company received the $500,000 on May 26, 2004. The Company  recognized
$36,562 as an extraordinary gain from this sale. Prior to this date, the Company
had a 50% interest in BAW which was accounted for under the equity  method.  BAW
folds and distributes silage bags throughout  Europe. The Company's  accumulated
deficit was reduced by  undistributed  equity earnings from BAW in the amount of
$441,229 as of December 31, 2003.



                                                                                  2004                    2003

On February 27, 1997,  BAW also entered into a lease  agreement with the Company
for the use of a folding  machine.  Royalties  were earned by the Company  based
upon the  poundage  folded by BAW.  In 2003,  2002,  and 2001,  income from this
agreement was $200,000, $190,000 and $168,000,  respectively.  On June 30, 2003,
the  Company  sold the  depreciated  folding  machine to the Joint  Venture  for
$400,000,  which terminated this folding lease agreement. The sale resulted in a
gain of $345,836,  of which  $172,918 was deferred.  The deferred gain was being
recognized  over the  estimated  useful  life of the  asset on BAW's  books.  At
December 31, 2004, the remaining  deferred gain was $ -0-, as the investment was
sold in 2004.

On December 18, 2000,  the Company  entered into an agreement with Dresdner Bank
to  guarantee up to 511,292 Euro  ($535,987  USD) as security for an  additional
cash credit  facility of BAW. On August 5, 2003,  the  guarantee  was reduced by
Dresdner Bank to 250,000 Euro ($312,500  USD). Upon the sale of BAW in 2004, the
Company was relieved of its  guarantee  with  Dresdner  Bank.  There was no Euro
outstanding  under this  additional  cash credit  facility at December 31, 2003.
Upon  modification of the agreement during 2003,  management  estimated the fair
value of the  guarantee  to be $15,000.  The  Company had  recorded an accrued a
liability of $15,000 at December 31, 2003, which was relieved upon  cancellation
of the guarantee in 2004.


                                                                            F-29

NOTE 13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

PURCHASE  COMMITMENTS  - The  Company  purchased  its  Tri-Dura(R)  rolls from a
company  owned by Steven  G. Ross  (Supplier)  pursuant  to a supply  agreement.
Steven G. Ross is a 15.03% stockholder in the Company and President of a company
which  competed  with the  Company's  Tri-Dura(R)  bags.  The  supply  agreement
provided  that the Company  purchase  all of its  plastic  rolls,  with  certain
exceptions, from Supplier through at least December 31, 2007. Thereafter, either
the Company or Supplier  could  terminate the supply  agreement  upon two years'
prior  written  notice.  The Company  could  purchase  plastic  rolls from other
suppliers to the extent  Supplier was unable to supply  plastic  rolls under the
supply agreement. Since the Company's sale of its operating assets and equipment
to Miller St.  Nazianz  Inc.,  the  Company no longer had any  requirements  for
plastic  rolls under this supply  agreement.  On February 9, 2005 in  settlement
with supplier, the supply agreement was terminated.  Total purchases from Steven
G. Ross for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, were in excess of
$6 million annually.

LEASE  COMMITMENTS - The Company  leases land under a  noncancellable  operating
lease. This lease requires monthly payments with terms that expire through 2014.
Total rent expense under all operating  leases for the years ended  December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, totaled $20,496, $60,036 and $66,361, respectively.

Future  minimum lease  payments  under  noncancellable  operating  leases are as
follows:

Years ending December 31,         2005                             $ 20,496

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE 13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - (continued)

REAL ESTATE LISTING  COMMITMENT - The Company entered into a Commercial  Brokers
Association  exclusive  sale  listing  agreement  in 2004  for  the  sale of its
Warrenton, Oregon property. The agreement provides for a 5% brokerage commission
to be paid based upon the gross  sales  price of the  property.  This  exclusive
listing  agreement  expires on June 30, 2005, with a six-month tail on brokerage
commission if the property is subsequently  sold to a party contacted during the
engagement.  Any commission  earned on this  commitment  will be paid out of the
proceeds of the sale.

CONTINGENCIES  - The Company is involved in  litigation  matters that are in the
normal course of business.  Management is of the opinion that these matters will
not  have  a  material  effect  on  the   accompanying   financial   statements.
Accordingly,  no  provision  for these  matters  is  included  in the  financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2004.


NOTE 14 - CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

Financial  instruments  which  potentially  subject  the  Company to credit risk
consist of cash and receivables.  The Company's cash balances are with federally
insured banks and  periodically  exceed insured limits.  The Company's  invested
cash  balances are with Wells Fargo  Brokerage  Services,  LLC, in floating rate
money market and par municipal general obligation bonds, which are not federally
insured.

The Company has  outstanding  accounts  receivable  balances  with two customers
totaling  approximately  $604,790 at December 31, 2004. These balances represent
78% of the  accounts  receivable  balance at December  31, 2004 and were largely
comprised of amounts owing from the sale to Miller St. Nazianz, Inc.


NOTE 15 - 401(K) PROFIT SHARING PLAN

The Company has a qualified  401(k)  profit  sharing plan covering all full-time
personnel with at least one year of continuous service.  Employer  contributions
to the plan are at the discretion of the Company's management.  No contributions
were made by the Company to the 401(k) profit  sharing plan in 2004 or 2003. The
Company's  eligible  employees  made  contributions  to the plan of $147,607 and
$196,292  for the years  ended  December  31, 2004 and 2003  respectively.  As a
result  of the  sale to  Miller  St.  Nazianz  Inc.,  and the  ensuing  employee
terminations,  the  Company's  401(k) plan  incurred a partial plan  termination
during 2004.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 17 - 2003 GOING CONCERN

The Company incurred net losses of $2,753,715, $663,988, and $164,150 during the
years ended December 31, 2001-2003, and had an accumulated deficit of $3,696,569
at December 31, 2003.  The Company also had negative cash flows from  operations
of  $1,341,605  for the year ended  December  31,  2003.  The Company was out of
compliance with their net worth and earnings  covenants under the line of credit
agreement with their primary lender, Wells Fargo Business Credit.

Management  believed their recent weak  operating  results were primarily due to
depressed milk prices in the agricultural  sector,  which had a direct impact on
the disposable income of their dairy farmer customers. Management estimated that
over 75% of their end users were dairy farmers.  Management  believed that dairy
farmers  were  delaying  or  eliminating  capital   expenditures  due  to  their
uncertainties  regarding  milk prices and their  disposable  income.  Management
further   believed   that  early   predictions   for  2004  showed  milk  prices
significantly  higher  than the  historically  low  levels  seen for much of the
previous years and expected  operating results to improve as dairy farmers began
to see increases in their  disposable  income through  stabilizing  milk prices.
Management  also felt that its dealers  were  conservative  on their  pre-season
orders for 2003-04 as a result of the prolonged, depressed milk price situation.
It was  managements  feeling  that some of its  dealers  would  have the need to
re-order  additional  product  during  the  year as a result  of the  forecasted
improving  milk  price,  which  would  help  them  sell out of  their  remaining
inventories  currently  in their dealer  stock.  If this  happened,  there was a
potential  for higher  gross  margins for the  Company,  as the dealer  would be
re-ordering  outside of the pre-season  order program terms which provided for a
lower  volume  discount  on  their  re-orders.   In  addition,   management  had
implemented an expense reduction plan. Specifically,  management had implemented
staff reductions and reduced salaries of senior management. Nonessential capital
expenditures,  travel and other  expenses  were either  eliminated or postponed.
Management had also been considering  other changes to their business model such
as opportunities to sell the business,  refinance its Warrenton, Oregon facility
(which had only a small  economic  development  loan  outstanding  against  this
collateral),  consolidate  or  dispose  of  manufacturing  facilities,  or other
tangible or intangible  assets,  including selling the Company's 50% interest in
its joint venture, or take out a policy loan against the life insurance policies
that were in force in which the Company was the beneficiary, to provide positive
cash flows to the Company.

Because it was unclear whether the Company would be successful in  accomplishing
these objectives,  there was uncertainty about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern.  The financial  statements  did not include any  adjustments
that might be  necessary  should the  Company be unable to  continue  as a going
concern.
