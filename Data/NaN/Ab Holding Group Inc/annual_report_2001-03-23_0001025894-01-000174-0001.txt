Item 1.  Business
-----------------

General
-------

     Ag-Bag International Limited (the "Company") was incorporated as a New York
corporation  in 1989.  The primary  operating  company,  Ag-Bag  Corporation,  a
Nebraska corporation,  was incorporated in 1978. The Company changed its name in
1990 from AB Holding Group, Inc. to Ag-Bag International Limited. In 1994, in an
effort to  streamline  and save  administrative  expenses,  two of the Company's
operating  subsidiaries,  A.B. Rental,  Inc. and Ag-Bag  Corporation were merged
into the  Delaware  subsidiary,  ABVIN  Merging  Corp.  On January 1, 1995,  the
Company was merged into its Delaware subsidiary resulting in the reincorporation
of the  Company  in  Delaware  and a change in its name to Ag-Bag  International
Limited.

     The  Company  has  pioneered  an  alternate  method  of  storing  feed  for
livestock.  Traditional  methods of  storing  feed have  included  placing it in
bunkers,  pits, and silos or baling and stacking it. The Company's  method is to
store the feed in huge  plastic  bags of up to 500 feet in  length  and up to 12
feet in  diameter  by  tightly  stuffing  the feed  into the  bag.  The  Company
assembles  the machines  for  stuffing  the feed into the bags.  It has the bags
manufactured  to its  specifications  and then  folds and  distributes  the bags
through its dealer  network.  The benefits of bagging the feed  include  reduced
cost,  additional  flexibility in harvesting and storing the feed, enhanced feed
quality,  and  relatively  small  capital  requirements.  The Company also sells
ancillary  products that complement the Company's main line of bagging  machines
and bags.

     The  following  table  identifies  the revenue  from each product line that
accounted for more than 15% of total revenue over the last three years:

         Product             1998      1999      2000
         ---------           ----      ----      ----
         Bags                52%       52%       53%
         Machines            38%       41%       39%
         Other               10%        7%        8%
                             ---       ----      ----
         Net Sales           100%      100%      100%

     The  Company  expects  the use of bagging  as a means of silage  storage to
continue  to play a major role in the future  because the quality of stored feed
is better  than other known  competitive  methods,  allowing  farmers to be more
efficient and to produce dairy,  beef, sheep and pork products at a lower price.
The Company  believes the concept of bagging is one way in which  farmers can be
more profitable by reducing, or completely eliminating, the purchase of feed and
grain from outside sources.  Bagging enables the farmer to produce and store the
feed on the farm and provides easier access to the silage,  thereby allowing the
farmer to choose  the  quality of silage to feed at any given  time.  The bagged
feed has shown high quality, allowing for higher production.

     The Company  expanded its operations into Europe in 1989 where it offered a
custom bagging service on a fee per metric tonne basis in the United Kingdom. In
1997, the Company's Board of Directors  approved a strategic  realignment of the
Company.  The  realignment  involved the sale of the  Company's
                                       2
<PAGE>
United Kingdom  subsidiary,  which had not been performing at a profitable level
due to the continued  escalation of the BSE (Mad Cow) problem within the British
farming industry.

     In 1994,  the Company  shipped its first orders to dealers in Japan,  Latin
America and Germany. The Company continues to sell worldwide in Asia, Australia,
New Zealand, Western and Central Europe and the Caribbean. Export sales from the
Company's  United  States  operations  were 6.5% of net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2000.

     The Company is developing other uses for its bagging  technology.  In 1993,
the  Company  adapted  its bagging  machines  to permit  bagging of  compostable
organic matter in the Company's recyclable Tri-Dura(R) plastic bags. The Company
also has developed  mobile  plastic  recovery  units which enable the Company to
bail and pick up the recyclable Tri-Dura(R) plastic bags from its customers.

Seasonal Nature of Business
---------------------------

     The core  business  of the  Company  is  historically  seasonal  due to the
harvest seasons in North America and Europe. The Company's machinery tends to be
purchased in anticipation  of the next harvest  season,  so most of the sales of
machinery  occur in the spring and summer.  This  requires  the Company to carry
significant  amounts  of  inventory  to  meet  rapid  delivery  requirements  of
customers.  Bag sales  tend to occur as the  harvest  season  approaches  in the
summer,  and during the harvest  season in the fall.  The Company  took steps to
counteract  some of this  seasonality  by  generating  sales  in  Latin  America
beginning in 1994 and in Australia and New Zealand in 1996.

     Approximately 95% of the Company's business is concentrated in the Northern
Hemisphere  resulting in between 65-72% of the Company's revenue being generated
during the  spring  and  summer  (2nd and 3rd  Quarters).  The  following  table
outlines the percentage of revenue over the past three years by quarter:

         Quarter          1998              1999              2000

         2nd              35%               33%               31%
         3rd              35%               39%               34%
         4th              13%               13%               14%


Farm Equipment and Products
---------------------------

     Introduction.  Silage is made using the Ag-Bag(R)  system by storing forage
crops,  such as corn,  sorghum,  or alfalfa,  under anaerobic  (without  oxygen)
conditions in sealed Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags. The traditional  methods
for  making  silage  involve  storing  it  in  bunkers,  pits  or  silos.  Using
traditional methods,  there is a nutrient loss resulting from a reduction in the
moisture  content of the forage  before  storage.  The moisture  content must be
reduced to  compensate  for the high oxygen  content of the forage which results
from the  inability to pack the forage  tightly  enough.  When the forage is not
packed  sufficiently,  the silage  fermentation  process  produces too much heat
resulting  in an even  greater  loss of  nutrient  value than would occur if the
moisture  content were not reduced.  The loss of nutrient  value  results in the
need for additional food supplements or an increased volume of feed.

     The Ag-Bag(R)  system is an  alternative  to bunkers,  pits and silos.  The
Ag-Bag(R)  bagging  machines push the forage into huge  recyclable  plastic film
Tri-Dura(R) bags with sufficient  compaction to minimize the amount of oxygen in
the bag, which is then sealed tightly when filled.  As a result,  the forage can
be stored with significantly  higher moisture content.  The ability to store the
forage in this manner also reduces the time  required to cut,  prepare and store
the forage thus reducing the loss of nutrients and providing higher quality feed
for production within the farmers' herds.

                                       3

     Ag-Bag(R) Farm Equipment. The Company's principal line of farm equipment is
marketed under the trade name  "Ag-Bagger(R)."  The Ag-Bagger(R) is available in
three  versions  with a number of  optional  features.  A wide range of optional
features are offered by the Company on its bagging machines in order to meet the
budget needs of the farmer.

     The smallest  version  consists of machines used to load forage into Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags ranging in size from 8 to 10 feet in diameter and 100
to 200 feet in length. This version was first introduced by the Company in 1987.
It is used primarily in smaller dairy and cattle feeding  operations by dairymen
with herds averaging about 50 head and by cattlemen feeding up to about 300 head
of feeder cattle.  Most of these machines are powered by the power take-off unit
of a farm tractor and moved by a tractor or other farm vehicle. The retail price
for this machine ranges from approximately $23,000 to $45,000.

     In 1992, the Company introduced a medium-sized machine that can be operated
by the power take-off unit of a farm tractor or operated  independently  with an
optional  diesel  engine made by  Caterpillar  or Deere & Company.  This machine
allows  farmers to load forage into Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags ranging in
size from 9 to 10 feet in diameter  and 100 to 250 feet in length.  This machine
is  primarily  suitable for use by dairymen  with herds  ranging from 150 to 300
head and by cattlemen  feeding  between 300 and 800 head of feeder  cattle.  The
retail price for this machine ranges from approximately $70,000 to $175,000.

     The largest  version  consists of machines  that can be used to load Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags ranging in size from 9 to 12 feet in diameter and 150
to 500 feet in length.  These machines are used primarily by dairymen with herds
ranging  from 300 to 2,000 head,  by  cattlemen  with herds  ranging from 800 to
15,000 head, and by custom operators. A super 12-foot Ag-Bagger(R) was developed
in 1989 and  enhanced in 1995 for use by very large  dairy and custom  operators
and by cattle feeding  operations  with herds ranging from 15,000 to 25,000 head
of cattle.  The larger  machines are available with optional diesel engines made
by  Caterpillar  or Deere & Company.  The retail  price for the larger  machines
ranges from approximately $100,000 to $260,000.

     In response to a competitor's introduction of a cable-less machine in early
1995, the Company began research and  development on its own cable-less  machine
in early 1996.  The Company began  production of its own  cable-less  machine in
1997. In 1998, the Company  introduced its own cable-less bagging machine called
the HFC (Hydraulic Finger  Controlled)  Silage Bagger.  The introduction of this
machine was in response to what the Company  felt was a change in  direction  of
the industry  towards the  cable-less  machine  design and the latest in bagging
technology. In 1999, the Company continued to develop and improve its cable-less
bagging  machine by developing the Powered  Anchor Control (PAC) system,  and in
2000 introduced its latest version of the cable-less bagging machine,  the HYPAC
(Hydraulic Powered Anchor Control) system. The company offers the HYPAC model in
small,  medium-sized and large bagging machines.  The retail price for the HYPAC
machines range from approximately $45,000 to $260,000.

     The Company assembles and sells a separate line of related equipment called
the Ag-Bag  Flex-a-Tuber(R) with a retail price ranging from $11,000 to $17,000.
The Flex-a-Tuber(R)  permits farmers to store round-baled alfalfa,  sorghum, and
other forage in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) storage bags. The round bale Flex-a-Tubers(R)
are made in two sizes to permit the bagging of 4 and 5 foot bales. The bales can
be stored in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) storage bags up to 200 feet in length.

     The Company assembles and sells a separate line of related equipment called
the Square Bale Bagger which retails for between $23,000 to $30,000.  The Square
Bale Bagger permits farmers to store square bales of alfalfa,  sorghum and other
forage,  two bales high in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) flex storage bags. The Square Bale
Bagger permits the bagging of the bales in Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R) flex storage bags
of 7 to 10 feet in diameter and up to 200 feet in length.

                                       4
<PAGE>
     The Company  assembles  and sells the  Ag-Bag(R)  Pro-Grain  Bagger,  which
retails for between $25,000 to $30,000. This machine is similar in design to the
smallest  Ag-Bagger(R)  machines  but has been  adapted to permit the storage of
grains,  such as corn, rice, wheat and soybeans,  as well as other products,  in
Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags.  The machine  permits the grain to be bagged
without  damaging  the  kernel.  After the grain is bagged and  sealed,  it will
retain the necessary quality for human consumption.

     The Company also  assembles  and sells the Mighty  Bite(R)  front-end  load
bucket.   This   revolutionary   bucket   replaces  the   conventional   bucket.
Hydraulically  operated, the Mighty Bite(R) closes tightly around material, thus
eliminating spillage and increasing load capacity due to compaction. The Company
manufactures the Mighty Bite(R) in sizes ranging from one-half cubic yard to two
cubic yards with a retail price ranging from $2,500 to $4,500.

     The Company adapted its Ag-Bag(R)  bagging  machines for use in large scale
"in-vessel"  composting  of  organic  matter.  The  bagging  machine  is used in
conjunction with a shredder that shreds the organic material,  which is then fed
into  the  bagging  machine  that  bags  the  compostable   matter  into  Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags.  An air blower is attached to the bag and  circulates
air through the bag during the composting  process.  The Ag-Bag compost  bagging
machines retail for between $45,000 to $250,000.

     Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) Storage Bags. The Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R)  disposable storage
bags range in size from 8 to 12 feet in  diameter  and 100 to 500 feet in length
and are made of  extruded  plastic.  Rolls of plastic  are  manufactured  to the
Company's  specifications.  The plastic contains special  stabilizers to protect
the bags from deterioration due to exposure to weather and the sun's ultraviolet
rays.  Once a  Tri-Dura(R)  bag is used,  it may be  recycled  or disposed of in
another manner, but may not be reused.

     The  Company  contracts  for the  manufacture  of,  and  sells  Tri-Dura(R)
three-ply bags with a white exterior and black interior  intended for storage of
silage up to 24 months.  The retail price of the bags ranges from  approximately
$220 to $1,200.  The  manufactured  plastic  rolls are shipped to the  Company's
plant in Blair,  Nebraska,  where  they are  folded  and  packed  for sale using
proprietary  folding  techniques.  The proprietary bag folding techniques reduce
bag folding time and allow the bags to uniformly unfold when being filled, which
thereby reduces operational delays.

     Ag-Bag(R)  Inoculant.  The  Company  markets a liquid  inoculant  and a dry
powder inoculant under the trade name Ag-Bag Plus!(R). The inoculant is added to
the  forage  or the  round or square  bales  during  bagging.  It  enhances  the
fermentation  process  for  making  silage in bags,  bunkers,  pits and silos by
substantially  shortening the time  necessary for the creation of the silage.  A
liquid inoculant was developed in 1989 by a Company supplier and introduced into
the market in 1990.  The dry inoculant is produced  from a  proprietary  formula
owned by the  Company  and  developed  by Larry R. Inman and Walter L. Jay.  See
"Executive  Officers of the  Registrant."  The Company also markets an inoculant
designed specifically for composting.

Market Size
-----------

     The market  for  Ag-Bag(R)  machinery  and  Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  recyclable
storage  bags is primarily  in the dairy and beef cattle  industries.  Silage is
used most often as dairy and beef animal  feed.  It is also used by farmers to a
lesser extent to feed hogs and sheep.  In 1999, over  249,350,000  tons of corn,
alfalfa,  and sorghum silage were made by United States farmers according to the
AG IQ Handbook  XIII  published in 2000 by Agricom,  Inc.  (the "AG  Handbook").
Based  on  AG  Handbook  statistics,   the  Company  estimates  that  there  are
approximately  140,000  dairy,  beef,  hog, and sheep farms in the United States
that are  potential  customers  for Ag-Bag(R)  farm  equipment  and  Tri-Dura(R)
storage bags; and that only about 7-10% of this group are actually using storage
bags made by the Company and its  competitors.  It further  estimates that about
55-60% of the bagging industry  customers  purchase silage storage bags from the
Company.  In  addition  to the  U.S.,  the  Company  believes  there  is a large
population of such farms in Canada,  Latin America,  Western and Central Europe,
Australia,  New Zealand,  Asia,  the  Caribbean,  and England  where the Company
currently  sells and  distributes  its products,  and there is a large potential
market in other countries into which the Company may expand.

     The  Company  also  markets a system for  "in-vessel"  composting  which is
designed to  eliminate  odors and control  leachate  inherent  with  composting.
Composting is an alternative for disposing of or eliminating the large number of
organics  from  landfills.  The Company's  primary  focus is currently  directed
towards  municipalities,  private  composters,  military  bases,  zoos  and  the
Company's dairy and beef customers.  The Company currently estimates the size of
the compost  market  within  North  America to be over $1 billion a year.  Until
further  marketing  efforts are made outside North  America,  the Company cannot
estimate  with any  certainty  the foreign  market  size.  However,  the Company
believes that there is a large potential market in other countries into which it
may expand.  No assurance can be given that the  "in-vessel"  composting  system
will be accepted in either the domestic or foreign marketplace.


Marketing
---------

     The Company markets its Ag-Bag(R) farm equipment, Tri-Dura(R) storage bags,
Ag-Bag  Plus!(R)  and other  inoculants  primarily  through a network  of United
States, Canadian, and international dealers. As of December 31, 2000, there were
68  dealers  serviced  by a  combined  total  of  26  regional  and  territorial
Company-employed  managers and sales support  coordinators.  Most of the dealers
market the entire Ag-Bag(R) line of farm equipment and products;  however,  some
dealers  sell  only  the farm  equipment  and  others  sell  only the  Ag-Bag(R)
inoculants. The Company also sells farm equipment, Tri-Dura(R) storage bags, and
inoculant directly to large customers in states where there are no nearby Ag-Bag
dealers.

     The Company  offers  customers the  opportunity  to finance the purchase of
Ag-Bag(R)  farm  equipment   through   unaffiliated   third  parties  who  offer
lease-purchase financing.

     The Company rents Ag-Bag(R)  bagging machines to farmers in several western
states.  The rental  charge is based on the number of bags  purchased and filled
with forage. The Company also sells Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags in bulk to several
custom farming  operations in the state of California that own Ag-Bag(R) bagging
equipment. These operators place their private labels on the bags and bag forage
for customers on a fee-per-bag basis.

     Prior to December 31, 1997, the Company  offered a custom  bagging  service
through its subsidiary Ag-Bag Europe PLC in the United Kingdom. The Company sold
its subsidiary that had not been performing at a profitable level due to the BSE
(Mad Cow) problem within the British farming industry on December 31, 1997.

     The Company markets its composting  system through a sublicense that allows
the end user to use the  Ag-Bag(R)  compost  technology.  The  Company  plans to
establish a composting  dealer  network and develop a regional  and  territorial
sales force that will have expertise in  composting.  The timing for these plans
will depend on the pace of market acceptance of the Company's composting system.

     The Company is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers. The
loss of any  single  customer  would not have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's financial condition or results of operations.


Assembly and Manufacturing
--------------------------

     Ag-Bag(R) Farm  Equipment.  The Company buys some of its components for its
bagging  machines  from  various   manufacturers,   manufactures  the  remaining
components,  and  assembles  the  machines  itself.  The medium and large  sized
machines, composting machines, HYPAC (cable-less) machines, Square Bale Baggers,
and Flex-a-Tubers(R) are all assembled at the Company's headquarters facility in
Warrenton,  Oregon.  The smaller  machines are assembled at the Company's Blair,
Nebraska  plant.  The Company has licensed its German dealer to manufacture  the
mid-sized bagging machines for distribution within Europe.

     The Company  assembles  all of its machines in order to better  control the
quality of the farm  equipment.  This method  also  permits the Company to offer
customized  assembly for the end user of its equipment.  The Company can acquire
and install name brand manufactured components specified by the customer in lieu
of those ordinarily installed by the Company.

     Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R)  Storage Bags. All of the three-ply  Tri-Dura(R) storage
bags are  manufactured  for the Company by a single  manufacturer.  The bags are
manufactured  to the Company's  specifications  using a stabilizer that protects
the  plastic  from  becoming  brittle  due to  exposure to weather and the sun's
ultraviolet  light  rays.  The  Tri-Dura(R)  plastic  bags are  made in  various
diameters based on bag orders  received by the Company.  The bags are shipped in
roll form to the Company's plant in Blair,  Nebraska,  where they are folded and
packaged for shipment.

     Ag-Bag(R) Inoculants.  The liquid and compost inoculant is purchased by the
Company on the open  market.  The Company  believes  that the liquid and compost
inoculant  will be reasonably  available for purchase on the open market for the
foreseeable  future.  The dry inoculant is produced by the Company at the Blair,
Nebraska  plant  pursuant  to a  proprietary  formula  owned by the  Company and
developed  by Larry R. Inman and Walter L. Jay. See  "Executive  Officers of the
Registrant."


Principal Suppliers and Manufacturers
-------------------------------------

         The Company  purchases  its  Tri-Dura(R)  rolls from a company owned by
Steven G. Ross ("Supplier") pursuant to a supply agreement.  Steven G. Ross is a
14.9%  stockholder in the Company and owner of a company which competes with the
Company's  Tri-Dura(R)  bags.  The supply  agreement  provides  that the Company
purchase  all of its plastic  rolls,  with  certain  exceptions,  from  Supplier
through at least December 31, 2007.  Thereafter,  either the Company or Supplier
may terminate the Supply  Agreement  upon two years' prior written  notice.  The
Company may purchase  plastic rolls from other  suppliers to the extent Supplier
is unable to supply plastic rolls under the Supply Agreement.  The Company has a
good relationship with Supplier,  and there are alternative  suppliers available
in the event Supplier is unable to provide rolls.

     The structural  components of the Company's farm equipment are manufactured
in Oregon,  Nebraska and Iowa by several  manufacturing  companies.  The Company
believes that alternative sources of supply are readily available at competitive
prices if the present sources of supply should become  unavailable.  The

                                       7
<PAGE>
Company  is not aware of any raw  materials  shortages  or  problems  with these
suppliers that would adversely affect the Company's operations.

     The Company mixes the dry  inoculant at its Blair,  Nebraska  facility.  It
purchases the ingredients for the dry inoculant from a variety of suppliers. The
Company  purchases the liquid and compost  inoculant from a supplier,  who mixes
the inoculants to the Company's  specifications.  The Company believes there are
various other alternative sources of supply.


Competition
-----------

     As the Company's  corporate  slogan,  the  "Complete  One," indicates,  the
Company is the industry  leader in the  manufacture  and sale of complete sealed
feed farm bagging systems. Ag-Bag is the only company that manufactures the full
line of equipment,  bags, and other accessories for sealed feed farm management.
There are two  competitors  within the United  States that  manufacture  similar
silage bagging machines. There are also a number of competitors that manufacture
bale wrapping machines,  which compete with the Company's  Flex-a-Tuber(R).  The
Company  distinguishes  itself in the market  place from other  manufactures  by
providing  a top quality  product,  better  warranty  protection,  and  customer
service.

     The bag  market is highly  competitive.  The  Company  competes  in the bag
market by  providing  what the  Company  believes  to be a superior  product and
better warranty protection at a competitive price. The Company is also offering,
through  central pickup  locations in selected  geographic  areas of the U.S., a
recycling service for used Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) bags.

     The Company also competes with companies constructing bunkers and pits and,
to a lesser extent,  silos.  These competitors are mostly smaller companies that
build the  bunkers  and pits for the  farmer,  which the farmer  then fills with
forage using  available or rented farm  equipment  otherwise used in the farming
operation.  While these methods do not require bags or special equipment to fill
the  bags,  the  use of  these  alternatives  involves  a  significant  loss  of
flexibility  in storing  and  harvesting  the feed and an  overall  loss of feed
quality.  Flexibility is lost since  structures  must be permanently  placed and
significant capital  requirements are necessary to expand them. The feed quality
is inferior because of the amount of oxygen remaining after the forage is placed
in the pits or bunkers.

     The  Company  competes  primarily  with wind row  turner  manufacturers  in
composting. Wind row turners compost by turning and watering static piles weekly
and require  containment  of odor and leachate.  These turners are comparable in
price to the Company's  compost  machines.  However,  the  Company's  composting
systems  offer the  advantage of being  self-contained,  thus  reducing odor and
requiring no turning or watering.  There are  approximately  50 manufacturers of
turners. In addition to the wind row turner manufacturers,  the Company competes
with several companies that manufacture "in-vessel" systems, such as burners and
incinerators for large projects, which generally cost from $1 to $15 million.

     In addition to the current competition,  national competitors may emerge if
the bagging  equipment and storage bag markets continue to grow. These potential
competitors  include  large  farm  equipment  manufacturers  and large  chemical
companies who might decide to manufacture and sell the storage bags.

     The  Company  competes  in its product  markets  primarily  on the basis of
product  quality,  warranty  protection,  and  customer  service.  Some  of  its
competitors are larger and have greater  financial,  marketing,  technical,  and
other resources than the Company.

Backlog
-------

     In 2001,  backlog  orders were 16.7% lower than 2000.  The dollar amount of
backlog  orders of the Company that are believed to be firm as of March 1, 2001,
was approximately $3,250,000,  compared to $3,900,000 on March 1, 2000. Backlog,
however,  may not be a  meaningful  indicator of future  sales.  This backlog is
seasonal and is reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year.


Research and Development
------------------------

     During 2000, the Company focused  research and development  expenditures on
new silage and compost machine development.  The Company also completed research
on various projects  undertaken  regarding new silage and nutritional studies of
bagged feed and their effects on animal production during the year.


Environmental Matters
---------------------

     Compliance with federal,  state and local laws and  regulations  regulating
the discharge of materials into the  environment,  or otherwise  relating to the
protection of the environment, had no material effect upon capital expenditures,
earnings, or competitive positions of the Company during the year ended December
31, 2000.


Patents and Trademarks
----------------------

     The Company  has basic and  improvement  patents in the U.S.,  as well as a
number of patents pending, that encompass machines,  bags and systems for silage
bagging, grain bagging, and hay/straw bale bagging.  Corresponding  applications
have or will be filed in selected foreign  countries.  In addition,  proprietary
rights in the bagging of compost  have been and are being  developed  in the U.S
and in selected foreign countries.

     The Company's  patents on its basic  bagging  machine have been found to be
valid and have been  successfully  defended  in prior  litigation.  The  Company
believes  that it has  developed  its  position in the  industry  partially as a
result of  protection  provided  by these  patents.  The  Company  also owns the
proprietary  formula for making the dry inoculant  marketed under the trade name
Ag-Bag  Plus!(R),  which was developed by Larry R. Inman and Walter L. Jay. (See
"Executive Officers of the Registrant" and "Item 3. Legal Proceedings.")

     The  names  Ag-Bag(R),  Ag-Bag  Plus!(R),   Bale-Bag(R),   Flex-a-Tuber(R),
Flex-a-Tube(R),  ABCTI System(R),  Mighty Bite(R),  Tri-Dura(R),  and the symbol
"AB"(R) are all  registered  as  trademarks  with the United  States  Patent and
Trademark Office.

     The Company believes that its color scheme and trademarks are well known in
the  industry,  are an important  part of its  business,  and give the Company a
competitive advantage.

Employees
---------

     On December 31, 2000, the Company had 101 full-time employees.  The Company
employs  approximately 170 people during its busy season.  None of the Company's
employees are represented by a union, and the Company believes that its employee
relations are good.

Item 2.  Properties
-------------------

     In early 1990, the Company began  occupying its 30,000 square foot facility
located in Warrenton, Oregon. This facility serves as a warehouse and houses the
major  portion of its silage  bagging  equipment  manufacturing.  The  Company's
administrative  offices are also located  there.  Management  estimates that the
manufacturing  at the  Warrenton  plant is  currently  at  approximately  65% of
capacity.  The Company  occupies the land  pursuant to a lease which  expires in
2015.

     The Company owns facilities in Blair,  Nebraska,  where the Company;  folds
and  packages  its  Tri-Dura(R)  feed  storage  bags;  prepares and packages its
proprietary   inoculant;   and,  assembles  its  smaller  bagging  machines  and
warehouses  products.  During 1996, the Company began  consolidating  its Blair,
Nebraska,  operations into a newly constructed  facility which consists of three
buildings  comprising   approximately  70,000  square  feet.   Construction  was
completed on all  facilities and the Company fully occupied its new buildings in
early 1997.  Management  estimates that  manufacturing  at the Blair facility is
currently at approximately 75% of capacity.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
--------------------------

     The Company is one of three  defendants named in two purported class action
lawsuits,  S&S Forage & Equipment Co., Inc. v. Up North Plastics,  et al., filed
February 5, 1998, and Mr. and Mrs. Donald L. Steward v. Up North Plastics,  Inc.
et al.,  filed  September 29, 1999,  both alleging  conspiracy to fix prices and
sales quotas  involving  silage bag  manufacturers  and vendors.  Both cases are
pending  before the U.S.  District  Court for the District of  Minnesota.  Class
certification  has been  denied  in the S&S  Forage  case and no class  has been
certified in the Steward case.  The  plaintiffs and the defendants are currently
in settlement  negotiations on both the S&S Forage and Steward cases to have the
cases  dismissed and bring the proceedings to a close. If the plaintiffs were to
obtain a judgment against the three companies, the Company could be held jointly
and severally liable.  The Company believes that the plaintiffs'  claims have no
merit, and the Company is vigorously  defending itself against these claims. The
Company  believes  that the outcome of the  litigation  will not have a material
adverse  impact on its  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.  (See
"Factors Affecting Forward-Looking Statements.")

Item 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The Company's  Common Stock began trading publicly on January 17, 1990,
and was  approved for  quotation  on Nasdaq on April 24, 1990,  under the symbol
"AGBG." In 1997, the Nasdaq listing  requirements were  substantially  expanded.
The Company does not  currently  qualify under the more  stringent  requirements
because the price at which its Common Stock is trading is below the $1 per share
minimum.  The Company was formally  notified on January 13, 1999 that its Common
Stock was delisted from quotation on the Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market for failure to
meet the new listing  requirements.  The Company's Common Stock is now quoted on
the OTC Bulletin Board.

     As of March 6, 2001, there were  approximately 325 holders of record of the
Company's  Common Stock.  The Company  estimates there are  approximately  2,100
beneficial holders of the Company's Common Stock. The following table sets forth
the  range of high and low bid  prices  of the  Company's  Common  Stock for the

Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999
--------------------------------------

         For the year ended  December 31,  2000,  net sales  decreased  3.78% to
$31,451,150  compared to $32,686,832 for the year ended December 31, 1999. Sales
for the year  were  down as a result of record  low U.S.  milk  prices,  despite
supplemental  grain feed costs  remaining low, which helped farmers  continue to
have farm operating funds available. Additionally, competition in the silage bag
and  machine  market has  continued  to  increase  as  farmers  look to the most
economic bag or machine,  not considering overall quality,  customer service and
recycling of the used plastic  offered by the  Company.  Additionally,  with the
tightening of credit by financial  institutions  (especially in the U.S. farming
sector)  coupled  with the rising  interest  rates of 2000,  farmers have become
cautions on  purchases  of farm  machinery  and  equipment  until there is clear
upward movement in U.S. milk prices.

         Machine  sales  for the year were  down  7.87% and bag sales  were down
1.10% compared to 1999.  Machine sales are directly tied to farmers'  income and
therefore  their ability to purchase new equipment.  The Company's bag and parts
sales are  driven  by the  total  number  of  bagging  machines  that are in the
marketplace.  However,  there is not a perfect correlation between the Company's
bag  sales  and  machine  sales,  as the  Company's  and  competitors'  bags are
interchangeable  on all bagging  machinery in the industry.  The Company  cannot
estimate  with any  certainty  the total  number of machines or bags used in the
industry.  In addition to compost bag sales, the Company sold twelve  composting
systems during the year ended December 31, 2000 (generating  approximately  $1.2
million in revenue)  compared to five systems  sold for the year ended  December
31, 1999 (generating approximately $380,000 in revenue).

         Although the Company  sells its product  primarily  through a worldwide
dealer network, certain sales are made directly to large volume customers when a
dealer is not present in the customer's  geographic market. For each of the last
three  years,  the Company  estimates  direct  sales at between  32-37% of total
sales.  The Company expects its sales mix to begin to favor more direct sales in
the future, especially if the Company decides to offer e-commerce as a method of
ordering the Company's products.  The Company is currently evaluating whether it
will sell via  e-commerce.  The gross margin  realized on the  Company's  direct
sales are  typically  within 2-3  percent of those  sales  realized  through

                                       16
<PAGE>
the Company's  dealer  network.  However,  various  economic,  volume and market
factors in the geographic area impact the ultimate margin.

         International  sales for the Company in 2000 were down in comparison to
1999 due to continued  poor  economic  conditions  in the Latin  American/Mexico
market.  In 1999,  the  Company's  German dealer began  manufacturing  mid-sized
bagging  machines in Germany  under a license from the Company.  Therefore,  the
Company no longer  sells  mid-sized  machines  directly  to its  German  dealer.
Instead,  the Company receives a royalty fee for each mid-sized  machine sold by
its German  dealer,  which is recorded  as other  income.  In 1997,  the Company
formed a German  joint  venture in which the Company owns a 50% interest and its
German dealer owns the remaining 50%. The joint venture  distributes bags to the
Company's  German and European  dealers.  The Company's  earnings from the joint
venture are  reported  as other  income and are  accounted  for using the equity
method.  Approximately  $2.3 million in bag sales were  distributed  through the
venture during 2000, an increase of 35%, compared to approximately  $1.7 million
in bag sales for 1999.

         Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined 2.11% for the year ended
December 31, 2000 compared to the same period in 1999. The decline resulted from
lower  margins on bags in certain  highly  competitive,  high volume  geographic
areas.  The decline was also the result of lower overall margins on machinery as
a result  of  machine  competition  (particularly  in the  larger-sized  bagging
machines) in certain areas of the U.S.,  coupled with the mix of machine  models
sold during the year. (See "Item 1. Business - Farm Equipment and Products.")

         Selling  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 decreased  6.85%
to $3,329,880  compared to $3,574,830  for the year ended December 31, 1999. The
decrease  for the year was the  result of lower  sales  commissions  and  volume
discounts due to lower sales for the year,  partially offset by increased travel
and advertising and promotional expenses.

         Administrative  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 decreased
5.57% to $2,548,446 compared to $2,698,658 for the year ended December 31, 1999.
The  decrease  for  the  year  was the  result  of  lower  overall  general  and
administrative  operating  overheads  and  professional  fees related to ongoing
litigation which were offset by increases in insurance expense, employee benefit
costs and higher directors' fees.

         Research and development  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000
decreased  57.97% to $136,186  compared to $323,997 for the year ended  December
31, 1999.  The  decrease  for the year was the result of  completed  research on
various  projects  undertaken  regarding new silage and  nutritional  studies of
bagged feed and their effects on animal  production.  The Company  continues its
ongoing research related to new silage and compost machine development.

         Interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased 36.91%
to $456,158 in comparison to $333,170 for the year ended  December 31, 1999. The
increase for the year was the result of the Company  utilizing a larger  portion
of its credit  facilities  during seasonal  production  periods to meet seasonal
inventory  demands,  coupled with higher  interest  rates and some extended term
sales offered during the year to remain competitive.

         The Company's  effective tax rate for the year ended  December 31, 2000
was (1%).  This was primarily due to the recognition of research and development
credits.  In 2000,  the  Company  underwent  a study with a  consulting  firm to
determine  if costs  associated  with the  Company's  research  and  development
activities  were eligible for research and  development  tax credits in its open
tax years. The Company completed the study and filed the necessary forms for its
1996  through  1999 tax years  during  the year  2000,  generating  net  general
business tax credit benefits of approximately $270,000. Excluding the benefit of
the general business tax credits,  the effective income tax rate would have been
34% for the year ended December 31, 2000.

         Net income for the year ended  December  31, 2000  decreased  19.54% to
$521,814  compared to $648,571 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decline
for the year was the result of lower sales  caused by  continued  low U.S.  milk
prices,  lower  gross  profit  from  increased  competition  and  product mix of
machinery  models sold, and higher interest costs incurred,  partially offset by
lower selling, administrative, research and income tax expense.


Years Ended December 31, 1999 and 1998
--------------------------------------

         For the year ended  December 31, 1999,  net sales  increased  17.96% to
$32,686,832  compared to $27,710,514 for the year ended December 31, 1998. Sales
for the year were up as a result of the slightly  higher U.S. BFP (Basic Formula
Price) for milk during the main  harvest  season  months,  despite the first and
fourth  quarters sharp decline in BFP. In addition,  continued low  supplemental
grain feed costs have spurred  farmer's  capital  expenditures for machinery and
equipment.  The Company believes recent independent university research articles
published on the benefits of bagging over the use of bunkers and silos have also
helped to increase sales, as farmers are realizing the benefits of bagging their
feed instead of storing it in bunkers or silos.

         Machine  sales for the year were up 27.94% and bag sales were up 17.53%
compared  to 1998.  Machine  sales are  directly  tied to  farmers'  income  and
therefore  their ability to purchase new equipment.  The Company's bag and parts
sales are  driven  by the  total  number  of  bagging  machines  that are in the
marketplace.  However,  there is not a perfect correlation between the Company's
bag  sales  and  machine  sales,  as the  Company's  and  competitors'  bags are
interchangeable  on all bagging  machinery in the industry.  The Company  cannot
estimate  with any  certainty  the total  number of machines or bags used in the
industry.  In addition to compost bag sales,  the Company  sold five  composting
systems  during the year  ended  December  31,  1999  (generating  approximately
$380,000 in revenue)  compared to seven systems sold for the year ended December
31, 1998 (generating approximately $550,000 in revenue).

         Although the Company  sells its product  primarily  through a worldwide
dealer network, certain sales are made directly to large volume customers when a
dealer is not present in the customer's  geographic market. For each of the last
three years, the Company estimates direct sales at between 30-35% of total sales
and the Company expects this historical sales mix to continue in the future. The
gross margin realized on the Company's direct sales are typically within 200-300
basis  points of those sales  realized  through the  Company's  dealer  network.
However,  various  economic,  volume and market factors in the  geographic  area
impact the ultimate margin.

         International  sales for the Company in 1999 were down in comparison to
1998 due to continued  poor  economic  conditions  in the Latin  American/Mexico
market.   Additionally,   the  Company's  mid-sized  bagging  machines  are  now
manufactured in Germany and not sold directly to its German dealer. As a result,
the  Company  now  receives a royalty  fee for each  machine  produced  which is
recorded as other income.  In 1997, the Company formed a German joint venture in
which the Company owns a 50% interest and its German  dealer owns the  remaining
50%. The joint venture  distributes  bags to the  Company's  German and European
dealers.  The Company's  equity in earnings of the venture are reported as other
income.  Approximately  $1.7 million in bag sales were  distributed  through the
venture during 1999, an increase of 13%, compared to approximately  $1.5 million
in bag sales for 1998.

         Gross  profit as a  percentage  of sales  declined  for the year  ended
December 31, 1999 compared to the same period in 1998. The decline resulted from
lower margins on bags in certain  geographic,  highly  competitive,  high volume
areas.  The decline was also the result of lower margins on machinery during the
first and  fourth  quarters  of 1999 which were  offset by  improved  margins on
machinery resulting from increased  production  efficiencies being realized from
seasonal  machine  production  ramp-up in the second and third  quarters  of the
year.

         Selling  expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased 18.15%
to $3,574,830  compared to $3,025,642  for the year ended December 31, 1998. The
increase  for the  year was the  result  of  increased  sales  personnel  costs,
commissions and related benefits and volume discounts  resulting from the higher
sales volumes.

         Administrative  expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased
10.42% to  $2,698,658  compared to  $2,444,060  for the year ended  December 31,
1998.  The  increase  for the year  was the  result  of  increased  general  and
administrative   operating  overheads  coupled  with  higher  professional  fees
relating to ongoing litigation.

         Research and development  expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999
increased  115.91% to $323,997  compared to $150,058 for the year ended December
31, 1998.  The increase for the year was the result of increased  research costs
related to new silage and compost machine  development,  coupled with new silage
and nutritional studies of bagged feed and their effects on animal production.

          Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 decreased 23.90%
to $333,170  compared to $437,803  for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  The
decrease for the year was the result of the Company  utilizing a smaller portion
of its credit facilities due to accelerated collections of accounts receivable.

         Net income for the year ended  December  31, 1999  decreased  19.37% to
$648,571 compared to $804,399 for the year ended December 31, 1998. The decrease
for the year was the result of lower bag margins in certain  high  volume  areas
coupled with lower  machine  margins  during the first and fourth  quarters.  In
addition, increased selling, administrative and research expenses contributed to
the decline for the year, which were partially offset by increased sales volumes
and lower interest costs.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements
--------------------------------

         Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS) 133, Accounting for
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities,   as  amended  by  SFAS  137,
Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities - Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB  Statement No. 133, and SFAS 138,  Accounting for Certain
Derivative  Instruments  and Certain  Hedging  Activities,  is effective for the
Company as of July 1,  2000.  SFAS 133  requires  that an entity  recognize  all
derivatives  as  either  assets  or  liabilities  measured  at fair  value.  The
accounting  for changes in the fair value of a derivative  depends on the use of
the derivative. The Company does not believe that adoption of SFAS 133 will have
a material impact on its financial statement.

         The Securities and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) issued Staff  Accounting
Bulletin (SAB) 101,  Revenue  Recognition in Financial  Statements,  in December
1999. The SAB summarizes  certain of the SEC staff's views in applying generally
accepted accounting  principles to revenue recognition in financial  statements.
In June 2000, the SEC issued SAB 101B, which delays the  implementation  date of
SAB 101 until no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal years  beginning
after  December 15, 1999. The Company does not believe that adoption of this SAB
will have a material impact on its financial statements.

         In March 2000, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued
FASB  Interpretation  (FIN) 44,  Accounting for Certain  Transactions  involving
Stock  Compensation,  which  clarifies  the  application  of APB 25 for  certain
issues.  The interpretation is effective July 1, 2000, except for the provisions
that relate to  modifications  that directly or  indirectly  reduce the exercise
price of an award and the definition of an employee,  which are effective  after
December 15,1998. The Company does not believe that adoption of FIN 44 will have
a material impact on its financial statements.

         In June 1997, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  (SFAS)  No.  130,  "Reporting
Comprehensive  Income", which establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components (revenue, expenses, gains and losses) in
a  full  set  of  general  purpose  financial  statements.   The  company  fully
implemented SFAS No. 130 during 1998.

         In June 1997, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 131,  "Disclosure about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", which changes the way public
companies report information about operating segments.  SFAS No. 131 is based on
the management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report
selected segment  information  quarterly and to report  entity-wide  disclosures
about products and services, major customers and the material countries in which
the entity holds assets and reports revenue.  The company fully implemented SFAS
No. 131 during 1998 and determined that it has no reportable segments.

Year 2000
---------

         The  Company  did  not  experience  any  computer  system  transitional
problems as a result of the Year 2000 "bug". The year 2000  transitional  issues
had no material impact on the operations,  cash flows or financial  condition of
the Company.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

         The seasonal nature of the northern  hemisphere  farming industry,  the
production  time for  equipment  and the time  required to prepare  bags for use
requires the Company to  manufacture  and carry high  inventories  to meet rapid
delivery  requirements.  In particular,  the Company must maintain a significant
level of bags  during  the  spring  and early  summer to meet the sales  demands
during the harvest season.  The Company uses working capital and trade credit to
increase its inventory so that it has sufficient  inventory  levels available to
meet its sales demands through the spring and summer.

         The Company  relies on its  suppliers to provide trade credit to enable
the  Company to build its  inventory.  The  Company's  suppliers  have  provided
sufficient trade credit to meet the demand to date and management  believes this
will continue. No assurance can be given that suppliers will continue to provide
sufficient trade credit in the future.

         Accounts receivable increased 56.81% at December 31, 2000 to $2,941,379
compared to $1,875,777  at December 31, 1999.  The increase for the year was the
result of  collections  slowing due to the  tightening  credit in the U.S.  farm
sector of the economy,  coupled with the fact the Company  offered some extended
term sales  during the fourth  quarter to remain  competitive.  The  Company has
established  adequate  reserves  ($247,690  at  December  31,  2000  compared to
$147,024 at December 31, 1999)  against  accounts  receivable  in the event that
some accounts become uncollectable.

         Inventory  increased 3.12% at December 31, 2000 to $7,392,557  compared
to  $7,168,740  at December 31, 1999.  The increase in inventory  resulted  from
continued  production  during the latter  part of the third  quarter to maintain
production  efficiencies on the Company's  smaller bagging  machines and to have
inventory  available for pre-season flooring and early order programs offered by
the Company during the fourth quarter. However, with continued tightening credit
within the U.S. economy during the fourth quarter,  the Company did not move the
quantity of inventory that it had  anticipated.  To counteract this, the Company
delayed  production for its 2001 season to reduce its current  inventory levels,
while fulfilling current demands.

         Intangible assets at December 31, 2000 decreased to $21,506 compared to
$35,562 at December 31, 1999. The decrease was the result of normal amortization
expense for the year.


                                       20
<PAGE>
         The Company has an operating line of credit with a limit of $5,000,000,
secured  by  accounts  receivable  and  inventory.  As  of  December  31,  2000,
$1,224,638 had been drawn under the credit line. On January 3, 2000, the Company
obtained a $500,000 equipment acquisition line of credit for the purchase of new
business equipment for the year 2000. The equipment line of credit is secured by
a fixed asset  blanket  lien.  As of December 31, 2000,  $500,000 had been drawn
under this equipment acquisition line of credit. Management believes that, funds
generated  from  operations  and the Company's  operating line of credit will be
sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements through 2001.

         In 1997, the Nasdaq listing  requirements were substantially  expanded.
The Company does not  currently  qualify under the more  stringent  requirements
because the price at which its Common Stock is trading is below the $1 per share
minimum.  The Company was formally notified on January 13, 1999, that its Common
Stock was delisted from quotation on the Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market for failure to
meet the new listing  requirements.  The Company's Common Stock is now quoted on
the OTC Bulletin Board. The removal from quotation on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market
could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on the  Company's  ability  to  raise
additional  equity  capital  in a  public  stock  offering  should  that  become
necessary.

         In December of 1998,  the Company  announced  that it retained  Pacific
Crest  Securities  and Columbia  Financial  Advisors,  Inc. as their  investment
banking  representatives to explore strategic  alternatives.  As of December 31,
2000, this engagement was completely terminated.

Factors Affecting Forward-Looking Statements
--------------------------------------------

You should carefully  consider the following factors  regarding  forward-looking
statements and other information  included in this Annual Report.  The risks and
uncertainties  described below are not the only ones we face.  Additional  risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
also may impair our business operations.  If any of the following risks actually
occur,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  operating  results  could  be
materially adversely affected.

o    We are dependent on the Dairy Industry

         More than 75% of our revenues come from the dairy industry.

o    A downturn in the dairy industry could cause a reduction in our revenues.

         Our sales are highly  correlated  with the price of milk  products  and
         revenues of the dairy industry. When dairy farmers make money, they buy
         our  products.  When  dairy  farmers  are not making  money,  our sales
         decline.

o    Our revenues are seasonal and dependent on weather conditions.

         Our core business is dependent on weather conditions during the harvest
         seasons in North America and Europe.  Adverse weather conditions affect
         farmers'  crops  and  reduce  demand  for our  products.  Approximately
         65%-72% of our revenue is generated in the second and third quarters.

o    We may lose one or both of the two class action lawsuits pending against
     us.

         Two class action lawsuits,  both alleging  antitrust  violations,  have
         been  filed  against  us and  others.  If our  efforts  to  dismiss  or
         favorably  resolve  the  suits  fail,  we could  incur  additional  and
         significant  litigation  costs and experience a drain on management and
         other resources.  If the plaintiffs  succeed in establishing  liability
         and obtain a judgment  for  damages,  the award could exceed our entire
         net worth.

                                       21
<PAGE>
o    We may lose one or both of the two product warranty lawsuits pending
     against us.

         Two product warranty  lawsuits,  have been filed against us and others.
         If our efforts to dismiss or favorably resolve the suits fail, we could
         incur  additional  and  significant  litigation  costs and experience a
         drain on management and other resources.

o    We may lose the alleged patent infringement lawsuit pending against us.

         An alleged  patent  infringement  lawsuit has been filed against us. If
         our effort to dismiss or  favorably  resolve the suit  fails,  we could
         incur  additional  and  significant  litigation  costs and experience a
         drain on management and other resources.

o    Our intellectual property protection may not be adequate.

         We have patents on our basic bagging  machines and patents  pending for
         additional machines, bags and systems for silage bagging, grain bagging
         and  hay/straw  bale  bagging.  We may not obtain these patents and our
         patents may not withstand litigation challenges.  If our patents do not
         withstand  litigation  challenges,  our  rights in its bag and  machine
         technology could be diminished or eliminated. Moreover, the issuance of
         patents  covering any of our products  may be  insufficient  to prevent
         competitors  from  duplicating  our products.  The patent laws of other
         countries  may  differ  from  those  of  the  United  States  as to the
         patentability  of  our  products  and  processes,  and  the  degree  of
         protection  afforded by foreign  patents may be different  from that in
         the United States.

o    We rely on one principal supplier for our bags.

         We purchase  nearly all of our bags from one supplier under a long-term
         requirements  contract.  Any  disruption of the  manufacturing  process
         could  affect  that  company's  ability to supply our needs,  and could
         adversely affect our sales.

o    Our pricing is dependent on the price of resin.

         The prices that we pay for bags, which account for  approximately  half
         of our  annual  sales,  are  fixed  annually  in  advance  and are tied
         directly to the price of resin.  Resin  prices have  historically  been
         subject to significant price volatility. Increases in the price of bags
         could  adversely  affect  our  profit  margins if we are unable to pass
         along the price  increase,  and would  likely  affect our  revenues  if
         alternatives to our product become more attractive because of the price
         increases.

o    Our stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, which may make the stock
     more difficult to sell.

         We no longer satisfy the criteria for continued quotation on The Nasdaq
         SmallCap  Market.  Our stock is,  instead,  quoted on the OTC  Bulletin
         Board.  As a result,  our  shareholders  may find it more  difficult to
         dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of,
         our  common  stock,  and the  market  price  for our  common  stock may
         decline.  Trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of
         Rule 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under
         this  rule,  broker/dealers  who  recommend  low-priced  securities  to
         persons other than established  customers and accredited investors must
         satisfy  special sales practice  requirements,  including a requirement
         that they make an individualized written suitability  determination for
         the purchaser and receive the purchaser's  written consent prior to the
         transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform
         Act of 1990 also requires additional  disclosure in connection with any
         trades involving a stock defined as a



                                       22
<PAGE>
         penny stock (generally any equity security not traded on an exchange or
         quoted on Nasdaq that has a market  price of less than $5.00 per share,
         subject to certain  exceptions),  including the delivery,  prior to any
         penny stock transaction,  of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny
         stock  market and the risks  associated  with the penny  stock  market.
         These  requirements  could severely  limit the market  liquidity of our
         common  stock and the ability of our  shareholders  to dispose of their
         shares, particularly in a declining market.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Ag-Bag International Limited


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Ag-Bag International  Limited
as of December  31,  2000 and 1999,  and the  related  statements  of income and
comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Ag-Bag International Limited as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999,  and the results of its  operations  and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

AG-BAG INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION  OF  BUSINESS - Ag-Bag  International  Limited  (the  Company)  is a
Delaware corporation. The Company's primary operations include the manufacturing
and sale of machines and related bags used in the agriculture  industry to store
feed for  livestock,  grain and other  products.  The Company also  manufactures
machines and bags for composting. The Company's primary market is North America;
however, it sells products worldwide.

The Company's  common stock began trading  publicly on January 17, 1990, and was
approved for quotation on Nasdaq on April 24, 1990,  under the symbol "AGBG." In
1997, the Nasdaq listing requirements were substantially  expanded.  The Company
does not currently  qualify under the more  stringent  requirements  because the
price at which its common stock is trading is below the $1 per share minimum bid
price.  The Company was formally  notified on January 13, 1999,  that its common
stock was delisted from quotation on the Nasdaq  inter-dealer  quotation  system
for failure to meet the new listing requirements.  The Company's common stock is
now traded on the OTC Bulletin Board.

STATEMENTS  OF CASH FLOWS - For purposes of the  statements  of cash flows,  the
Company  considers all highly  liquid  investments  with original  maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

The Company transferred $139,432, $71,236, and $185,863 in 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively,  from rental  equipment to inventory  held for sale. In 2000,  the
Company transferred $111,863 from inventory held for sale to rental equipment.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - Accounts receivable are from distributors and customers of
the Company's products.  The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its
customers and maintains  allowances for potential credit losses. Also, to reduce
the risk of credit  loss,  the Company  requires  letters of credit from foreign
customers with which no credit history has been established.

INVENTORIES  -  Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower of cost or  market  (net
realizable value). The Company determines cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
basis. The Company's estimates of market value incorporate projections of future
sales volume by product class. In estimating the market value of parts inventory
items,  the  Company  reviews  current  inventory  levels in  relation  to sales
forecasts  and adjusts the  valuation  reserve  accordingly.  For the  remaining
categories of inventory,  the Company establishes a reserve balance based on the
aging of the specific inventory items.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost
and are  depreciated on the  straight-line  method over their  estimated  useful
lives which range from five to seven  years for  equipment  and twenty to thirty
years for buildings.

Expenditures for additions and major improvements are capitalized.  Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS - Intangible assets consist of licenses and patents.  The cost
of the  licenses and patents are  amortized  over the lesser of the terms of the
related agreement or the estimated useful lives of the respective asset, ranging
from three to twelve years.

STOCK OPTION PLAN - The Company accounts for its stock option plan in accordance
with the  provisions  of  Accounting  Principles  Board  (APB)  Opinion  No. 25,
"Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees,"  and related  interpretations.  As
such,  compensation  expense related to grants to employees would be recorded on
the date of grant  only if the  current  market  price of the  underlying  stock
exceeded the exercise  price.  The Company has also adopted the disclosure  only
provisions  of  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."

INCOME  TAXES - The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  under  the asset and
liability  method.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized for the
future tax  consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial
statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their
respective  tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are measured using
enacted  tax rates  expected  to apply to  taxable  income in the years in which
those temporary  differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Valuation
allowances are  established to reduce  potential  deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that all or some portion of  potential  deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

ADVERTISING COSTS - The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.
Advertising  expenses for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998 were
$532,573, $466,270, and $490,495, respectively.

NET  INCOME  PER COMMON  SHARE - In  February  1997,  the  Financial  Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 128, "Earnings per Share." SFAS No. 128 establishes  standards for computing
and presenting  earnings per share (EPS). It simplifies the standards in APB No.
15 (Earnings per Share) for  computing  EPS by replacing  primary EPS with basic
EPS and altering the  calculation  of diluted EPS,  which replaces fully diluted
EPS.

Basic net income per share is calculated  using the weighted  average  number of
common shares  outstanding  during each year.  Preferred  stock  dividends  were
considered in the  computation.  The calculation of diluted net income per share
excludes the effect of potentially  dilutive  common stock  equivalents  because
their impact, when calculated using the Treasury stock method, is antidilutive.

SEGMENT  INFORMATION - The Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 131,  "Disclosure about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which changed the way public
companies reported  information about operating segments.  SFAS No. 131 is based
on the management  approach to segment  reporting,  establishes  requirements to
report  selected  segment  information   quarterly  and  to  report  entity-wide
disclosures  about  products  and  services,  major  customers  and the material
countries in which the entity holds assets and reports revenue.  The Company has
fully  implemented  SFAS  No.  131  and  determined  that  it has no  reportable
segments.


DISCLOSURE  OF FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  - The  carrying  amounts of
financial   instruments   including  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  accounts
receivable  approximated  fair value as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 because of
the relatively short maturity of these instruments.  The carrying value of notes
payable  approximated  fair value as of  December  31,  2000 and 1999 based upon
interest rates and terms available for the same or similar loans.

MANAGEMENT  ESTIMATES - The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS  -  Certain  reclassifications  have  been  made  to the  1999
financial statements to conform with the 2000 presentation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue on machine and bag sales is recognized at the time
the product is shipped to the customer.

WARRANTY  - At the  time of  sale,  the  Company  accrues  a  liability  for the
estimated  future  costs to be incurred  under the  provisions  of its  warranty
agreements.

NOTE 10 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, continued

STOCK  AWARDS - The  Company has a 1991  Employee  Stock Plan (the Plan) and has
reserved 133,575 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan. Under terms
of the Plan,  stock is awarded to employees at the sole  discretion of the Board
of Directors. No awards were granted under the Plan for 2000, 1999, and 1998.

COMMON  STOCK  OPTIONS - The Company  has an  Incentive  Stock  Option Plan (the
Incentive  Plan) and has  reserved  185,000  shares of common stock for issuance
under the  Incentive  Plan.  Options  under the  Incentive  Plan are issuable to
officers  and  employees  of the  Company  and all option  grants will be at the
market  value of the stock at the date of grant.  Vesting  of stock  options  is
determined for each grant by the Board of Directors.

During 1996, the Company adopted a Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan ( the
Director  Plan) and has reserved  1,000,000  shares of common stock for issuance
under the Director  Plan. The Director Plan grants 50,000 options to each member
of the Board of Directors  who is not an employee of the Company.  Forty percent
of the 50,000  options  vest and become  exercisable  six months after the grant
date, another 40% of the options vest and become exercisable two years after the
grant date, and the remaining portion of the options vest and become exercisable
three  years after the grant date.  Beginning  with the annual  meeting in 2000,
those directors who have served a three (3) year period, receive an annual grant
of 10,000 options which become exercisable six months after the grant date.

The Company has computed,  for pro forma disclosure  purposes,  the value of all
options granted during 2000 and 1998, using the  Black-Scholes  pricing model as
prescribed  under SFAS 123. The  following  assumptions  were made for grants in
2000 and 1998:  risk-free interest rate of 6.1% and 5.5% respectively,  expected
life of seven  years and three years  respectively,  and  dividend  rate of zero
percent.  For 2000 and 1998, the expected  volatility over the expected lives of
the grants was  assumed  to be 75% and 56% for 2000 and 1998  respectively.  The
weighted  average fair value of the options  granted was estimated to be $.29 in
2000 and $.41 in 1998.

If the Company had accounted for the value of the options  granted  during 2000,
1999, and 1998, in accordance  with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

                                 ---------  ---------  ---------

     Net income :
         As reported             $ 521,814  $ 648,571  $ 804,399
         Pro forma               $ 510,023  $ 618,739  $ 796,534

     Net income  per share:

believes  there  are  adequate  alternative  suppliers  available  in the  event
Supplier is unable to provide rolls.

normal course of business.  Management is of the opinion that these matters will
