ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
-----------------

GENERAL
-------

     Ag-Bag  International  Limited (the "Company" or "Ag-Bag") was incorporated
as a New York  corporation  in  1989.  The  primary  operating  company,  Ag-Bag
Corporation,  a Nebraska  corporation,  was  incorporated  in 1978.  The Company
changed its name in 1990 from AB Holding  Group,  Inc.  to Ag-Bag  International
Limited. In 1994, in an effort to streamline and save  administrative  expenses,
two of the  Company's  operating  subsidiaries,  A.B.  Rental,  Inc.  and Ag-Bag
Corporation  were merged into the Delaware  subsidiary,  ABVIN  Merging Corp. On
January 1, 1995, the Company was merged into its Delaware  subsidiary  resulting
in the  reincorporation  of the Company in Delaware  and a change in its name to
Ag-Bag International Limited.

     The  Company  has  pioneered  an  alternate  method  of  storing  feed  for
livestock.  Traditional  methods of  storing  feed have  included  placing it in
bunkers,  pits, and silos or baling and stacking it. The Company's  method is to
store the feed in huge  plastic  bags of up to 500 feet in  length  and up to 14
feet in  diameter  by  tightly  stuffing  the feed  into the  bag.  The  Company
assembles  the machines  for  stuffing  the feed into the bags.  It has the bags
manufactured  to its  specifications  and then  folds and  distributes  the bags
through  its  dealer  network  and  directly  in an area  where a dealer  is not
present.  The  benefits of bagging the feed  include  reduced  cost,  additional
flexibility  in harvesting  and storing the feed,  enhanced  feed  quality,  and
relatively small capital requirements. The Company also sells ancillary products
that complement the Company's main line of bagging machines and bags.


                                        2

     The  following  table  identifies  the revenue  from each product line that
accounted for more than 15% of total revenue over the last three years:

          Product                   2001            2002             2003
          -------                -----------      ----------      -----------
          Bags                      48%              48%             49%
          Machines                  43%              44%             40%
          Other                      9%              8%              11%
                                 -----------      ----------      -----------
          Net Sales                 100%            100%             100%

     The  Company  expects  the use of bagging  as a means of silage  storage to
continue  to play a major role in the future  because the quality of stored feed
is better  than other known  competitive  methods,  allowing  farmers to be more
efficient and to produce dairy,  beef, sheep and pork products at a lower price.
The Company  believes the concept of bagging is one way in which  farmers can be
more profitable by reducing, or completely eliminating, the purchase of feed and
grain from outside sources.  Bagging enables the farmer to produce and store the
feed on the farm and provides easier access to the silage,  thereby allowing the
farmer to choose  the  quality of silage to feed at any given  time.  The bagged
feed has shown high quality, allowing for higher production.

     In 1994,  the Company  shipped its first orders to dealers in Japan,  Latin
America and Germany. The Company continues to sell worldwide in Asia, Australia,
New Zealand,  and Western and Central  Europe.  Export sales from the  Company's
United States  operations were 6.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31,
2003.

     In 1997,  the Company  formed a German  joint  venture in which the Company
owns a 50%  interest  and its German  dealer owns the  remaining  50%. The joint
venture folds and distributes  silage bags to the Company's  German and European
dealers.

     The Company is developing other uses for its bagging  technology.  In 1993,
the  Company  adapted  its bagging  machines  to permit  bagging of  compostable
organic matter in the Company's recyclable Tri-Dura(R) plastic bags. The Company
also has developed mobile and stationary plastic recovery units which enable the
Company to bail and pick up the recyclable Tri-Dura(R) plastic bags as a service
to its customers.

SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS
---------------------------

     The core  business  of the  Company  is  historically  seasonal  due to the
harvest seasons in North America and Europe. The Company's machinery tends to be
purchased in anticipation  of the next harvest  season,  so most of the sales of
machinery  occur in the spring and summer.  This  requires  the Company to carry
significant  amounts  of  inventory  to  meet  rapid  delivery  requirements  of
customers.  Bag sales  tend to occur as the  harvest  season  approaches  in the
summer,  and during the harvest  season in the fall.  The Company  took steps to
counteract  some of this  seasonality  by  generating  sales  in  Latin  America
beginning in 1994 and in Australia and New Zealand in 1996.  In September  2002,
the Company took  additional  steps to counteract  seasonality by developing and
introducing a pre-season  ordering program,  whereby the Company's dealers place
their next year's annual product  requirements  order in advance and utilize one
of the Company's  third party  financing  sources.  The  pre-season  program has
allowed  the  Company to know in advance  its  production  mix which in turn has
provided the Company with the ability to level its production and flexibility in
customer  shipments.  During 2003, the Company expanded this program by allowing
dealers to finance  through  their local bank,  rather  than  requiring  them to
utilize one of the Company's third party financing programs.  This however,  has
brought  seasonality  back into play for the  Company,  as  shipments  under the
dealer  bank  program  are at the timing of the dealer  rather  than the Company
under the terms of the program. The pre-season order program is

                                        3
<PAGE>
a program  under which the Company  pays the  flooring  interest for dealers and
pays volume  discounts to dealers  based upon a sliding  scale for the volume of
orders placed by the dealer under the program.

     Approximately 95% of the Company's business is concentrated in the Northern
Hemisphere  resulting in between 53-70% of the Company's revenue being generated
during the  spring  and  summer  (2nd and 3rd  Quarters).  The  following  table
outlines the percentage of revenue over the past three years by quarter:

          Quarter                  2001            2002             2003
          -------
                                -----------      ----------      -----------
          First                    15%              18%             32%
          Second                   35%              37%             27%
          Third                    35%              32%             26%
          Fourth                   15%              13%             15%

As a result of the  introduction  in September 2002 and  modification in 2003 of
the Company's Pre-Season order program, these historical revenue percentages may
not be indicative of future revenue percentage by quarter.


FARM EQUIPMENT AND PRODUCTS
---------------------------

     Introduction.  Silage is made using the Ag-Bag(R)  system by storing forage
crops,  such as corn,  sorghum,  or alfalfa,  under anaerobic  (without  oxygen)
conditions in sealed Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags. The traditional  methods
for  making  silage  involve  storing  it  in  bunkers,  pits  or  silos.  Using
traditional methods,  there is a nutrient loss resulting from a reduction in the
moisture  content of the forage  before  storage.  The moisture  content must be
reduced to compensate for the high oxygen  content of the forage,  which results
from the  inability to pack the forage  tightly  enough.  When the forage is not
packed  sufficiently,  the silage  fermentation  process  produces too much heat
resulting  in an even  greater  loss of  nutrient  value than would occur if the
moisture  content were not reduced.  The loss of nutrient  value  results in the
need for additional food supplements or an increased volume of feed.

     The Ag-Bag(R)  system is an  alternative  to bunkers,  pits and silos.  The
Ag-Bag(R)  bagging  machines push the forage into huge  recyclable  plastic film
Tri-Dura(R) bags with sufficient  compaction to minimize the amount of oxygen in
the bag, which is then sealed tightly when filled.  As a result,  the forage can
be stored with significantly  higher moisture content.  The ability to store the
forage in this manner also reduces the time  required to cut,  prepare and store
the forage thus reducing the loss of nutrients and providing higher quality feed
for production within the farmers' herds.

     Ag-Bag(R) Farm Equipment. The Company's principal line of farm equipment is
marketed under the trade name  "Ag-Bagger(R)."  The Ag-Bagger(R) is available in
three  versions  with a number of  optional  features.  Wide  ranges of optional
features are offered by the Company on its bagging machines in order to meet the
budget needs of the farmer.

     The smallest version consists of machines used to load forage into Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R) storage bags ranging in size from 8 to 10 feet in diameter and 100
to 250 feet in length. The Company first introduced this version in 1987.
Dairymen use it primarily in smaller dairy and cattle feeding operations with
herds averaging about 50 head and by cattlemen feeding up to about 300 head of
feeder cattle. Most of these machines are powered by the power take-off unit of
a farm tractor and moved by a tractor or other farm vehicle. In late 2002, the
Company introduced its most basic model of its smaller bagging machine, the
"Personal Bagger". The retail price for these machines range from approximately
$19,900 to $53,000.

                                        4
<PAGE>
     In 1992, the Company introduced a medium-sized machine that can be operated
by the power take-off unit of a farm tractor or operated  independently  with an
optional  diesel  engine made by  Caterpillar  or Deere & Company.  This machine
allows  farmers to load forage into Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags ranging in
size from 9 to 10 feet in diameter  and 100 to 250 feet in length.  This machine
is  primarily  suitable for use by dairymen  with herds  ranging from 150 to 300
head and by cattlemen  feeding  between 300 and 800 head of feeder  cattle.  The
retail price for this machine ranges from approximately $80,000 to $228,500.

     The largest  version  consists of machines  that can be used to load Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage  bags ranging in size from 9 to 14 feet in diameter and 150
to 500 feet in length.  These machines are primarily used by dairymen with herds
ranging  from 300 to 2,000 head,  by  cattlemen  with herds  ranging from 800 to
15,000 head, and by custom operators. A super 12-foot Ag-Bagger(R) was developed
in 1989 and  enhanced  in 1995.  In 2002,  the  Company  introduced  its 14-foot
version of the Ag-Bagger(R) for use by very large dairy and custom operators and
by cattle  feeding  operations  with herds ranging from 15,000 to 25,000 head of
cattle.  The larger  machines are available with optional diesel engines made by
Caterpillar.  The retail price for the larger machines range from  approximately
$155,000 to $325,000.

     In response to a competitor's introduction of a cable-less machine in early
1995, the Company began research and  development on its own cable-less  machine
in early 1996.  The Company began  production of its own  cable-less  machine in
1997. In 1998, the Company  introduced its own cable-less bagging machine called
the HFC (Hydraulic Finger  Controlled)  Silage Bagger.  The introduction of this
machine was in response to what the Company  felt was a change in  direction  of
the industry  towards the  cable-less  machine  design and the latest in bagging
technology. In 1999, the Company continued to develop and improve its cable-less
bagging  machine by developing the Powered  Anchor Control (PAC) system,  and in
2000  introduced  its latest  version of the  cable-less  bagging  machine,  the
HYPAC(R)  (Hydraulic  Powered  Anchor  Control)  system.  The Company offers the
HYPAC(R) model in small,  medium-sized  and large-sized  bagging  machines.  The
retail  price for the  HYPAC(R)  machines  range from  approximately  $53,000 to
$325,000.

     The Company assembles and sells a separate line of related equipment called
the Ag-Bag  Flex-a-Tuber(R) with a retail price ranging from $11,500 to $18,000.
The Flex-a-Tuber(R)  permits farmers to store round-baled alfalfa,  sorghum, and
other forage in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) storage bags. The round bale Flex-a-Tubers(R)
are made in two sizes to permit the bagging of 4 and 5 foot bales. The bales can
be stored in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags up to 200 feet in length. In 2002,
the Company began manufacturing this line of equipment on a made-to-order basis.

     The Company assembles and sells a separate line of related equipment called
the Square Bale Bagger, which retails for approximately  $23,500 to $31,000. The
Square Bale Bagger permits farmers to store square bales of alfalfa, sorghum and
other forage, two bales high in Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) flex storage bags. The Square
Bale Bagger permits the bagging of the bales in Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R) flex storage
bags of 7 to 10 feet in  diameter  and up to 200 feet in  length.  Beginning  in
2002, the Company began  manufacturing this line of equipment on a made-to-order
basis.

     The Company assembles and sells the Ag-Bag(R) Pro-Grain Bagger, which
retails for approximately $33,500. This machine is similar in design to the
smallest Ag-Bagger(R) machines but has been adapted to permit the storage of
grains, such as corn, rice, wheat and soybeans, as well as other products, in
Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) storage bags. The machine permits the grain to be bagged
without damaging the kernel. After the grain is bagged and sealed, it will
retain the necessary quality for human consumption.

     The Company also  assembles  and sells the Mighty  Bite(R)  front-end  load
bucket.   This   revolutionary   bucket   replaces  the   conventional   bucket.
Hydraulically  operated, the Mighty Bite(R) closes tightly around material, thus
eliminating spillage and increasing load capacity due to compaction. The Company
manufactures the

                                        5
<PAGE>
Mighty Bite(R) in sizes ranging from one-half cubic yard to two cubic yards with
a retail price ranging from $3,300 to $4,900.

     The Company adapted its Ag-Bag(R)  bagging  machines for use in large-scale
"in-vessel"  composting  of  organic  matter.  The  bagging  machine  is used in
conjunction with a shredder that shreds the organic material,  which is then fed
into  the  bagging  machine  that  bags  the  compostable   matter  into  Ag-Bag
Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags.  An air blower is attached to the bag and  circulates
air through the bag during the composting process. The Ag-Bag(R) compost bagging
machines retail for between $52,500 to $137,000.

     Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) Storage Bags. The Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R)  disposable storage
bags range in size from 8 to 14 feet in  diameter  and 100 to 500 feet in length
and are made of  extruded  plastic.  Rolls of plastic  are  manufactured  to the
Company's  specifications.  The plastic contains special  stabilizers to protect
the bags from deterioration due to exposure to weather and the sun's ultraviolet
rays.  Once a  Tri-Dura(R)  bag is used,  it may be  recycled  or disposed of in
another manner, but may not be reused.

     The  Company  contracts  for the  manufacture  of,  and  sells  Tri-Dura(R)
three-ply bags with a white exterior and black interior  intended for storage of
silage up to 24 months.  The retail price of the bags ranges from  approximately
$136 to $2,150.  The  manufactured  plastic  rolls are shipped to the  Company's
plant in Blair,  Nebraska,  where  they are  folded  and  packed  for sale using
proprietary  folding  techniques.  The proprietary bag folding techniques reduce
bag folding time and allow the bags to uniformly unfold when being filled, which
thereby reduces operational delays.
     Ag-Bag(R)  Inoculant.  The  Company  markets a liquid  inoculant  and a dry
powder inoculant under the trade name Ag-Bag Plus!(R). The inoculant is added to
the  forage  or the  round or square  bales  during  bagging.  It  enhances  the
fermentation  process  for  making  silage in bags,  bunkers,  pits and silos by
substantially  shortening the time  necessary for the creation of the silage.  A
liquid inoculant was developed in 1989 by a Company supplier and introduced into
the market in 1990.  The dry inoculant is produced  from a  proprietary  formula
owned by the  Company  and  developed  by Larry R. Inman and Walter L. Jay.  See
"Executive  Officers of the  Registrant."  The Company also markets an inoculant
designed specifically for composting.

MARKET SIZE
-----------

     The market  for  Ag-Bag(R)  machinery  and  Ag-Bag  Tri-Dura(R)  recyclable
storage  bags is primarily  in the dairy and beef cattle  industries.  Silage is
used most often as dairy and beef animal  feed.  It is also used by farmers to a
lesser  extent to feed hogs and sheep.  In 2002,  over 250 million tons of corn,
alfalfa,  sorghum,  silage,  and hay were  harvested  by United  States  farmers
according to the AG IQ Handbook XX published in 2003 by Agricom,  Inc.  (the "AG
Handbook").  Based  on 2000  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA)
statistics,  the Company estimates that there are approximately 105,000 dairies,
and 150,000  beef,  hog, and sheep farms in the United States that are potential
customers for Ag-Bag(R)  farm equipment and  Tri-Dura(R)  storage bags; and that
only  about  8-12% of this group are  actually  using  storage  bags made by the
Company or its  competitors.  It  further  estimates  that  about  50-55% of the
bagging  industry  customers  purchase silage storage bags from the Company.  In
addition to the U.S., the Company  believes there is a large  population of such
farms in Canada,  Latin  America,  Western and Central  Europe,  Australia,  New
Zealand,  and Asia,  where the  Company  currently  sells  and  distributes  its
products,  and there is a large  potential  market in other countries into which
the Company may expand.

     The  Company  also  markets a system for  "in-vessel"  composting  which is
designed to  eliminate  odors and control  leachate  inherent  with  composting.
Composting is an alternative for disposing of or eliminating the large number of
organics  from  landfills.  The Company's  primary  focus is currently  directed
towards  municipalities,  private  composters,  military  bases,  zoos  and  the
Company's dairy and beef customers.  The Company currently estimates the size of
the compost  market  within  North  America to be over $2 billion a year.

                                        6
<PAGE>
Until further marketing efforts are made outside North America, the Company
cannot estimate with any certainty the foreign market size. However, the Company
believes that there is a large potential market in other countries into which it
may expand. No assurance can be given that the "in-vessel" composting system
will be accepted in either the domestic or foreign marketplace.

MARKETING
---------

     The Company markets its Ag-Bag(R) farm equipment, Tri-Dura(R) storage bags,
Ag-Bag  Plus!(R)  and other  inoculants  primarily  through a network  of United
States, Canadian, and international dealers. As of December 31, 2003, there were
62  dealers  serviced  by a  combined  total  of  16  regional  and  territorial
Company-employed  managers and sales support  coordinators.  Most of the dealers
market the entire Ag-Bag(R) line of farm equipment and products;  however,  some
dealers  sell  only  the farm  equipment  and  others  sell  only the  Ag-Bag(R)
inoculants. The Company also sells farm equipment, Tri-Dura(R) storage bags, and
inoculant  directly  to large  customers  in  states  where  there are no nearby
Ag-Bag(R)  dealers.  Beginning in 2002, the Company began focusing its marketing
efforts more on dealer  development and expanding its dealer network rather than
a focus towards direct selling.  In September  2002, the Company  introduced its
new pre-season ordering program for its products,  whereby the Company's dealers
place their next  year's  annual  product  requirements  order in advance.  As a
result of this program's  success,  the Company  continued the Pre-Season  Order
Program for its 2003-04 season with minor modifications.

     The Company  offers  customers the  opportunity  to finance the purchase of
Ag-Bag(R)  farm  equipment   through   unaffiliated   third  parties  who  offer
lease-purchase and wholesale financing.

     The  Company  also  rents used  Ag-Bag(R)  bagging  machines  to farmers in
various areas of the United States.  The rental charge is based on the number of
bags purchased and filled with forage.

     Prior to December 31, 1997, the Company  offered a custom  bagging  service
through its subsidiary Ag-Bag Europe PLC in the United Kingdom. The Company sold
its subsidiary that had not been performing at a profitable level due to the BSE
(Mad Cow) problem within the British farming industry on December 31, 1997.

     In late 2003, BSE (Mad Cow) was discovered in the United States. Based upon
the quick  response of the USDA and their findings to date, the Company does not
feel that BSE (Mad Cow) will  impact  its  operations  as its  customer  base is
largely focused on dairy farming rather than the beef industry.

     The Company markets its composting  system through a sublicense that allows
the end user to use the  Ag-Bag(R)  compost  technology.  The  Company  plans to
establish a composting  dealer  network and develop a regional  and  territorial
sales force that will have expertise in  composting.  The timing for these plans
will depend on the pace of market acceptance of the Company's composting system.

     The Company is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers. The
loss of any  single  customer  would not have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's financial condition or results of operations.

ASSEMBLY AND MANUFACTURING
--------------------------

     Ag-Bag(R) Farm  Equipment.  The Company buys some of its components for its
bagging  machines  from  various   manufacturers,   manufactures  the  remaining
components,  and  assembles  the  machines  itself.  The medium and large  sized
machines,  composting  machines,  HYPAC(R)  (cable-less)  machines,  Square Bale
Baggers, and  Flex-a-Tubers(R)  are all assembled at the Company's  headquarters
facility  in  Warrenton,  Oregon.  The smaller  machines  are  assembled  at the
Company's Blair, Nebraska plant. In 1999, the Company licensed its German dealer
to manufacture bagging machines for distribution within Europe.

     The Company  assembles  all of its machines in order to better  control the
quality of the farm  equipment.  This method  also  permits the Company to offer
customized  assembly for the end user of its equipment.  The Company can acquire
and install name brand manufactured components specified by the customer in lieu
of those ordinarily installed by the Company.

     Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R)  Storage Bags. All of the three-ply  Tri-Dura(R) storage
bags are  manufactured  for the Company by a single  manufacturer.  The bags are
manufactured  to the Company's  specifications  using a stabilizer that protects
the  plastic  from  becoming  brittle  due to  exposure to weather and the sun's
ultraviolet  light  rays.  The  Tri-Dura(R)  plastic  bags are  made in  various
diameters based on bag orders  received by the Company.  The bags are shipped in
roll form to the Company's plant in Blair,  Nebraska,  where they are folded and
packaged for shipment.

     Ag-Bag(R)  Inoculants.  The Company purchases on the open market the liquid
and  compost  inoculant.  The  Company  believes  that the  liquid  and  compost
inoculant  will be reasonably  available for purchase on the open market for the
foreseeable  future.  The dry inoculant is produced by the Company at the Blair,
Nebraska  plant  pursuant  to a  proprietary  formula  owned by the  Company and
developed  by Larry R. Inman and Walter L. Jay. See  "Executive  Officers of the
Registrant."

PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS
-------------------------------------

     The Company  purchases its Tri-Dura(R) rolls from a company partially owned
by Steven G. Ross ("Supplier") pursuant to a supply agreement. Steven G. Ross is
a 14.9%  stockholder  in the Company and owner of a company which  competes with
the Company's  Tri-Dura(R) bags. The supply agreement  provides that the Company
purchase  all of its plastic  rolls,  with  certain  exceptions,  from  Supplier
through at least December 31, 2007.  Thereafter,  either the Company or Supplier
may terminate the Supply  Agreement  upon two years' prior written  notice.  The
Company may purchase  plastic rolls from other  suppliers to the extent Supplier
is unable to supply plastic rolls under the Supply Agreement.  The Company has a
good relationship with Supplier,  and there are alternative  suppliers available
in the event Supplier is unable to provide rolls.

     Several  manufacturing  companies  manufacture the structural components of
the Company's  farm and composting  equipment in Oregon,  Nebraska and Iowa. The
Company  believes that  alternative  sources of supply are readily  available at
competitive  prices if the present sources of supply should become  unavailable.
The Company is not aware of any raw  materials  shortages or problems with these
suppliers that would adversely affect the Company's operations.

     The Company mixes the dry  inoculant at its Blair,  Nebraska  facility.  It
purchases the ingredients for the dry inoculant from a variety of suppliers. The
Company  purchases the liquid and compost  inoculant from a supplier,  who mixes
the inoculants to the Company's  specifications.  The Company believes there are
various other alternative sources of supply.

COMPETITION
-----------

     As the Company's  corporate  slogan,  the "Complete 1(R),"  indicates,  the
Company  believes  it is the  industry  leader  in the  manufacture  and sale of
complete  sealed feed farm  bagging  systems.  Ag-Bag is the only  company  that
manufactures the full line of equipment,  bags, and other accessories for sealed
feed farm management.  There are three competitors within the United States that
manufacture  similar  silage  bagging  machines.  There  are  also a  number  of
competitors  that  manufacture  bale wrapping  machines,  which compete with the
Company's Flex-a-Tuber(R).  The Company distinguishes itself in the market place
from other  manufacturers  by providing a top quality  product,  better warranty
protection, and customer service.

     The bag  market is highly  competitive.  The  Company  competes  in the bag
market by  providing  what the  Company  believes  to be a superior  product and
better warranty protection at a competitive price. The Company is also offering,
through central pickup and fixed locations in selected  geographic  areas of the
U.S., a recycling service for used Ag-Bag Tri-Dura(R) bags.

     The Company also competes with companies constructing bunkers and pits and,
to a lesser extent,  silos.  These competitors are mostly smaller companies that
build the  bunkers  and pits for the  farmer,  which the farmer  then fills with
forage using  available or rented farm  equipment  otherwise used in the farming
operation.  While these methods do not require bags or special equipment to fill
the  bags,  the  use of  these  alternatives  involves  a  significant  loss  of
flexibility  in storing  and  harvesting  the feed and an  overall  loss of feed
quality.  Flexibility is lost since  structures  must be permanently  placed and
significant capital  requirements are necessary to expand them. The feed quality
is inferior because of the amount of oxygen remaining after the forage is placed
in the pits or bunkers.

     The  Company  competes  primarily  with  windrow  turner  manufacturers  in
composting.  Windrow turners compost by turning and watering static piles weekly
and require  containment  of odor and leachate.  These turners are comparable in
price to the Company's  compost  machines.  However,  the  Company's  composting
systems  offer the  advantage of being  self-contained,  thus  reducing odor and
requiring no turning or watering.  There are  approximately  50 manufacturers of
turners. In addition to the windrow turner  manufacturers,  the Company competes
with several companies that manufacture "in-vessel" systems, such as burners and
incinerators for large projects, which generally cost from $1.1 to $15 million.

     In addition to the current competition,  national competitors may emerge if
the bagging  equipment and storage bag markets continue to grow. These potential
competitors   include   large   farm   equipment   manufacturers,   large   farm
co-operatives,  and large chemical companies who might decide to manufacture and
sell the storage bags.

     The  Company  competes  in its product  markets  primarily  on the basis of
product  quality,  warranty  protection,  and  customer  service.  Some  of  its
competitors are larger and have greater  financial,  marketing,  technical,  and
other resources than the Company.

BACKLOG
-------

     The dollar amount of backlog  orders of the Company that are believed to be
firm as of March 1, 2004, was approximately $9,300,000,  compared to $12,400,000
on March 1,  2003,  a 25 %  decrease.  Backlog  for 2004 is lower than 2003 as a
result of the depressed U.S. milk prices.  Under the Company's  pre-season order
program,   the  Company's   dealers  place  their  next  year's  annual  product
requirements  order in advance by each October 31st.  Due to the depressed  U.S.
milk prices during 2003,  dealers did not sell out of all their 2002  pre-season
ordered product and consequently were conservative with their 2003-04 pre-season
orders.  The  Company  introduced  this new  program in  September  2002 for the
2002-03-ordering  season and  continued  the program  for the  2003-04  ordering
season as well. (See "Seasonal Nature of Business") Backlog, however, may not be
a  meaningful  indicator  of future  sales.  This  backlog  is  seasonal  and is
reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
------------------------

     During 2003, the Company focused  research and development  expenditures on
testing a newer design of its larger-sized  silage-bagging  machine, in addition
to further  compost  machine  modification  and  development.  The Company  also
completed  research  on various  projects  undertaken  regarding  new silage and
nutritional studies of bagged feed and their effects on animal production during
the year. The Company also  continues with ongoing  research and testing in this
area as well.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
---------------------

     Compliance with federal,  state and local laws and  regulations  regulating
the discharge of materials into the  environment,  or otherwise  relating to the
protection of the environment, had no material effect upon capital expenditures,
earnings, or competitive positions of the Company during the year ended December
31, 2003.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
----------------------

     The Company  has basic and  improvement  patents in the U.S.,  as well as a
number of patents pending, that encompass machines,  bags and systems for silage
bagging, grain bagging, and hay/straw bale bagging.  Corresponding  applications
have or will be filed in selected foreign  countries.  In addition,  proprietary
rights in the bagging of compost  have been and are being  developed  in the U.S
and in selected foreign countries.

     The Company's  patents on its basic  bagging  machine have been found to be
valid and have been  successfully  defended  in prior  litigation.  The  Company
believes  that it has  developed  its  position in the  industry  partially as a
result of  protection  provided  by these  patents.  The  Company  also owns the
proprietary  formula for making the dry inoculant  marketed under the trade name
Ag-Bag  Plus!(R),  which was developed by Larry R. Inman and Walter L. Jay. (See
"Executive Officers of the Registrant")

     The  names  Ag-Bag(R),  Ag-Bag  Plus!(R),   Bale-Bag(R),   Flex-a-Tuber(R),
Flex-a-Tube(R),  ABCTI System(R),  Mighty Bite(R),  Tri-Dura(R),  and the symbol
"AB"(R) are all  registered  as  trademarks  with the United  States  Patent and
Trademark Office.

     The Company believes that its color scheme and trademarks are well known in
the  industry,  are an important  part of its  business,  and give the Company a
competitive advantage.

EMPLOYEES
---------

     On December 31, 2003, the Company had 84 full-time  employees.  The Company
employs  approximately 110 people during its busy season.  None of the Company's
employees are represented by a union, and the Company believes that its employee
relations are good.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
-------------------

     In early 1990, the Company began  occupying its 30,000 square foot facility
located in Warrenton, Oregon. This facility serves as a warehouse and houses the
major  portion of its silage  bagging  equipment  manufacturing.  The  Company's
administrative  offices are also located  there.  Management  estimates that the
manufacturing  at the  Warrenton  plant is  currently  at  approximately  65% of
capacity.  The Company  occupies  the land  pursuant to a lease that  expires in
2015.

     The Company owns facilities in Blair,  Nebraska,  where the Company:  folds
and  packages  its  Tri-Dura(R)  feed  storage  bags;  prepares and packages its
proprietary   inoculant;   and,  assembles  its  smaller  bagging  machines  and
warehouses  products.  The Blair,  Nebraska facility consists of three buildings
comprising   approximately   70,000  square  feet.   Management  estimates  that
manufacturing  at the Blair  facility is  currently at  approximately  65-70% of
capacity.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
--------------------------

     The Company is a defendant in alleged patent infringement  lawsuits,  Versa
Corporation v. Ag-Bag  International  Ltd., filed October 30, 2000 and March 19,
2003 in the United States  District Court for the District of Oregon.  The claim
alleges patent infringement upon Versa's U.S. Patent Nos. 5,799,472;  5,894,713;
5,345,744;  5,426,910;  RE38020 and  5,452,562  relating  to a bag pan,  density
control  and  adjustable  anchor wing patent for an  agricultural  feed  bagging
machine and composting  method  patents.  Plaintiff seeks monetary  damages.  On
February 6, 2004,  the bag pan,  density  control and  composting  method patent
matters  were  settled  and the  cases  dismissed  in  their  entirety,  thereby
concluding  these three matters.  On January 28, 2004,  the court ruled,  in the
remaining  adjustable  anchor wing  patent  matter,  that the  Company  does not
infringe upon Versa's RE38020 patent.  The Company  previously filed for summary
judgment for  non-infringement  of Versa's patent and filed a motion for summary
judgment for Versa's  patent  invalidity of the RE38020  patent.  This matter is
currently pending before the court. The Company believes that the outcome of the
litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or
results of operations.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
------------------------------------------------------------

     During the fourth  quarter of 2003, no matters were  submitted to a vote of
security holders.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The Company's  Common Stock began trading publicly on January 17, 1990,
and was  approved for  quotation  on Nasdaq on April 24, 1990,  under the symbol
"AGBG." In 1997, the Nasdaq listing  requirements were  substantially  expanded.
The Company does not  currently  qualify under the more  stringent  requirements
because the price at which its Common Stock is trading is below the $1 per share
minimum.  The Company was formally  notified on January 13, 1999 that its Common
Stock was delisted from quotation on The Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market for failure to
meet the new listing  requirements.  The Company's Common Stock is now quoted on
the OTC Bulletin Board.

         As of March 1, 2004, there were  approximately 331 holders of record of
the Company's Common Stock. The Company estimates there are approximately  1,300
beneficial holders of the Company's Common Stock. The following table sets forth
the  range of high and low bid  prices  of the  Company's  Common  Stock for the
quarters  indicated  through  the fourth  quarter of 2003 as reported on the OTC
Bulletin Board:

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
----------------------------

     The Company's  significant  accounting  policies are described in Note 1 to
the  financial  statements  included  in Item 15 of this form 10-K.  The Company
believes its most critical  accounting  policies include inventory  obsolescence
reserves,  allowance for doubtful  accounts,  accounting for warranty  reserves,
accounting for pre-season order flooring interest,  recourse obligation reserves
and accounting for income taxes.

      The $1,021,322 estimate for inventory  obsolescence reserves was developed
using  inventory-aging  reports for finished  goods,  combined  with  historical
usage, and forecasted usage and inventory shelf life. The Company's estimates of
market value incorporate projections of future sales volume by product class. In
estimating  the market  value of parts  inventory  items,  the  Company  reviews
current  inventory  levels  in  relation  to sales  forecasts  and  adjusts  the
valuation reserve accordingly.  For the remaining  categories of inventory,  the
Company  establishes  a  reserve  balance  based on the  aging  of the  specific
inventory items. As trends in these variables change, the percentages applied to
the inventory aging categories are updated.

     The $204,081  estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised of a
specific account  analysis which addresses  accounts over 90 days past due and a
general  reserve  of  $10,000,  which is  deemed  appropriate  for the  level of
receivables  carried  by  the  Company.   Accounts  where  specific  information
indicates a potential loss may exist are reviewed and a specific reserve against
amounts due is  recorded.  As  additional  information  becomes  available  such
specific  account  reserves  are  updated.  Additionally,  a general  reserve is
applied based upon historical collection and write-off experience.  As trends in
historical collection and write-offs change, the general reserve is updated.

-----------------------
(1) Includes deferred taxes.
(2) Includes loans from shareholders and deferred taxes.
(3) Includes $696 of preferred stock.

     The $74,453  estimate  for  warranty  reserve is  developed  based upon the
estimated  future costs to be incurred  under the  provisions  of the  Company's
warranty agreements on its bags and machines. The Company

                                       17
<PAGE>
reviews its  historical  warranty  expense and current  sales trends in specific
products  covered  under  warranty  and  reserves are updated as trends in these
variables change.

     The  Company  estimates  the future  interest  that will be incurred by the
Company associated with current sales under its dealer pre-season order program.
At the time of sale,  the Company  reduces sales revenue and accrues a liability
for the estimated future interest  obligation.  The Company estimates its future
interest  obligation  pursuant to the terms of its pre-season  order program and
the shipping  periods  defined  therein.  The Company  estimates  that machinery
shipped  between  October and May of each year, will be sold at the dealer level
by the end of May and accrues an estimated future interest liability accordingly
(ranging  from 30 to 210 days).  For  machinery  shipped  after May, the Company
estimates  (since  bagging  season is in full swing) that it will incur interest
for approximately 30 days, and accrues an estimated liability  accordingly.  For
all other products,  the company accrues an estimated future interest  liability
(ranging  from 30 to 180 days) under the  assumptions  that the product  will be
sold at the  dealer  level  by the end of the  respective  shipping  periods  as
defined in the pre-season  order program.  For additional  products  ordered and
shipped outside the defined shipping  periods,  the Company accrues an estimated
future  interest  liability of  approximately  30 days,  which  according to the
pre-season order program, the Company pays interest through the end of the month
of  shipment.  The Company had accrued an estimated  liability of $73,266  under
this program at December 31, 2003.

     The Company  periodically  assigns some of its trade accounts receivable to
various  third-party  financing sources.  These accounts can be assigned with or
without  recourse  depending  on the  specific  accounts  assigned.  The Company
reviews on a monthly basis,  those accounts  assigned with recourse to determine
their payment history with the third-party financing source and estimates if any
accrual is necessary for potential future recourse obligations.  At December 31,
2003, the balance of assigned accounts with recourse was $3,155,990. The Company
has  determined,  that at  December  31,  2003,  no accrual  was  necessary  for
potential future recourse obligations with its third-party financing sources.

      The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  under the asset and  liability
method.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized for the future tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected  to apply to  taxable  income  in the  years in which  those  temporary
differences  are expected to be recovered or settled.  Valuation  allowances are
established to reduce potential  deferred tax assets when it is more likely than
not that all or some  portion  of  potential  deferred  tax  assets  will not be
realized.  The Company has established a $1,577,772  valuation allowance against
its tax assets as of December 31, 2003.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002
--------------------------------------

         For the year ended  December 31, 2003,  net sales  decreased  20.91% to
$21,502,654  compared to $27,189,140 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Sales
were down for the year as a result of the slow U.S. farm economy which  resulted
from the lowest U.S.  milk  prices  seen since 2000.  Milk prices were at record
lows  for the  first  half of the year and saw  some  improvement  in the  third
quarter of 2003,  but began to fall off again during the fourth quarter of 2003.
The outlook for 2004 indicates that milk prices will remain above the record low
levels seen during early 2003 of $9.11 and are  anticipated to reach the $14-$15
range over the summer of 2004.  Farmers began seeing  increases in their monthly
milk checks during the third quarter of 2003, but continued to remain  cautious,
despite continued low interest rates, on increasing their capital  expenditures.
Management believes that once sustained,  prolonged upward movement in U.S. milk
prices are seen, farmers will be able to repay their existing  obligations which
mounted  from  the  persistently  low milk  prices  over  the  last  year.  Also
contributing  to the decline was  continued  tightening in  agricultural  credit
availability, as a result of the depressed U.S. milk prices, coupled with rising
supplemental grain feed costs brought on by the summer drought conditions in the
U.S.. In addition,  increased  volume discounts from the  implementation  of the
Company's  pre-season order program coupled with continued strong competition in
the silage bag market,  as farmers  look for the most  economically  priced bag,
without considering quality and customer service, contributed to the decline.

      Machine  sale  revenue for the year  declined  23.55% and bag sale revenue
declined 17.15% compared to 2002.  Machine sale revenue for the year declined as
a  result  of the  U.S.  milk  price  and farm  economic  conditions  previously
discussed.  As a percentage of total revenue for the year 2003,  machine revenue
declined 3% and bag revenue  increased  1%. (See "Item 1.  Business - General.")

      Machine  sales are directly tied to farmers'  income and  therefore  their
ability to purchase new equipment. The total number of bagging machines that are
in the marketplace drives the Company's bag and parts sales.  However,  there is
not a perfect  correlation between the Company's bag sales and machine sales, as
the Company's and competitors' bags are interchangeable on all bagging machinery
in the industry. The Company cannot estimate with any certainty the total number
of machines or bags used in the industry.

      For the year ended  December  31, 2003,  the Company  sold two  composting
systems in addition to compost bag sales,  generating  approximately $524,000 in
revenue,  compared to four systems sold and compost bag sales for the year ended
December 31, 2002, generating  approximately $592,000 in revenue.  Compost sales
were  down for the year as a result of  current  economic  conditions  and tight
budgetary constraints for the Company's potential end users in the U.S.

     Although  the  Company  sells its  products  primarily  through a worldwide
dealer network, certain sales are made directly to large volume customers when a
dealer is not present in the customer's  geographic market. For each of the last
three years,  the Company  estimates that direct sales make up between 30-35% of
total  sales.  The gross  margin  realized  on the  Company's  direct  sales are
typically  within 1-3% of those sales  realized  through  the  Company's  dealer
network.  However, various economic, volume and market factors in the geographic
area impact the ultimate margin. The Company  anticipates its sales mix to begin
to favor  more  dealer  sales in the  future as a result of its  change of sales
focus during the later half of 2002. (See "Item 1. Business - Marketing.")

      International  sales for the  Company in 2003 were down in  comparison  to
2002 as a result of drought  weather  conditions  in  international  dairy areas
where the  Company  has a large  portion  of its  international  customer  base,
coupled with continued  economic  uncertainty  affecting the international  farm
economy,  resulting largely from BSE (mad cow) concerns.  International sales to
Germany  remained  constant  compared to the prior year. In 1999,  the Company's
German dealer began manufacturing  mid-sized bagging machines in Germany under a
license  from the  Company.  Therefore,  the Company no longer  sells  mid-sized
machines directly to its German dealer.  Instead, the Company receives a royalty
fee for each mid-sized  machine sold by its German dealer,  which is recorded as
other income.  In 1997,  the Company  formed a German joint venture in which the
Company owns a 50% interest and its German  dealer owns the  remaining  50%. The
joint venture distributes bags to the Company's German and European dealers. The
Company's  earnings  from the joint venture are reported as other income and are
accounted for using the equity method.  Approximately  $4.7 million in bag sales
and service were  distributed  through the venture  during 2003,  an increase of
27%, compared to approximately $3.7 million in bag sales and service for 2002.

     Gross profit as a percentage of sales  decreased  21.51% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to 2002.  The decrease for the year was the result of
lower  sales  volumes to cover fixed  operating  overheads,  coupled  with lower
margins on the  Company's  used  equipment  sold  during the year and  increases
incurred in the Company's inventory reserves.  The decrease was partially offset
by improved  margins on the  Company's  "core"  smaller  bagging  machines  from
production improvements made during 2002, in addition to lower warranty costs as
a result of the Company  passing on more of its warranty costs to its suppliers,
coupled with lower freight costs for the year resulting largely from the Company
streamlining its warehouse  locations  during 2002 to help in improving  overall
margins.   (See  "Item  1.  Business  -  Farm  Equipment  and  Products.")  Also
contributing  to the decline  for the year was an  increase in volume  discounts
(which  are  recorded  as  a  reduction   in  net  sales)  from  the   Company's
implementation of its pre-season order program,  as 2003 was the first full year
for this program and the related discount.

      Selling  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased 24.82% to
$2,628,971  compared to  $3,496,672  for the year ended  December 31, 2002.  The
decrease in selling  expenses  for the year was the result of lower  commissions
and  third  party  financing  fees  from  lower  sales  volumes,  lower  overall
advertising  costs,  coupled  with lower  personnel,  benefit,  and travel costs
associated with sales personnel  reductions made in late 2002 in connection with
the shift more towards selling through the Company's  dealer network,  partially
offset by increased dealer incentive costs.

      Administrative  expenses for the year ended  December  31, 2003  increased
2.59% to $2,810,904 compared to $2,739,811 for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The  increase  for the year was the result of  increased  insurance  expense and
higher   professional  fees  related  to  public  company  compliance  with  the
Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002, in addition to slightly higher patent costs,  which
were  partially  offset by lower bad debt,  general  office  and  administrative
personnel expenses.

     During the year ended December 31, 2003,  the Company  recorded a gain from
the sale of assets of  $185,358.  The gain  largely  resulted  from  depreciated
folding  equipment  that was sold to its German joint venture  during the second
quarter of 2003,  in  addition  to the sale of fully  depreciated  miscellaneous
manufacturing  equipment and vehicles which occurred during the third quarter of
2003.  During the second quarter of 2003,  the Company  recorded a gain from the
sale of assets of $345,837.  However, under the equity method of accounting with
the Company's 50% ownership in the German joint venture,  the Company's share of
the gain of $172,918  was deferred  and will be  recognized  as the German joint
venture  depreciates the folding equipment over its useful life. During the year
ended  December 31, 2003,  $86,454 of the deferred gain was  recognized as joint
venture income.

      Research and  development  expenses  for the year ended  December 31, 2003
decreased  36.74% to $139,160  compared to $219,980 for the year ended  December
31, 2002. The decrease in research and development expenses for the year was the
result of completed research on various projects undertaken

                                       21
<PAGE>
regarding new silage and nutritional studies of bagged feed and their effects on
animal  production,  offset by  continued  research  and testing in this area as
well.  Additionally,  the Company  continued  testing on the newer design of the
Company's larger-sized silage-bagging machines, and compost machine modification
and development.

     Interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased  21.78% to
$245,656 compared to $314,068 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease
for the year was the result of the Company  utilizing a smaller credit  facility
as a result of the Company  changing its  collection  methods  during the fourth
quarter of 2002  whereby the  Company's  customers  no longer have open  account
terms,  which was partially  offset by increased  interest rates on the facility
during the year.  The Company's  customers now have the option to pay in advance
for their order,  utilize their own  established  credit,  or utilize one of the
Company's third-party financing sources or programs offered for their purchases.

      Joint venture  equity and royalty  income for the year ended  December 31,
2003  increased  34.23% to  $423,074  compared  to  $315,196  for the year ended
December 31, 2002. The increase for the year was the result of increased  income
from the joint venture as a result of the  recognition  of deferred  folder sale
gain (see discussion of gain from sale of assets above),  coupled with a special
one-time folding royalty received from the Company's joint venture upon the sale
of the folding  equipment to the joint venture which occurred  during the second
quarter of 2003. (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.")

     The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was
41%. The effective tax rate was an expense during the year due to the fact the
Company established a $1,577,772 valuation allowance against its deferred tax
assets in respect to the Company's ability to utilize its Net Operating Loss
carryforwards and research tax credits, which was offset by the fact the
Company's income from its German joint venture is not taxable in the United
States, and the extraterritorial income exclusion provisions of the current
United States tax code.

      Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $2,753,715 compared to a
net loss of $663,988 for the year ended  December 31, 2002. The net loss for the
year was the  result  of lower  sales  and gross  margins,  lower  miscellaneous
income,  increased  administrative expenses, and the establishment of a deferred
tax  valuation  allowance  on its  deferred  tax  assets,  partially  offset  by
decreased selling, research and development, and interest expenses and increased
joint venture equity and royalty income and gain from the sale of assets.


YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001
--------------------------------------

      For the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  net  sales  decreased  5.29% to
$27,189,140  compared to $28,708,233 for the year ended December 31, 2001. Sales
were down for the year as a result of drought weather conditions  experienced in
much of the Midwest and upper-Midwestern  United States that greatly reduced the
summer alfalfa harvest for 2002. Additionally, milk prices continued their steep
decline,  which began during the second  quarter of 2002,  to record low levels,
causing  farmers  to become  cautious  on  purchasing  capital  equipment.  Also
contributing  to the decline was  continued  tightening in  agricultural
credit availability, as a result of the depressed U.S. milk prices, coupled with
rising supplemental grain feed costs during the third quarter of 2002 brought on
by the drought conditions in the U.S.

     This is a shift from the positive trends that could be seen moving into the
first quarter of 2002.  These positive trends included  stabilizing milk prices,
continued  optimism  that milk prices in the U.S.  would remain above the record
low levels of the year 2000  throughout  2002 and continued  easing of credit by
financial  institutions  for the farming sector that,  coupled with the interest
rate  reductions  of 2001,  allowed  farmers  to be more  optimistic  and resume
capital  expenditures.  Sales were down for the year which began eroding  during
the second quarter and continued throughout the remainder of 2002.  Supplemental
grain feed costs  remained  low during  the first two  quarters  of 2002,  which

                                       22
<PAGE>
tended to improve the availability of farm operating funds.  However, this trend
reversed during the third quarter as discussed above.  Throughout  2002,  strong
competition  in the silage bag market  continued,  as farmers  look for the most
economical bag, with lesser  consideration to overall quality,  customer service
and recycling of the used plastic silage bags offered by the Company.

      Machine  sale  revenue for the year  declined  3.61% and bag sale  revenue
declined 5.54% compared to 2001. Machine sale revenue for the year declined as a
result of a decrease in the Company's  smaller unit bagging machine sales during
the second and third  quarters  of 2002  compared  to 2001,  resulting  from the
drought and milk price conditions previously discussed. As a percentage of total
revenue for the year 2002, machine and bag revenue was unchanged.  (See "Item 1.
Business - General.")  Machine  sales are directly  tied to farmers'  income and
therefore  their ability to purchase new equipment.  The total number of bagging
machines that are in the  marketplace  drives the Company's bag and parts sales.
However,  there is not a perfect correlation between the Company's bag sales and
machine sales, as the Company's and competitors' bags are interchangeable on all
bagging  machinery  in the  industry.  The  Company  cannot  estimate  with  any
certainty the total number of machines or bags used in the industry.

      For the year ended  December  31, 2002,  the Company sold four  composting
systems in addition to compost bag sales,  generating  approximately $592,000 in
revenue,  compared to ten systems  sold and compost bag sales for the year ended
December 31, 2001,  generating  approximately  $1.3 million in revenue.  Compost
sales  were down for the year as a result of  current  economic  conditions  and
tight budgetary constraints for the Company's potential end users in the U.S.

      Although  the Company  sells its  products  primarily  through a worldwide
dealer network, certain sales are made directly to large volume customers when a
dealer is not present in the customer's  geographic market. For each of the last
three years,  the Company  estimates that direct sales make up between 33-38% of
total  sales.  The gross  margin  realized  on the  Company's  direct  sales are
typically  within 1-3% of those sales  realized  through  the  Company's  dealer
network.  However, various economic, volume and market factors in the geographic
area impact the ultimate margin. The Company  anticipates its sales mix to begin
to favor  more  dealer  sales in the  future as a result of its  change of sales
focus during the later half of 2002. (See "Item 1. Business - Marketing.")

      The  Company  continued   evaluating  selling  its  bagging  machines  via
e-commerce and concluded that e-commerce is not currently a viable  distribution
avenue  for  its  machinery.   This  is  due  to  the  complexity  and  required
understanding  of the end user's  needs and farming  operation,  which  requires
discussion in an individual  setting with a Company  sales  representative.  The
Company  however,  will continue to evaluate  whether to offer some of its other
products via e-commerce at some point in the future.

     International sales for the Company in 2002 were down in comparison to 2001
due to continued economic uncertainty  affecting the international farm economy.
International  sales to Canada and Latin America saw a slight  increase in 2002,
while sales to Germany saw a decline for the year. In 1999, the Company's German
dealer began manufacturing mid-sized bagging machines in Germany under a license
from the  Company.  Therefore,  the Company no longer sells  mid-sized  machines
directly to its German dealer.  Instead,  the Company receives a royalty fee for
each  mid-sized  machine sold by its German  dealer,  which is recorded as other
income.  In 1997, the Company formed a German joint venture in which the Company
owns a 50%  interest  and its German  dealer owns the  remaining  50%. The joint
venture  distributes  bags to the  Company's  German and European  dealers.  The
Company's  earnings  from the joint venture are reported as other income and are
accounted for using the equity method.  Approximately  $3.7 million in bag sales
were distributed  through the venture during 2002, an increase of 12%,  compared
to approximately $3.3 million in bag sales for 2001.

      Gross profit as a percentage of sales  decreased  1.43% for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to 2001.  The decrease for the year was the result of
1) lower sales volumes to cover fixed  operating  overheads,  2)

                                       23
<PAGE>
higher  machine  warranty costs  (related  largely to the Company's  large-sized
bagging machines),  3) lower margins on the Company's used equipment sold during
the year,  and, 4) lower  margins on bags in certain  highly  competitive,  high
volume  geographic  areas. The decrease was partially offset by improved margins
on the Company's  "core" smaller bagging  machines from production  improvements
made during 2002.  Also  contributing to the decline for the year was the mix of
machine  models sold during the year,  which saw a 16% increase in unit sales of
the Company's  larger-sized  bagging  machines.  Larger-sized  bagging  machines
generate a lower  overall  margin for the  Company  than its "core"  small sized
bagging machine. (See "Item 1. Business - Farm Equipment and Products.")

      Selling  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased  1.61% to
$3,496,672  compared to  $3,441,197  for the year ended  December 31, 2001.  The
increase  for the year  was the  result  of  increased  advertising,  promotion,
meeting,  and  dealer  incentive  costs,  partially  offset by lower  personnel,
benefit,  and travel costs  associated with sales  personnel  reductions made in
2002 in  connection  with the shift more towards  selling  through the Company's
dealer  network  (See  "Item 1.  Business  -  Marketing."),  coupled  with lower
commissions from lower sales volumes for the year.

      Administrative  expenses for the year ended  December  31, 2002  increased
4.32% to $2,739,811 compared to $2,626,268 for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The increase for the year was the result of higher  professional fees related to
ongoing  patent  litigation  and  increases in  administrative  salary,  general
office,  annual  meeting and insurance  expense,  partially  offset by lower bad
debt, employee benefit, and director fee expenses.

      Research and  development  expenses  for the year ended  December 31, 2002
increased 2.91% to $219,980 compared to $213,757 for the year ended December 31,
2001.  The increase for the year was the result of new research and  development
on testing a newer design of the Company's larger-sized  silage-bagging machine,
in addition to further compost machine modification and development. The Company
also completed research on various projects undertaken  regarding new silage and
nutritional studies of bagged feed and their effects on animal production during
the year, and is continuing research and testing in this area as well.

      Interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased 11.70% to
$314,068 compared to $355,686 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease
for the year was the  result of lower  interest  rates on the  Company's  credit
line,  partially offset by the Company  utilizing a larger portion of its credit
facilities through the third quarter of 2002.

      Joint venture  equity and royalty  income for the year ended  December 31,
2002  increased  5.39% to  $315,196  compared  to  $299,065  for the year  ended
December 31, 2001.  The increase for the year was the result of increased  sales
from the joint venture during the year (see the  international  sales discussion
above) coupled with a slight increase in folding  royalties,  as plastic tonnage
folded in 2002 by the
German joint venture increased  approximately 12% from 2001 tonnage folded. (See
"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".)

      The Company's  effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
(45%). This was due to 1) the fact the Company incurred a net loss for the year,
2) the recognition of research and development  credits associated with its 2002
activities,  3) the fact the  Company's  income from its German joint venture is
not taxable in the United States, and 4) the  extraterritorial  income exclusion
provisions of the current United States tax code. In 2002, the Company generated
net general business tax credit benefits of approximately $9,000.

      Net loss for the year ended  December 31, 2002 was $663,988  compared to a
net loss of $164,150 for the year ended  December 31, 2001.  The decline for the
year  was  the  result  of  lower  sales,  lower  gross  profit  resulting  from
competition  and mix of bagging  machinery  sold during the year,  coupled  with
increased  selling,


                                       24
<PAGE>
administrative, and research expense, partially offset by higher income from the
Company's German joint venture and lower interest costs.


RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
--------------------------------

        In June 2003, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard  ("SFAS") No. 150,  "Accounting for
Certain  Financial  Instruments  with  Characteristics  of Both  Liabilities and
Equity." This  statement  establishes  standards  regarding  classification  and
measurement  of  certain  financial  instruments  with  characteristics  of both
liabilities and equity. It requires  financial  instruments  within the scope of
this  statement  to  be  classified  as   liabilities   (or  an  asset  in  some
circumstances).  Many of these financial  instruments were previously classified
as equity. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, and was otherwise effective at the beginning of the
first interim period  beginning  after June 15, 2003. For financial  instruments
created  before the issuance date of this  statement  and still  existing at the
beginning of the interim period of adoption, transition is achieved by reporting
the  cumulative  effect  of a change in an  accounting  principle  by  initially
measuring the financial  instruments at fair value.  Management  does not expect
that the  application  of the  provisions of this statement will have a material
impact on the Company's financial statements.

       In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,  "Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities."  This statement  amends and
clarifies  financial  accounting  and  reporting  for  derivative   instruments,
including  certain  derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts and for
hedging  activities under SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging Activities."  Management does not expect that the application of the
provisions  of this  statement  will have a  material  impact  on the  Company's
financial statements.

       In  January  2003,  the  FASB  issued  Interpretation  No.  46 (FIN  46),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation clarifies the
application  of Accounting  Research  Bulletin No. 51,  "Consolidated  Financial
Statements," and requires existing  unconsolidated variable interest entities to
be  consolidated  by  their  primary   beneficiaries  if  the  entities  do  not
effectively disperse risks among parties involved.  This interpretation explains
how to identify variable  interest  entities and how an enterprise  assesses its
interests in a variable  interest  entity to decide whether to consolidate  that
entity.  In December  2003,  FASB made revisions and delayed  implementation  of
certain  provisions of FIN 46. As a public entity that is not a "Small  Business
Issuer,"  the  Company  is now  required  to apply FIN 46 to all  unconsolidated
variable  interest  entities no later than March 31, 2004, with the exception of
unconsolidated special-purpose entities, which had an implementation deadline of
December 31, 2003.

Special-purpose  entities for this  provision  are expected to include  entities
whose  activities  are primarily  related to  securitizations  or other forms of
asset-backed  financings or single-lessee leasing  arrangements.  The Company is
associated with a potential variable interest entity through their investment in
BAW as described in Note 12 to the Financial  Statements.  Management determined
that BAW is a variable  interest  entity,  but concluded that the Company is not
the primary beneficiary.  Management does not expect that the application of the
provisions of this  interpretation  will have a material impact on the Company's
financial statements.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
-------------------------------

      The  seasonal  nature of the northern  hemisphere  farming  industry,  the
production  time for  equipment  and the time  required to prepare  bags for use
requires the Company to  manufacture  and carry high  inventories  to meet rapid
delivery  requirements.  In particular,  the Company must maintain a significant
level of bags during the spring and summer to meet the sales demands  during the
harvest  season.  The Company uses working  capital and trade credit to increase
its inventory so that it has sufficient  inventory

                                       25
<PAGE>
levels  available to meet its sales demands.  Although the Company's  pre-season
ordering program  provides it with some  flexibility in production,  the Company
must maintain adequate  inventory levels for those customers,  both old and new,
who order or re-order product outside of this program throughout the year.

      The Company  relies on its suppliers to provide trade credit to enable the
Company to build its inventory. The Company's suppliers have provided sufficient
trade  credit  to meet the  demand  to date and have been  flexible  with  their
payment terms (including extended payment arrangements)  provided to the Company
and management  believes this will continue.  However, no assurance can be given
that suppliers will continue to provide sufficient trade credit in the future.

     As a result of the Company  incurring net losses during the previous  three
years and its negative cash flows from operations for the current year, there is
uncertainty  about the  Company's  ability to continue as a going  concern.  The
Company's  management  believes the Company's weak  operating  results have been
primarily due to the depressed milk prices in the agriculture sector,  which has
a direct  impact  on the  disposable  income of its dairy  farm  customers,  who
account for 75% of the Company's  business.  The Company  further  believes that
dairy  farmers have been delaying or  eliminating  capital  expenditures  due to
their  uncertainties  regarding milk prices and their disposable  income.  Early
predictions for 2004 show milk prices significantly higher than the historically
low levels seen for many of the previous years and the Company expects operating
results to improve as dairy farmers  begin to see increases in their  disposable
income through stabilizing milk prices. The Company's management also feels that
dealers  have been  conservative  on their  pre-season  orders for  2003-04 as a
result of the prolonged,  depressed  milk price  situation.  It is  management's
feeling  that some  dealers  will have the need to re-order  additional  product
during the year as a result of the forecasted improving milk price, which should
help the  Company's  dealers sell out of their  remaining  inventories.  If this
happens,  there is a potential for higher gross margins for the Company,  as the
dealers would be re-ordering outside of the pre-season order program terms which
provide  for a lower  volume  discount  on their  re-orders.  (See  "Results  of
Operation" discussion.)

     To help  provide  positive  cash  flow  for  the  Company,  management  has
implemented an expense reduction plan. Specifically,  management has implemented
staff reductions and reduced salaries of senior management. Nonessential capital
expenditures,   travel  and  other  expenses  have  either  been  eliminated  or
postponed.  Management has also been considering  other changes to the Company's
business  model  such as  opportunities  to sell  the  business,  refinance  the
Warrenton,  Oregon  facility (which has only a small economic  development  loan
outstanding  against this  collateral),  consolidate or dispose of manufacturing
facilities  or other  tangible  or  intangible  assets,  including  selling  the
Company's 50% interest in its joint  venture,  or take out a policy loan against
the life  insurance  policies  currently  in force in which the  Company  is the
beneficiary.  However,  no  assurance  can be  given  that the  Company  will be
successful in accomplishing these objectives.

      Accounts  receivable  increased  5.82% at December 31, 2003 to  $1,226,390
compared to  $1,158,927  at December 31,  2002.  The increase for the year was a
result of several  large  machine  sales  occurring  during  December  where the
Company did not receive funding from its third party financing  sources prior to
the end of December.  The Company  received  payment during the first quarter of
2004. (See "Item 8. Financial  Statements and Supplementary  Data.") As a result
of the Company  changing its  collection  methods  during the fourth  quarter of
2002,  whereby the Company's  customers no longer have open account  terms,  the
Company generally receives funding from its third party financing sources within
10 days of invoice processing.  For new purchases,  the Company's customers have
the option to pay in advance  for their  order,  utilize  their own  established
credit,  or  utilize  one of the  Company's  third-party  financing  sources  or
programs  offered for their  purchases.  The Company  has  established  adequate
reserves  ($204,081  at December  31, 2003  compared to $203,595 at December 31,
2002)  against  accounts  receivable  in the event  that  some of the  remaining
accounts become uncollectible.

      The Company relies on its third-party  financing  sources and the dealers'
own  established  credit  with their  local  banks,  to provide  funding for the
Company's  dealers and retail customers for their purchases under the pre-season
order program.  The Company's third party  financing  sources and dealers' local
banks

                                       26
<PAGE>
have provided  sufficient  credit to the Company's dealers to date for the
Company to obtain payment for their purchases and management  believes this will
continue.  However,  no assurance  can be given that the  Company's  third-party
financing  sources and dealers' local banks will continue to provide the Company
with dealer and end user financing programs designed for the Company.

      Inventory  decreased 4.47% at December 31, 2003 to $5,781,345  compared to
$6,051,720  at December 31, 2002.  The decrease in inventory  resulted  from the
Company's  continued  efforts to streamline its inventory and more closely match
its  production  with  planned  inventory  requirements.  Contributing  to these
efforts was the  implementation  of the Company's  pre-season  ordering  program
introduced in September 2002 for the 2002-03 season which the Company  continued
in October 2003 for the 2003-04 season. (See Item 1.
 "Business - Marketing.")

      Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 26.61% at December 31,
2003 to $251,808 compared to $198,877 at December 31, 2002. The increase was the
result of an increase in trade show deposits and prepaid insurance expense.

      Deferred  income taxes  decreased to $-0- at December 31, 2003 compared to
$1,013,000  at December  31,  2002.  The  decrease was the result of the Company
establishing a valuation allowance of $1,577,772 against its deferred tax assets
during 2003.

      Intangible  assets at December 31, 2003  increased to $15,066  compared to
$11,511 at  December  31,  2002.  The  increase  was the  result of new  patents
developed  on  the  Company's  bagging  machine  technology,  offset  by  normal
amortization expense.

     The BAW joint  venture  asset  decreased  to $376,974 at December  31, 2003
compared to $397,938 at December  31,  2002.  The decrease was the result of the
deferred gain under the equity method of accounting,  of the Company's  share of
gain from the sale of folding  equipment sold to the German joint venture in the
second  quarter of 2003,  which was offset by the Company's  share of income for
the year. During the year ended December 31, 2003,  $86,454 of deferred gain was
recognized.

      Other  assets  were flat at  December  31,  2003 at  $491,513  compared to
$490,628 on December 31, 2002.

     The  Company  has a  revolving  operating  line of  credit  with a limit of
$3,000,000,  secured by accounts receivable,  inventory, fixed asset blanket and
general  intangibles,  and bears interest at the bank's prime rate plus 4 3/4 %.
As of December 31, 2003,  $2,090,448  had been drawn under the credit line.  The
line of credit  will  fluctuate  based upon  production  needs and the timing of
collection of receivable  balances.  Additionally,  the Company's borrowing base
fluctuates as receivables and inventory  change.  The borrowing base is equal to
(1) the  lesser of the  maximum  line  amount or (2) the sum of 70% of  eligible
accounts  receivable plus the lesser of 40% of eligible inventory or $2 million.
The line of credit is subject to certain net worth and earnings  covenants,  and
an annual capital  expenditure limit. The Company was not in compliance with the
net worth and earnings  covenants at December 31, 2003 and has received a waiver
for these  violations.  The  Company's  covenants  have  been  reset for 2004 to
provide  the  Company  with the  ability to  operate  under its  financial  plan
submitted to its primary lender.  Management  believes that funds generated from
operations,  management's  implemented  expense reduction plan and other changes
being considered to the Company's business model (as discussed above and in Note
2 to the Company's  Financial  Statements),  and the Company's operating line of
credit, will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements through 2004.
The Company's line of credit is subject to renewal in May 2006.

      On December 18, 2000, the Company  entered into an agreement with Dresdner
Bank to guarantee up to 511,292 Euro ($535,987 US) as security for an additional
cash credit facility of the Company's German joint venture.  In August 2003, the
guarantee was reduced by Dresdner Bank to 250,000 Euro  ($312,500 US). There

                                       27
<PAGE>
was -0- Euro  outstanding  and  guaranteed by the Company under this  additional
cash credit facility at December 31, 2003.

      Accounts payable increased 3.72% at December 31, 2003 to $936,953 compared
to $903,309 at December  31,  2002.  The increase for the year was the result of
the Company  continuing  its  manufacturing  process  during the fourth  quarter
(resulting  from the Company's  pre-season  order program whereby the Company is
trying to level out its  production  process),  coupled with some  extended term
payment arrangements provided by some of the Company's principal suppliers. (See
"trade credit" discussion above.)

      Accrued  expenses and other current  liabilities in total decreased 15.31%
at December 31, 2003 to $961,731  compared to  $1,135,608  at December 31, 2002.
The decrease in total  accrued  expenses and other current  liabilities  for the
year was the  result of  decreased  payroll & benefit  accruals  from  personnel
reductions  during the year,  coupled with  decreased  dealer  deposits from the
Company's  change in its customer  payment options  implemented in late 2002, in
addition to lower accrued warranty  expenses  resulting from the Company passing
on more warranty costs to its principal suppliers.  This was offset by increases
in volume discounts from the Company's  pre-season  order program,  coupled with
increased general and pre-season order flooring interest accruals.

      In 1997, the Nasdaq listing requirements were substantially  expanded. The
Company does not currently qualify under the more stringent requirements because
the  price at which  its  Common  Stock is  trading  is below  the $1 per  share
minimum.  The Company was formally notified on January 13, 1999, that its Common
Stock was delisted from quotation on The Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market for failure to
meet the new listing  requirements.  The Company's Common Stock is now quoted on
the OTC Bulletin Board. The removal from quotation on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market
could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on the  Company's  ability  to  raise
additional  equity  capital  in a  public  stock  offering  should  that  become
necessary.

      The following table outlines the Company's future contractual  obligations

FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
--------------------------------------------

You should carefully  consider the following factors  regarding  forward-looking
statements and other information  included in this Annual Report.  The risks and
uncertainties  described below are not the only ones we face.  Additional  risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
also may impair our business operations.  If any of the following risks actually
occur,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  operating  results  could  be
materially adversely affected.

o    We are dependent on the Dairy Industry

         More than 75% of our revenues come from the dairy industry.

o    A downturn in the dairy industry could cause a reduction in our revenues.

         Our sales are highly  correlated  with the price of milk  products  and
         revenues of the dairy industry. When dairy farmers make money, they buy
         our  products.  When  dairy  farmers  are not making  money,  our sales
         decline.

o    A sharp  decline in the  health and  government  subsidies  of the  farming
     sector of the U.S. economy could cause a reduction in our revenue.

         If a reduction in availability of credit or government subsidies in the
         farming sector occurs,  or, interest rates begin to rise, our sales may
         decline as farmers  will find it more  difficult  to  purchase  capital
         equipment  and may become more  cautious on incurring  additional  farm
         debt.

o    Our revenues are historically seasonal and dependent on weather conditions.

         Our core business is dependent on weather conditions during the harvest
         seasons in North America and Europe.  Adverse weather conditions affect
         farmers'  crops  and  reduce  demand  for our  products.  Approximately
         53%-70% of our  revenue  is  historically  generated  in the second and
         third  quarters.  In September 2002 however,  the Company took steps to
         begin to counteract some of this  seasonality  with the introduction of
         its pre-season  order program which it continued for the 2003-04 season
         with some modifications.

o    We may not  continue  to gain market  acceptance  of our  pre-season  order
     program.

         The Company  introduced  a new  pre-season  order  program in September
         2002,  which was  modified in October  2003,  for use by the  Company's
         dealers in placing their entire  anticipated next year's product order.
         This is the first time the Company has introduced  such a comprehensive
         program and no assurance can be given that it will be fully accepted in
         the marketplace.

o    We may lose our third-party financing sources.

         The Company is dependent upon its  relationships  with its  independent
         third-party  financing sources and dealers' local banks,  which provide
         both  wholesale and retail  financing to the Company's  dealers and end
         users. If the Company's  independent  third-party financing sources, or
         dealers'  local banks,  were unable to offer their current  programs or
         provide  the  level of  credit to the  Company's  dealers,  alternative
         sources would have to be found. This may cause a delay in the Company's
         ability  to ship  product  under  the  terms  of its  pre-season  order
         program.

                                       29
<PAGE>
o    Our intellectual property protection may not be adequate.

         We have patents on our basic bagging  machines and patents  pending for
         additional machines, bags and systems for silage bagging, grain bagging
         and  hay/straw  bale  bagging.  We may not obtain these patents and our
         patents may not withstand litigation challenges.  If our patents do not
         withstand  litigation  challenges,   our  rights  in  bag  and  machine
         technology could be diminished or eliminated. Moreover, the issuance of
         patents  covering any of our products  may be  insufficient  to prevent
         competitors  from  duplicating  our products.  The patent laws of other
         countries  may differ from those of the United  States as to the patent
         ability of our products  and  processes,  and the degree of  protection
         afforded by foreign  patents may be  different  from that in the United
         States.

o    We rely on one principal supplier for our bags.

         We purchase  nearly all of our bags from one supplier under a long-term
         requirements  contract.  Any  disruption of the  manufacturing  process
         could  affect  that  company's  ability to supply our needs,  and could
         adversely affect our sales.

o    Our bag pricing is dependent on the price of resin.

         The prices that we pay for bags, which account for  approximately  half
         of our  annual  sales,  are  fixed  annually  in  advance  and are tied
         directly to the price of resin.  Resin  prices have  historically  been
         subject to significant price volatility. Increases in the price of bags
         could  adversely  affect  our  profit  margins if we are unable to pass
         along the price  increase,  and would  likely  affect our  revenues  if
         alternatives to our product become more attractive because of the price
         increases.

o    Our  stock is quoted on the OTC  Bulletin  Board,  which may make the stock
     more difficult to sell.

         We no longer satisfy the criteria for continued quotation on The Nasdaq
         SmallCap  Market.  Our stock is,  instead,  quoted on the OTC  Bulletin
         Board.  As a result,  our  shareholders  may find it more  difficult to
         dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of,
         our  common  stock,  and the  market  price  for our  common  stock may
         decline.  Trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of
         Rule 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under
         this  rule,  broker/dealers  who  recommend  low-priced  securities  to
         persons other than established  customers and accredited investors must
         satisfy  special sales practice  requirements,  including a requirement
         that they make an individualized written suitability  determination for
         the purchaser and receive the purchaser's  written consent prior to the
         transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform
         Act of 1990 also requires additional  disclosure in connection with any
         trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock (generally any equity
         security  not  traded on an  exchange  or  quoted on Nasdaq  that has a
         market  price  of  less  than  $5.00  per  share,  subject  to  certain
         exceptions),   including  the  delivery,   prior  to  any  penny  stock
         transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market
         and  the  risks   associated   with  the  penny  stock  market.   These
         requirements  could severely  limit the market  liquidity of our common
         stock and the ability of our  shareholders  to dispose of their shares,
         particularly in a declining market.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
--------------------------------------------------------------------

         Market risk is the exposure to loss  resulting from changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates,  commodity prices and equity prices. The
primary market risk to which the Company is exposed is interest rates.

         The  Company's  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates is  minimal.
Primarily all of the Company's  long-term debt is fixed rate. The Company's line
of credit is based on the prime rate plus 4 3/4%.


ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
----------------------------------------------------

      Reference  is made to the  financial  statements  and  related  notes  and
supplemental data under Item 15 filed with this report.


ITEM  9.  CHANGES  IN AND  DISAGREEMENTS  WITH  ACCOUNTANTS  ON  ACCOUNTING  AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      None.


ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
---------------------------------

     As of December 31, 2003, the Company  carried out an evaluation,  under the
supervision and with the  participation of the Company's  management,  including
the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial Officer,
of the  effectiveness  of the design and operation of the  Company's  disclosure
controls and procedures.  Based on the evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information  required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,  summarized and reported within the
time periods  specified in Securities and Exchange  Commission  rules and forms.
There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls or in other
factors that could significantly  affect these controls including any corrective
actions  with  regard  to  significant   deficiencies  and  material  weaknesses
subsequent to the date the Company completed its evaluation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Ag-Bag International Limited


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Ag-Bag International  Limited
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,  and the related  statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders'  equity, and cash flows for each of
the years in the  three-year  period ended  December 31, 2003.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  These  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Ag-Bag International Limited as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002,  and the results of its  operations  and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
Company  will  continue  as a  going  concern.  As  discussed  in  Note 2 to the
financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations,
has a  retained  deficit,  negative  cash flows  from  operations  and is out of
compliance  with its bank  covenants,  which raise  substantial  doubt about its
ability to continue  as a going  concern.  Management's  plans  regarding  those
matters also are  described in Note 2. The  financial  statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Company  considers all  highly-liquid  investments  with original  maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

The Company  transferred  $135,490 in 2003 from rental  equipment  to  inventory
held-for-sale.  In  2003,  2002,  and  2001 the  Company  transferred  $183,911,
$331,726,  and $697,849,  respectively,  from inventory  held-for-sale to rental
equipment.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - Accounts receivable are from distributors and customers of
the Company's products.  The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its
customers and maintains  allowances for potential credit losses. Also, to reduce
the risk of credit  loss,  the Company  requires  letters of credit from foreign
customers with which no credit history has been established.

Receivables are presented at the aggregate unpaid principle balance amounts, net
of an allowance for doubtful  accounts.  The allowance for doubtful  accounts is
established  through a provision for bad debts expense.  Receivables are charged
against the allowance for bad debt when management  believes the  collectibility
of an account is unlikely.  The allowance is an amount that management  believes
will be adequate to absorb future losses on existing receivables that may become
uncollectible based upon overall receivable quality,  review of specific problem
accounts,  current economic  conditions,  and prior charge-off  experience.  The
uncollectible  portion of a customer's  unpaid principle  balance is charged-off
after  the  Company   initiates  the  collection   process,   investigates   the
circumstances  of  the  past-due  balance,   and  determines  an  amount  to  be
uncollectible.   Generally,   the  Company  considers  receivables  from  import
shipments  past due after 15 days;  export and air  freight  shipments  past due
after 30 days;  and shipments  utilizing a foreign agent past due after 60 days.
The Company  accrues  interest  on past-due  accounts  and  continues  to accrue
interest until the Company considers the receivable uncollectible.

INVENTORIES  -  Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower of cost or  market  (net
realizable value). The Company determines cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
basis. The Company's estimates of market value incorporate projections of future
sales  volume  by  product  class.  In  estimating  the  market  value  of parts
inventory,  the Company  reviews current  inventory  levels in relation to sales
forecasts  and adjusts the  valuation  reserve  accordingly.  For the  remaining
categories of inventory,  the Company establishes a reserve balance based on the
aging of the specific inventory items.

                                                                             F-7

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
           POLICIES - (continued)

PROPERTY,  PLANT,  AND EQUIPMENT - Property,  plant, and equipment are stated at
cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives  which  range  from 5 to 7 years  for  equipment,  and 20 to 30 years  for
buildings.

Expenditures for additions and major improvements are capitalized.  Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS - Intangible assets consist of licenses and patents.  The cost
of the  licenses and patents are  amortized  over the lesser of the terms of the
related agreement or the estimated useful lives of the respective asset, ranging
from 7 to 12 years.

THIRD-PARTY  FINANCING  ARRANGEMENTS  - The  Company  assigns  some of its trade
accounts receivable to various third-party financing sources with discount rates
ranging  from .75% to 1.5% at December  31,  2003.  The accounts can be assigned
with or without recourse  depending on the specific  account being assigned.  At
December  31,  2003,  the  balance  of  assigned   accounts  with  recourse  was
$3,155,990.  Management  has reviewed the accounts with recourse at December 31,
2003, and determined that no accrual is necessary for potential  future recourse
obligations.

PRE-SEASON  ORDER FLOORING - During 2002,  the Company  implemented a Pre-Season
Order Program under which the Company pays the flooring interest for dealers who
make  purchases  from the Company under  specific  provisions of the  Pre-Season
Order Program. The Company estimates their future obligations under this program
at the time of sale,  reduces  sales  revenues,  and accrues a liability for the
estimated  future  interest  obligation.  Total  dealer  flooring  interest  was
$344,870  and  $113,534  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2003  and  2002,
respectively.

VOLUME  DISCOUNTS - Under the same  Pre-Season  Order Program,  the Company pays
volume  discounts to dealers based upon a sliding scale for the volume of orders
placed by dealers.  The Company  estimates their future  obligations  under this
program at the time of sale, reduces sales revenues, and accrues a liability for
the estimated  future volume discount  obligation.  Total volume  discounts were
$732,458, $182,765 and $71,635 for years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

REVENUE  RECOGNITION  - Revenue is  recognized  when the  customer has placed an
order for the product, the product is delivered or shipped to the customer,  the
sale's price has been  determined,  and  collection is reasonably  assured.  The
Company  includes  revenues earned on shipping costs billed to customers in "Net
Sales," and costs to ship products are included in "Cost of Sales."

ADVERTISING COSTS - The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.
Advertising  expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 were
$412,047, $504,060, and $573,945, respectively.

WARRANTY  RESERVE - At the time of sale, the Company accrues a liability for the
estimated  future  costs to be incurred  under the  provisions  of its  warranty
agreements.  The Company  reviews its  historical  warranty  expense and current
sales'  trends in products  covered  under  warranty,  and adjusts its  warranty

STOCK  OPTION  PLAN - The  Company  applies  Accounting  Principles  Board (APB)
Opinion  No.  25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued  to  Employees,"  and  related
interpretations   in  accounting   for  its  stock  option  plan.   Accordingly,
compensation  expense  related to grants to  employees  would be recorded on the
date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying  stock exceeded
the exercise price.  Had  compensation  cost for the Company's stock option plan
been  determined  based upon the fair  value at grant date for awards  under the
plan consistent with the methodology  prescribed under the Financial  Accounting
Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation," additional compensation expense
would have been recognized.

The Company has computed,  for pro forma disclosure  purposes,  the value of all
options  granted  during 2003,  2002, and 2001 using the  Black-Scholes  pricing
model as prescribed under SFAS No. 123. The following  assumptions were made for
grants in 2003,  2002, and 2001:  risk-free  interest rate of 2.94%,  4.41%, and
4.41%, respectively, expected life of seven years, and dividend rates of 0%. For
2003,  2002,  and 2001 the expected  volatility  over the expected  lives of the
grants  was  assumed  to be  102.52%,  77.04%,  and  77.92%,  respectively.  The
weighted-average  fair value of the options  granted was estimated to be $.34 in
2003, $.20 in 2002, and $.34 in 2001.










                                                                             F-9

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
           POLICIES - (continued)

If the Company had accounted for the value of the options  granted  during 2003,
2002,  and 2001, in  accordance  with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net loss would
have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below:


                                 2003                2002             2001
                             ----------------   --------------   ---------------

    Net loss:
        As reported             $ (2,753,715)       $(663,988)        $(164,150)
        Pro forma               $ (2,766,083)       $(673,278)        $(178,023)

    Net loss per share:
        As reported                  $ (0.24)         $ (0.06)          $ (0.02)
        Pro forma                    $ (0.24)         $ (0.06)          $ (0.02)


The resulting pro forma  compensation  costs may not be  representative  of that
expected in future years.

INCOME  TAXES - The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  under  the asset and
liability  method.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized for the
future tax  consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial
statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their
respective  tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are measured using
enacted  tax rates  expected  to apply to  taxable  income in the years in which
those temporary  differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Valuation
allowances are  established to reduce  potential  deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that all or some portion of  potential  deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $1,577,772 and $1,013,000 as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Management has established a valuation
allowance of $1,577,772 against these deferred tax assets.

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE - Basic net income per share is calculated using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Preferred
stock dividends were considered in the  computation.  The calculation of diluted
net income per share  excludes the effect of potentially  dilutive  common stock
equivalents  because  their impact,  when  calculated  using the treasury  stock
method, is antidilutive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
           POLICIES - (continued)

SEGMENT INFORMATION -the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related  Information,"  which  establishes  annual and interim
reporting   standards  for  an  enterprise's   operating  segments  and  related
disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas, and major customers.
The Company has  analyzed  the  reporting  requirements  of the standard and has
determined that its operations are within a single operating segment.

DISCLOSURE  OF FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  - The  carrying  amounts of
financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable,
and accounts payable  approximated  fair value as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
because of the  relatively  short  maturity of these  instruments.  The carrying
value of notes payable approximated fair value as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
based upon interest rates and terms available for the same or similar loans.

MANAGEMENT  ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial  statements,  in conformity
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Significant  estimates used in preparing these financial  statements
include  allowances for doubtful  accounts  receivable,  inventory  obsolescence
reserves,  depreciation  methods for property,  plant and  equipment,  valuation
allowances  for  deferred  tax assets and  reserves  for  recourse  obligations,
warranty obligations, and Pre-Season Order flooring interest obligations.

RECENTLY  ISSUED  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS - In June 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
150, "Accounting for Certain Financial  Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities  and  Equity."  This  statement   establishes   standards  regarding
classification   and   measurement  of  certain   financial   instruments   with
characteristics   of  both  liabilities  and  equity.   It  requires   financial
instruments  within the scope of this  statement to be classified as liabilities
(or assets in some  circumstances).  Many of these  financial  instruments  were
previously  classified  as equity.  This  statement is effective  for  financial
instruments  entered  into or modified  after May 31,  2003,  and was  otherwise
effective at the beginning of the first interim period  beginning after June 15,
2003.  For  financial  instruments  created  before  the  issuance  date of this
statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption,
transition  is achieved by  reporting  the  cumulative  effect of a change in an
accounting  principle by initially  measuring the financial  instruments at fair
value. Management does not expect that the application of the provisions of this
statement will have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.








                                                                            F-11

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
           POLICIES - (continued)

In April 2003,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,  "Amendment  of  Statement  133 on
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  This  statement  amends and
clarifies  financial  accounting  and  reporting  for  derivative   instruments,
including  certain  derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts and for
hedging  activities under SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging Activities."  Management does not expect that the application of the
provisions  of this  statement  will have a  material  impact  on the  Company's
financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),  "Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,  "Consolidated  Financial  Statements," and
requires existing  unconsolidated  variable interest entities to be consolidated
by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks
among parties involved.  This  interpretation  explains how to identify variable
interest  entities and how an  enterprise  assesses its  interests in a variable
interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity.  In December 2003,
FASB made revisions and delayed  implementation of certain provisions of FIN 46.
As a public  entity that is not a "Small  Business  Issuer,"  the Company is now
required  to apply FIN 46 to all  unconsolidated  variable-interest  entities no
later than March 31, 2004, with the exception of unconsolidated  special-purpose
entities,   which  had  an   implementation   deadline  of  December  31,  2003.
Special-purpose  entities for this  provision  are expected to include  entities
whose  activities  are primarily  related to  securitizations  or other forms of
asset-backed  financings or single-lessee leasing  arrangements.  The Company is
associated with a potential variable-interest entity through their investment in
BAW  as   described   in  Note  12.   Management   determined   that  BAW  is  a
variable-interest  entity but  concluded  that the  Company  is not the  primary
beneficiary.  Management  does not expect that the application of the provisions
of this  interpretation  will have a material impact on the Company's  financial
statements.

RECLASSIFICATIONS  -  Certain  reclassifications  have  been  made  to the  2002
financial statements to conform with the 2003 presentation.

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN

As shown in the  accompanying  financial  statements,  the Company  incurred net
losses of $2,753,715, $663,988, and $164,150 during the previous three years and
has an accumulated  deficit of $3,696,569 at December 31, 2003. The Company also
had negative cash flows from  operations of $1,341,605  for the current  period.
The Company is out of compliance with its net worth and earnings covenants under
their line of credit  agreement  with its primary  lender,  Wells Fargo Business
Credit.

Management  believes their recent weak operating results have been primarily due
to depressed milk prices in the agricultural  sector,  which has a direct impact
on the disposable income of their dairy farmer customers.  Management  estimates
that over 75% of their end users are dairy  farmers.  Management  believes  that
dairy  farmers have been delaying or  eliminating  capital  expenditures  due to
their   uncertainties   regarding  milk  prices  and  their  disposable  income.
Management  further  believes that early  predictions  for 2004 show milk prices
significantly  higher  than the  historically  low  levels  seen for much of the
previous years and expects  operating  results to improve as dairy farmers begin
to see increases in their  disposable  income through  stabilizing  milk prices.
Management  also  feels  that  its  dealers  have  been  conservative  on  their
pre-season orders for 2003-04 as a result of the prolonged, depressed milk price
situation. It is managements feeling that some of its dealers will have the need
to re-order  additional  product  during the year as a result of the  forecasted
improving  milk  price,  which  should  help  them  sell out of their  remaining
inventories  currently  in  their  dealer  stock.  If this  happens,  there is a
potential  for higher  gross  margins for the  Company,  as the dealer  would be
re-ordering  outside of the  pre-season  order program terms which provide for a
lower  volume  discount  on  their  re-orders.   In  addition,   management  has
implemented an expense reduction plan. Specifically,  management has implemented
staff reductions and reduced salaries of senior management. Nonessential capital
expenditures,   travel  and  other  expenses  have  either  been  eliminated  or
postponed.  Management has also been considering other changes to their business
model such as  opportunities  to sell the  business,  refinance  its  Warrenton,
Oregon facility (which has only a small economic  development  loan  outstanding
against this collateral), consolidate or dispose of manufacturing facilities, or
other  tangible  or  intangible  assets,  including  selling the  Company's  50%
interest  in its  joint  venture,  or take out a policy  loan  against  the life
insurance  policies  currently in force in which the Company is the beneficiary,
to provide positive cash flows to the Company.

Because it is unclear  whether the Company will be successful  in  accomplishing
these  objectives,  there is uncertainty about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.








                                                                            F-13

reserved 133,575 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan. Under terms
of the Plan,  stock is awarded to employees at the sole  discretion of the Board

NOTE 12 - BAW JOINT VENTURE

On February 27, 1997, the Company entered into a Joint Venture  Agreement (Joint
Venture)   with   Budissa   Agroservice    Gesellschaft   and   formed   Budissa
Agrodienstleistungen  und Warenhandels  (BAW). The Company has a 50% interest in
BAW which is accounted for under the equity  method.  BAW folds and  distributes
silage  bags  throughout  Europe.  The  Company's  accumulated  deficit has been
reduced by undistributed equity earnings from BAW of $441,229 as of December 31,
2003.

On February  27,  1997,  BAW also  entered  into a lease  agreement  with Ag-Bag
International Limited for the use of a folding machine.  Royalties are earned by
the Company  based upon the  poundage  folded by BAW. In 2003,  2002,  and 2001,
income from this agreement was $200,000, $190,000 and $168,000, respectively. On
June 30, 2003,  the Company sold the  depreciated  folding  machine to the Joint
Venture for $400,000,  which terminated this folding lease  agreement.  The sale
resulted in a gain of $345,836,  of which  $172,918 was  deferred.  The deferred
gain is being  recognized  over the estimated  useful life of the asset on BAW's
books. At December 31, 2003, the remaining deferred gain is $86,464.

On December 18, 2000,  Ag-Bag  International  Limited  entered into an agreement
with  Dresdner Bank to guarantee up to 511,292 Euro  ($535,987  USD) as security
for an additional  cash credit facility of BAW. On August 5, 2003, the guarantee
was reduced by Dresdner Bank to 250,000 Euro ($312,500  USD).  There was no Euro
outstanding  under this additional cash credit facility at December 31, 2003 and
2002,  respectively.  Upon modification of the agreement during 2003, management
estimated  the fair  value of the  guarantee  to be  $15,000.  The  Company  has
recorded an accrued a liability of $15,000 at December 31, 2003.

                           INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
                         -------------------------------


We have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of BAW group as of December 31,
2003,  2002 and 2001 and the related  statements  of operating  results and cash
flows, for the years then ended,  which, as described in Note 1 to the financial
statements  have been prepared on the basis of accounting  principles  generally
accepted in Germany.  These financial  statements are the  responsibility of the
company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial  statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
with auditing  standards  generally accepted in the United States of America and
in Germany. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of BAW group as of December 31,
2003,  2002 and 2001,  and the results of its  operations and its cash flows for
the years ended December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in Germany.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

a) Voluntary group accounts

Pursuant  to the  resolution  adopted by the  shareholders  January 29, 2003 the
corporation  prepared the group  accounts  voluntarily as per December 31, 2003.
The limits of ss. 293 HGB are not exceeded.  The group accounts were prepared on
the basis of the  provisions of the  commercial  law.  These are group  accounts
according to the commercial law only. Tax options were not used.

b) Cut-off Date and deferred valuation of the consolidated companies

BAW Budissa Agrodienstleistungen und Warenhandels GmbH as the parent company and
the subsidiaries AG-BAG HUNGARIA KFT and "AG BAG Polska" Sp.zo.o.  were included
in the group  accounts.  The group accounts date is December 31, 2003.  Both the
parent company and the included  subsidiaries  prepared proper annual  financial
statements as of this cut-off date.

c) Breakdown of the group accounts and valuation principles

The  group  accounts  and the  group  profit  and loss  account  are  shown  and
classified   pursuant  to  the   provisions  of  the  commercial  law  regarding
corporations. The requirements of ss.ss. 297 ff HGB were complied with.

Since the corporation is a joint venture,  uniform valuation  regulations had to
be agreed for the group accounts.

Since the  parent  company  has its  registered  office  and its  management  in
Germany,  they agreed to use German valuation  regulations for the present group
accounts without considering tax privileges  according to the German,  Polish or
Hungarian tax laws.




























                                      F-39
<PAGE>
The balancing and valuation  options were executed  pursuant to ss. 300 sub-p. 2
HGB such that they meet the accounting standards of the USA (US GAAP).

As a result,  pursuant to ss. 300 sub-p. 2 HGB a commercial balance sheet II had
to be drawn up for the individual  financial  statements to be included (see Tz.
26 to ss. 300 HGB in Beck'scher Bilanzkommentar, 4. edition). In this commercial
balance sheet II tax privileges were eliminated and uniform valuation principles
were used. The currencies of the foreign  individual  financial  statements were
converted according to the concept of the functional currency.
Pursuant to this  concept the balance  sheet had to be converted at the exchange
rate date - except the equity which was valued at the historical  rate - and the
profit and loss account at the average rate.

                          Poland                  Hungary

Current rate        1 PLZ = 0.21228 EUR   1 HUF = 0.003831 EUR
Average rate        1 PLZ = 0.23034 EUR   1 HUF = 0.004035 EUR

Fixed  assets were  valued on the basis of the  initial  costs less a linear pro
rata temporis or degressive depreciation, respectively.

Stocks and  inventories are valued at group  manufacturing  costs or cost prices
considering the lowest value principle.

Accounts  receivable  and other assets are valued at their  nominal  value minus
potential  allowances for losses on individual bank loan accounts or retirements
of accounts receivable.

Transitory items were shown pursuant to ss. 250 HGB.

The special  item  including  reserves  (allowances)  was shown  pursuant to the
recommendations   of  the   HFA-Stellungnahme   1/1984  of  the   Institut   der
Wirtschaftsprufer in Deutschland e.V.

Reserves take into account all risks apparent at the time.  Accounts payable are
shown at their repayment value.

d) Consolidation of Funds

For the capital consolidation the book-value method (ss. 301 sub-p. 1 no. 1 HGB)
was applied,  that is the valuation of the shares in the  subsidiaries  were set
off against the equity of the  subsidiaries,  allocated  to these  shares,  that
corresponds  to the book  value of the assets  and debts to be  included  in the
group accounts.  The difference amounting to EUR 4,072.28 was not capitalized as
goodwill - different  from what is  required  by ss. 301 sub-p.  3 HGB - but was
deducted from the group capital (profit carry  forward),  since it includes only
the costs for incorporation.  The shares of other shareholders shown pursuant to
ss. 307 HGB were taken into account.

e) Consolidation of Debts

According to the standard  theory the mutual  accounts  receivable  and accounts
payable existing  between the companies  included in the group accounts were set
off pursuant to ss. 303 sub-p.  1 HGB.  The total amount of the mutual  accounts
receivable and accounts  payable that were set off amounts to 164.6 ThEUR.  11.0
ThEUR was shown as money being transferred (from Hungary to Germany).

f) Interim result elimination

In the financial year 2003,  like in the previous  years,  interim  results were
eliminated,  see ss. 304 sub-p.  1 HGB. A total of EUR  21,913.25 was debited as
expenditure.  This was  necessary for the  readjustment  of the valuation of the
finished products and goods to group-uniform manufacturing costs.

g) Expenditure and Income Consolidation

The  expenditure  and earnings from the mutual  supply and service  transactions
were set off against one another amounting to 736.5 ThEUR.

h) Deferred taxation

Deferred taxation was made according to ss. 274 HGB and ss. 306 HGB as follows:

     a)  In the commercial balance sheet II of BAW Budissa  Agrodienstleistungen
         und Warenhandels GmbH the tax option was eliminated pursuant to ss. 7 g
         EStG (ss. 300 sub-p. 2 HGB).

     b)  The item of deferred taxes in the group accounts was currently adjusted
         in the year under review starting from 01.01.2003.

     c)  National differences in the tax rates were kept.

RECONCILIATION OF GERMAN GAAP TO U.S. GAAP
------------------------------------------

The primary  difference  between the generally  accepted  accounting  principles
(GAAP) of  Germany  and the United  States is that  German  GAAP  allows for the
special reserve for a company's economic  development  plans. This reserve,  and
related tax impact,  would not be recognized under U.S. GAAP. The following is a
reconciliation  of affected  balance sheet and profits and loss accounts for the
differences between German GAAP and U.S. GAAP:
