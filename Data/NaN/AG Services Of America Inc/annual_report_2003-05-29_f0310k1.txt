PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Financial Information about Industry Segments

The Company is engaged in one industry segment - the supplying of a wide
range of farm inputs at competitive prices along with the credit to
finance these farm inputs through the crop growing cycle.

Narrative Description of Business

General:

Ag Services of America, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the
laws of the state of Iowa in 1985.  The Company's primary business is the
supply of farm inputs, including seed, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals,
crop insurance and cash advances for rent, fuel and irrigation, to farmers
through out the United States.  The Company buys seed, fertilizer,
agricultural chemicals and other farm inputs from numerous national and
regional manufacturers, distributors and suppliers of seed, fertilizer
and agricultural chemicals.  Farmers have traditionally purchased farm
inputs from one or more suppliers using credit from commercial banks,
the Farm Credit System, the FmHA or other agricultural lenders.  The
Company extends credit and provides farmers the convenience of purchasing
and financing a wide varitey of farm inputs from a single source at
competitive prices.  The Company's strategy has been to provide a
single source of farm inputs and the credit necessary to finance these
inputs through the growing cycle by taking a security interest in the
crop itself.  This strategy is an attractive alternative to farmers
who have difficulty obtaining credit, who needed additional credit for
the expansion of existing operations and/or who wanted the convenience
of a single source of farm inputs, finance and product expertise.

The Company believes that its business strategy has been responsible for
its growth and has focused its efforts on the following principles:

*  Supplying and financing a complete line of quality farm inputs from one
   or more of numerous suppliers at competitive prices with prompt delivery.
*  Providing customers with appropriate product selection and crop
   production advice from the Company's product specialists.
*  Providing detailed monthly statements to simplify the customer's
   bookkeeping for all farm inputs purchased from the Company throughout
   each growing season.
*  Offering multi-peril crop insurance through the Company as a licensed
   insurance agency.
*  Visiting customers' farms to view crops and discuss harvest plans and
   marketing strategies.
*  Providing professional and personalized service throughout the entire
   growing season to encourage renewed business each year.
*  Selecting credit worthy and experienced customers.

                                   -3-

Principal Markets:

The Company's customers are currently located in 38 states.   The Company's
principal target market is corn and soybean producers in the states of Iowa,
Minnesota, Nebraska, Illinois, Ohio, South Dakota, North Dakota, Texas and
Indiana.

Products and Suppliers:

The Company buys seed, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and other farm inputs
from numerous manufacturers, distributors or dealers.  These suppliers may
deliver the farm inputs directly to the Company's customers.   The Company
negotiates the purchase price, discounts and trade credit annually with most
of these suppliers.   During the year ended February 28, 2003 ("Fiscal 2003"),
the percentage of net revenues attributed to the sale of seed, agricultural
chemicals, fertilizer, financing income, customer fees and other income was
26.1%, 29.2%, 25.8%, 14.8%, 3.3% and 0.8%, respectively.

Seed. The Company currently buys seed from approximately 30 national and
regional seed companies.  Seed company representatives as well as the
Company's account managers work directly with the Company's customers to
assist them in selecting specific hybrids and varieties of seed.  The
Company sells seed at competitive prices and achieves its margin based
on standard industry discounts or negotiated volume discounts, if available.
Seed is delivered to the Company's customers directly by the seed
companies.

Agricultural Chemicals. The Company currently buys agricultural chemicals
from major distributors or suppliers.  The Company sells agricultural
chemicals at competitive prices and achieves its margin based on dealer
discounts, negotiated pricing, manufacturers' rebates and opportunistic
purchasing.  Agricultural chemicals are generally delivered directly to
the customer's farm by the distributor or through a dealer.

Fertilizer. The Company currently buys fertilizer from over 500 suppliers.
The Company sells fertilizer at competitive prices and achieves its
margin based on dealer discounts, negotiated pricing or opportunistic
purchasing.   The Company purchases fertilizer using two alternative
methods, depending on the customer's needs.  For those customers with
storage facilities to handle bulk dry materials, bulk fluids or anhydrous
ammonia, the Company may purchase the materials through major fertilizer
distribution terminals or manufacturers.  These bulk materials may be
direct-shipped in truckload quantities to the customer's farm.  Customers
without storage facilities can have the materials supplied by the Company,
which may enlist the delivery service of a local fertilizer dealer.

Customer Fees. Customer fees are primarily comprised of program fees charged
to customers and insurance commissions.  Program fees are fees charged to
customer's accounts upon approval, net of estimated refunds.  The Company
offers its customers multi-peril crop insurance as an agent, although
customers may also purchase multi-peril crop insurance from other insurance
agents.  Through twenty-one of its employees, the Company is currently
licensed as an insurance agent in approximately 30 states.  When customers
purchase the insurance through the Company's agent, the Company receives
a commission based on the premium amount.

Cash Rents, Fuel, Irrigation and Custom Application. The Company also
provides its customers with credit for cash rents, fuel, irrigation and
custom application costs.  The amount of credit extended to customers for
these input costs is not reported as net revenue, but is an integral part

                                -4-
<PAGE>

of the complete financing package for the customer's crop input needs.
If a customer's farm acreage is leased, the landowner may require payment
of the annual rent before planting.  Based on its credit policy and the
customer's needs, the Company may assist its customers with the advance
payment of all or a portion of these cash rents.  The Company's customers
generally arrange their own fuel, irrigation and custom application needs
and the Company may, based on its credit policy, advance cash for a portion
or all of these costs.

Government Programs:

The two principal government programs affecting the Company's business
are government underwritten multi-peril crop insurance and the government's
farm subsidy program payments.

Multi-Peril Crop Insurance. The Company requires that its customers purchase
multi-peril crop insurance and assign the insurance coverage to the Company
as collateral for the credit extended by the Company to the customer.
Multi-peril crop insurance, while sold and administered in large part by
private companies, is currently underwritten by the Federal Crop Insurance
Corporation ("FCIC"), an agency of the United States Government.  Current
multi-peril crop insurance generally covers crop losses for hail, wind,
drought, flood and certain other covered events.

While various forms of federal multi-peril crop insurance have been in
existence since 1938, federal farm policies and funding are subject to
periodic change, and there can be no assurance that the FCIC or any other
federal agency will continue to underwrite multi-peril crop insurance
on an ongoing basis.  If the Company's customers were not able to obtain
multi-peril crop insurance through some combination of the FCIC or
domestic or foreign private insurance underwriters at a reasonable cost,
the Company would be required to seek alternative collateral from its
customers, which could have a material adverse affect on the Company's
net revenues.  There can be no assurance that multi-peril crop insurance
will continue to be available to the Company's customers or, if available,
for a reasonable cost.

FSA "Farm Program" Payments. The United States Department of Agriculture,
through its Farm Service Agency ("FSA"), guarantees participating farmers
various forms of payments on "base acres" for various crops over the next
year under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002
("2002 Farm Bill").  Corn, soybeans, wheat and certain other crops are
currently eligible under the FSA farm program.  If a customer of the
Company participates in the FSA farm program, the Company may supplement
its security by obtaining an assignment of the customer's FSA "Farm Program"
payments.  While various forms of federal support programs have been in
existence since 1933, federal farm policies and funding, including support
payments under the 2002 Farm Bill, are subject to periodic change, and
there can be no assurance that the FSA or any other federal agency will
continue to provide support programs on an ongoing basis.  Prior to the
signing of the 2002 Farm Bill, the Federal Agriculture and Improvement
Act of 1995 was in effect.

Farm Input Pricing and Finance Charges:

The Company structures its pricing of farm inputs so that the net prices
paid by its customers who take advantage of the Company's payment discounts
are generally competitive with farm inputs purchased from other distributors
or suppliers.  The Company charges its customers for farm inputs when provided.

                                  -5-
<PAGE>

Finance charges on credit extended to a customer commence immediately for
cash rents provided by the Company and on the date shipped for other farm
input products sold by the Company to a customer.  The Company establishes
and sets its interest rates each year based on the Company's estimate of
market conditions and anticipated interest costs over the year.  For the
year ending February 28, 2004 ("Fiscal 2004"), the Company's customers
will be charged interest at a variable rate note at prime to 4.0% above
prime based on the credit worthiness of the customer.  The variable rate
notes with customers may be subject to an "interest rate floor" which
locks in a minimum interest rate for customers ranging from 4.75% to 10.25%.
As of April 9, 2003, the current prime rate is 4.25% per annum as
published in the Midwest Edition of The Wall Street Journal.

Currently customer accounts, including all interest, are due by January 15th
for North accounts and January 31st for South accounts.  The Company
currently assesses a 3.0% program fee based on the customer's established
credit limit and the customer can earn back all or part of the program fee
based on the following repayment dates for North accounts: 3.0% for customer
accounts paid off by December 1, 2.0% for customer accounts paid off by
December 21 and 1.0% for customer accounts paid off by January 15th. South
accounts, 3.0% for customer accounts paid off by December 18, 2.0% for
customer accounts paid off by January 8 and 1.0% for customer accounts paid
off by January 31st.

Customer Support:

The Company provides customers personalized service with their farm input
needs throughout the entire crop growing cycle.  The Company's account
managers provide information on the availability and use of various
chemicals, fertilizers and seed, while the ultimate decision of product
choice is made by the customer.  The Company's account managers discuss
with customers the efficient use of farm inputs, cost-effective fertility
and weed control programs, product availability, pricing and delivery.
When orders are received, the Company coordinates the customer's needs
and delivery requirements with the appropriate suppliers.  The Company
also generally schedules at least one or two visits to the customer's
farm to inspect the growing crop and to discuss harvest plans and any
pertinent problems during the growing cycle.  The Company provides
each customer a detailed monthly statement to simplify the customer's
bookkeeping for all farm inputs purchased from the Company throughout
each growing season.

Credit Policy and Customer Notes:

The Company has established a credit policy with procedures for credit
review and approval.  Each new customer and customers from prior years
must provide financial and credit information to the Company.  If a
customer is approved by the Company for credit, the Company will generally
extend credit from 80% to 95% of the insured value of that customer's
planned crop, based on his multi-peril insurance coverage.  The Company
secures its position principally by obtaining a first lien position
on the crop and by receiving an assignment of the farmer's multi-peril
crop insurance and government farm program payments, if available.
For certain customers, the Company's lien on the crop might be
subordinate to one or more prior liens, which would directly reduce
the amount of credit available to that customer.  The Company obtains
a current credit report or search to verify the priority of the
Company's lien.  The Company also contacts customer references, and
for larger accounts, the Company may visit the prospective customer's
farm to review farm operations before extending credit.

                                  -6-
<PAGE>

In conjunction with the loans discussed above, the Company also offers
crop input-only financing on a limited basis and has a portfolio of
intermediate term loans.  Crop input-only notes are typically
unsecured and are used by the Company's customers as a source for
financing seed, chemicals and/or fertilizer from various national
manufacturers and suppliers.  Crop input-only notes are due in the
fall of the year following harvest.  Intermediate term loans range
from one to five years in length and are secured with machinery
and equipment and/or real estate.

The Company's principal assets are its notes receivable from customers
who finance their purchase of farm inputs with the "AGriflex Credit"
program from the Company throughout the crop growing cycle.  At
February 28, 2003 and February 28, 2002, the total outstanding customer
notes receivable were $281,250,000 and $268,747,000, respectively.
For the years ended February 28, 2003 and February 28, 2002, there
were no individual customers whose accounts were 5% or more of the
Company's total customer notes receivable at year-end.

Each customer account is assigned to an employee of the Company. The
accounts are monitored for collection, during harvest season, under
the supervision of the Company's account managers.   The Company's
employees generally contact their respective assigned customers biweekly
during the harvest season.  Through this process, the Company obtains
information from customers concerning crop yields, marketing strategy,
number of acres harvested and the location of the customers' stored
crops.  If a customer has a claim under his multi-peril crop insurance,
the Company will take steps to assure that the claim has been properly
and timely filed.  Under the Company's credit arrangements, when a
customer sells his crop, the customer is required to obtain the sale
proceeds by check, payable to both the customer and the Company, and
forward the check to the Company as endorsed by the customer.  Upon
receipt of the check, the Company applies the proceeds as a payment on
the customer's account and forwards any overpayments to the customer.
The Company does not retain customer funds on deposit.  If a customer
is to receive all or a portion of the value of his crop through a
multi-peril crop insurance claim or farm program payment, the collection
of that customer's account could be delayed pending receipt of those
payments.

Some customers may wish to store their crops for later sale, or for other
reasons may not pay their accounts in full when due.  The Company monitors
and documents its collateral and collection position on all accounts on
an ongoing basis.  The Company will informally extend the payment of a
customer's note receivable to accommodate a customer's crop marketing
requirements if the Company determines that there continues to be
sufficient collateral. Therefore, a customer's note receivable that
is past due may not be past due because of a customer's inability
to pay or collateral impairment.  The amount of customer notes
receivable that were past due (including notes extended by the Company)
at February 28, 2003 and February 28, 2002 was $174,031,000 and
$140,364,000, respectively.  The amount of past due customer notes
receivable increased slightly from 86.6% of net revenues in Fiscal 2002
to 87.9% in Fiscal 2003, primarily as a result of an increase in the
amount of customers utilizing an extended marketing cycle.  This increase
in past due customer notes receivable was in line with the Company's
expectations.  The increased dollar amount of past due customer notes
receivable has not had a material adverse affect on the Company's earnings,
and management does not believe that this increase will have a material
adverse affect on earnings or the Company's ability to supply and finance
farm inputs in the future.

                                   -7-
<PAGE>

The Company also continually evaluates and classifies each customer account
based on collateral and expected timing of collection in determining its
allowance for doubtful notes.  At February 28, 2003 and February 28, 2002,
the Company's allowance for doubtful notes was $12,300,000 and $9,500,000,
respectively.

Sales and Marketing:

The Company markets its Agriflex Credit program through advertising, including
direct mail and telemarketing, customer solicitation and referrals,
including cooperative marketing efforts with several major seed and
fertilizer suppliers which allow the Company to market its program
through their dealer networks.  In addition, as of May 25, 2003, the
Company employs twenty-one full time salaried sales people.  The sales
representatives identify prospective customers and assist in obtaining
customer information for the Company's credit review and approval.
After the Company has approved a customer, the Company's employees
begin to service the customer's account generally without assistance
from the sales representatives.

Powerfarm:

The Company continues to leverage its business model and use of its credit
products via the Internet through Powerfarm.com. The site highlights
Ag Services credit programs and allows farmers to apply for credit lines
electronically.  In addition, existing customers have the ability to access
detailed account information 24 hours a day through the site.

Seasonal Factors:

The sale of farm inputs is seasonal with approximately 75% of revenues
being generated from March 1 through August 31 of each year.

Credit Facilities:

Due to the seasonality of the Company's revenues and the terms of its
customer notes receivable, the Company is required to finance the carrying
of its revenues as notes receivable for a majority of its fiscal year.

The Company's business and its growth are dependent on adequate credit
to finance its sales of farm inputs to farmers.  The Company uses its
capital, trade credit and bank and commercial paper borrowings to finance
farm input purchases.  The terms of the Company's trade credit vary for
each supplier and type of farm input and may require a lien on certain
assets of the Company.

In November 2002 the Company negotiated amendments to its asset backed
securitized financing program to extend the due date to May 2003, with
a subsequent extention to June 2003.  This program is currently in a
wind down phase, which calls for an orderly collection of the notes
receivable and pay down of the outstanding borrowings.  This facility
does not allow for the financing of 2003 Crop Year receivables.  The
Company also maintains a $75 million revolving line of credit facility,
which was also amended in November 2002 to extend its due date to
March 31, 2003.  Subsequent to year-end, this facility was reduced to
$65 million and extended to June 2003.  This facility also does not
allow for the financing of 2003 Crop Year receivables.  The Company
currently has a $200 million revolving line of credit for the 2003

                                   -8-
<PAGE>

crop year that expires in December 2003.  The maximum amount available
under the revolving line of credit is subject to a borrowing base
computation as provided by the agreement.  The Company has also
negotiated participation agreements with two financial institutions
whereby these financial institutions can finance up to $23.0 million
in customer receivables.  If the Company were not able to maintain a
sufficient line of credit or other credit facility, the Company would
not be able to finance sufficient sales of farm inputs, which would
have a material adverse affect on the Company's business and its growth.
(see "Risk Factors")

Competition:

The Company faces competition from many types of suppliers of farm
inputs, including manufacturers' dealers, independent distributors
and suppliers, and farm cooperatives.  Farm input financing is
competitive and, in recent years, several large agricultural supply
companies have provided financing for various farm inputs.  Many of
the Company's competitors are considerably larger and better
capitalized, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to compete effectively against such competitors in the future.
Within this competitive environment, the Company competes
principally on the basis of its competitive pricing, broad range of
farm inputs offered and the convenience of its financing.

Major Customers:

The customer base is sufficiently broad that no customer accounts for
10% or more of the Company's revenues.

Backlog Orders:

Although the Company had approximately $101,014,000 in commitments
to supply farm input financing, there was no material sales backlog
as of February 28, 2003.

Government Regulation:

Farm input financing and cash advances are subject to certain state
laws governing money brokers, federal and states truth-in-lending
regulations, and state usury laws limiting interest rates for certain
types of customers.  Additional laws and regulations could be
implemented in the future governing the Company's financing
activities for the sale of farm inputs and cash advances or other
aspects of the Company's business.  Compliance with these laws and
regulations may adversely affect the Company's operations and costs.

The sale of certain farm inputs, including agricultural chemicals and
pesticides is subject to certain federal and state environmental rules
and regulations.  The Company holds licenses necessary for the sale
of these products.  The Company also serves as an agent for the sale
of multi-peril crop insurance and has twenty-seven employees with
the required insurance agent's license.

Employees:

As of February 28, 2003, the Company had 158 full time employees,
including eleven executive positions, four in product specialization
and distribution, fifty-four in credit review and approval, five in

                                 -9-
<PAGE>

multi-peril crop insurance sales, eighteen in accounting and
administration, thirteen in information systems, fourteen in legal and
collection and thirty-nine in sales and marketing.  None of the Company's
employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  The Company
considers its relations with its employees to be good.

Subsequent to year end, the Company has taken certain cost cutting
measures in response to a smaller customer portfolio for the 2003
crop year.  Among other cutbacks, the Company reduced its workforce
by approximately 30% in May 2003.

Company Website:

The Company maintains a website with the address www.agservices.com.
The Company is not including the information contained on its website
as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  The Company makes available free of charge through its
website its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material
with, or furnishes such material to, the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Risk Factors:

Availability of Credit to Finance Farm Inputs.  The Company's principal
source of revenues, which accounted for at least 77% of net revenue
over the past three fiscal years, is the sale of farm inputs to farmers.
If a farmer does not have sufficient cash resources to cover farm
input costs until the sale of the crops after harvest, he must finance
his purchase of farm inputs throughout the crop growing cycle.  To
facilitate the sale of farm inputs, the Company offers its customers
financing during the entire growing season for each crop.  For the
fiscal years ended February 28, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
financed its purchase of farm inputs from the following sources
in the respective percentages indicated:  bank and corporate lines
of credit 82.5%, 78.6% and 79.2%; trade credit 3.9%, 3.3% and 4.3%;
and equity 13.6%, 18.1% and 16.5%.  If the Company is not able to
obtain and maintain sufficient lines of credit, the Company would
not be able to finance sufficient sales of farm inputs, which would
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

As of May 15, 2003, the Company has arranged for financing for the 2003
crop year of approximately $220 million, which allows for customer
financing for the 2003 crop year of up to $255 million.  This
compares to total 2002 crop year customer financing of approximately
$465 million.  This credit facility and the revolving credit facility
(which financed 2002 crop loans and can not be used to fund 2003 crop
year loans) expire in June 2003 unless certain actions are taken,
including a capital investment as described below.  There can be no
assurance the Company will be successful in securing additional
financing and, if financing is secured, it may be on terms less
favorable than current terms.

The Company is taking action in order to secure additional financing.
The Company has entered into a securities purchase agreement with
American Securities Capital Partners, L.P. (ASCP) whereby ASCP has
agreed to invest up to $70 million in capital in the Company, of
which $35 million would be immediately available.  The Company

                                -10-
<PAGE>

believes this transaction will assist in arranging for the needed
financing.  The securities purchase agreement is subject to certain
conditions, including shareholder approval.  Finalization of this
transaction is not assured.

In the event that the ASCP transaction does not close and alternative
financing cannot be arranged, the Company may be left with limited
options.  Failure to obtain new financing would materially impair the
Company's ability to continue operations under the normal course of
business and could have a material adverse impact upon the Company.

Security and Collection of Customer Notes Receivable.  The Company's
principal asset is its notes receivable from customers who finance
their purchase of farm inputs from the Company throughout the crop
growing cycle.  The Company currently secures its position principally
by obtaining a first lien position on the crop and by receiving an
assignment of the farmer's multi-peril crop insurance and an assignment
of government farm program payments, if available.  For certain
customers, the Company's lien on the crop might be subordinate to one
or more prior liens.  Agricultural co-ops and other suppliers of farm
inputs who provide financing for their particular brands of farm inputs
typically obtain a lien on the crop or assets sold but do not generally
require a lien on farm land or equipment.  Since the Company finances
the purchase of farm inputs on a short-term basis through the crop
growing and marketing cycle, the Company also generally does not require
that customers provide a lien on farm land or equipment.  Although
the Company's credit policies include taking action necessary to
preserve its lien and rights to a customer's crop, if the Company
fails to perfect its lien or if a customer commits fraud, including
the improper sale of crop to a bona fide purchaser, the Company may
have difficulty preserving its lien rights.  In addition, if a farmer
does not engage in proper farming practices, the multi-peril crop
insurance may not be available.

The Company also has a portfolio of intermediate term loans with repayment
terms ranging from one to five years.  These intermediate term loans
were used to finance machinery and equipment and/or real estate.  The
Company typically takes a first lien position on the corresponding
collateral.  In addition to the above financing programs the Company
also offers a crop-input only financing program whereby the Company
finances customers' purchases of seed, chemical and/or fertilizer only
from certain national manufacturers and suppliers.  These notes are
typically unsecured and repayment terms are generally in fall of the
year following harvest.

The Company reviews its customer notes receivable monthly and classifies
each customer note receivable into one or more of the following five
classifications:  "acceptable," "other loans especially mentioned (OLEM),"
"substandard," "doubtful" and "loss."  Although the Company believes it
has made adequate provision in its Financial Statements for probable
losses on these receivables, the value of the Company's collateral may
fluctuate due to the variability of crop and fixed asset values over
time, which could adversely affect the adequacy of the Company's
reserve for doubtful notes.

From time to time, there is a concentration of large customer accounts.
If one or more large customer accounts does not repay their account in
full, this could have a material adverse effect on the earnings of the
Company.

Availability of Government Underwritten Multi-Peril Crop Insurance.
The Company currently secures its position principally by obtaining
a lien on the crop and by receiving an assignment of the farmer's
multi-peril crop insurance and government farm program payments, if

                                  -11-
<PAGE>

available.  Multi-peril crop insurance attaches only if the crop
is properly planted by a previously established date.  If the insurance
underwriter determined that a farmer did not engage in proper farming
practices, or if a farmer did not plant his crop on a timely basis
(other than as a result from weather), multi-peril crop insurance
coverage could be denied.  While various forms of federal multi-peril
crop insurance have been in existence since 1938, federal farm policies
and funding are subject to periodic change, and there can be no
assurance that the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation ("FCIC") or
any other federal agency will continue to underwrite multi-peril crop
insurance on an ongoing basis.  If the Company's customers were not
able to obtain multi-peril crop insurance through some combination
of the FCIC or private insurance carriers at a reasonable cost, the
Company would be required to seek alternative collateral from its
customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
net revenues.

Reduction of Financing Volume.  For the 2003 Crop Year the Company has
had to turn down a substantial amount of customers the Company previously
financed due to limitations in credit facilities.  There is no assurance
that the Company will be able to get these customers back in the future
or be able to replace them with new customers.  This reduction in
customer volume could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business.

Agricultural Industry Cycles.  Because all of the Company's customers
are engaged in farming, the Company is subject to weather and agricultural
industry cycles.  The sale of farm inputs is seasonal based on the crop
growing cycle.  Farm input costs, crop prices, interest rates and credit
availability for agricultural lending are all subject to fluctuations
from time to time based on market conditions, weather, and the United
States and world economics.

The agricultural crop production industry is currently going through a
consolidation phase which is reducing the number of viable farming
operations.  Currently, this is increasing the demand for credit
throughout the industry.  Further consolidation could change the need
for financing in agriculture in the future, which could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's net revenues.

Competition.  Although the Company is not currently aware of other
companies which provide the same range of farm inputs and financing
currently provided by the Company, many different companies provide
one or more of the Company's products.  The Company faces competition
from many types of suppliers of farm inputs, including manufacturers'
dealers, independent distributors and suppliers, and farm cooperatives.
Commercial banks, the Farm Credit System and other agricultural
lenders compete with the Company for farm input financing.  Farm input
financing is competitive and, in recent years, several large
agricultural supply companies and cooperatives, including Pioneer Hi-Bred
International Inc., Deere Credit and Cenex/Land O'Lakes, have provided
financing for various farm inputs.  Many of the Company's competitors
are considerably larger and better capitalized, and there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to compete effectively against
its competitors in the future.

Dependence on Key Officers.  The success of the Company is dependent
on its President, Henry C. Jungling, Jr., its Chairman of the Board,
Gaylen D. Miller, its Chief Executive Officer and Secretary,
Kevin D. Schipper and its Chief Operating Officer, Shawn R. Smeins.
The loss of the services of these officers could have a material
adverse effect on the business of the Company.

                                  -12-
<PAGE>

Government Regulation.  Farm input financing, including cash advances,
is subject to certain state laws governing money brokers, federal and
state truth in lending regulations, and state usury laws limiting
interest rates for certain types of customers.  The sale of certain
farm inputs, including agricultural chemicals and pesticides, is
subject to certain federal and state environmental rules and regulations.
The Company also is subject to insurance agency regulations for its
sale of multi-peril crop insurance.  Additional laws and regulations
could be implemented in the future governing the Company's financing
activities for the sale of farm inputs, including cash advances, or
other aspects of the Company's business.  Compliance with these laws
and regulations may adversely affect the Company's operations and costs.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

During Fiscal 2001 the Company was granted land by the City of
Cedar Falls, Iowa to construct new headquarters.  The construction
of the Company's new corporate headquarters was completed in
February of 2002. The new headquarters, aggregating approximately
60,000 square feet, is located in Cedar Falls, Iowa.  The land and
building are used as security for the Company's outstanding credit
agreements.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is named in lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of such lawsuits,
in the opinion of management the outcomes will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.  The Company
maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

Stockholders

As of February 28, 2003, the Company had 114 stockholders of record
and approximately 2,000 stockholders for whom securities firms acted
as nominees.

Dividends

The holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends when
and as declared by the Board of Directors.  However, other than
dividends paid prior to September 1989 to its then parent corporation,
which was subsequently merged into the Company, the Company has not
paid a cash dividend on its common stock.  The Company does not
anticipate payment of any cash dividends in the foreseeable future
on its common stock.  The Company presently intends to retain earnings
to finance growth.  The Company's current borrowing agreements contain
covenants that prohibit the declaration or payment of dividends.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial
Statements of the Company, the related notes thereto and Selected Financial
Data included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Financing and Going Concern Matters

The availability of lines of credit is essential to the Company's operations.
As of May 15, 2003, the Company has arranged for financing for the 2003 crop
year of approximately $220 million, which allows for customer financing for
the 2003 crop year of up to $255 million.  This compares to total 2002 crop
year customer financing of approximately $465 million.  This credit facility
and the revolving credit facility (which financed 2002 crop loans and can
not be used to fund 2003 crop year loans) expire in June 2003 unless
certain actions are taken, including a capital investment as described below.
There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in securing
additional financing and, if financing is secured, it may be on terms
less favorable than current terms.

The Company is taking action in order to secure additional financing.  As
described below, the Company has entered into a securities purchase
agreement with American Securities Capital Partners, L.P. (ASCP) whereby
ASCP has agreed to invest up to $70 million in capital in the Company, of
which $35 million would be immediately available.  The Company believes
this transaction will assist in arranging for the needed financing.
The securities purchase agreement is subject to certain conditions, including
shareholder approval.  Finalization of this transaction is not assured.

In the event that the ASCP transaction does not close and alternative
financing cannot be arranged, the Company may be left with limited options.
Failure to obtain new financing would materially impair the Company's
ability to continue operations under the normal course of business and
could have a material adverse impact upon the Company.

The Company entered into a securities purchase agreement during February 2003
with ASCP, a New York private-equity investment firm, under which ASCP has
agreed to invest up to $70 million in the Company in exchange for convertible
preferred stock.  The agreement contemplates that ASCP will contribute up
to $70 million in three annual installments; the first payment of $35 million
is subject, among other things, to satisfactory completion of due diligence,
the Company arranging for long-term financing and shareholder approval.  The
second and third payments are conditional upon the Company achieving certain
economic thresholds.  At this time, management does not believe it will meet
these economic thresholds.  ASCP will have voting control of the Company
after the initial funding.

The parties are presently conducting due diligence, negotiating final terms
and documentation.  If the transaction is consummated, current shareholders
will incur dilution.  There can be no assurance at this time that this

                               -16-
<PAGE>

investment will be consummated.  The Company is considering various
alternatives in the event that the transaction is not completed.

In addition to the ASCP transaction, the Company has undertaken certain
actions to continue operations at a reduced level of revenue.  The Company
is anticipating that the $220 million credit facility will allow for
customer financing for the 2003 crop year of up to $255 million as
compared to 2002 crop year financing of $465 million.  Because of the
timing of these crop loans the Company will need to operate for the
2003 crop year on this lower level of activity.  Management believes
that this level of activity will be adequate to sustain operations in
this transition year.

The Company has also implemented a cost reduction program which will help
to mitigate the effects of the reduced financing capabilities of the Company.
Among other cutbacks, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately
30% in May 2003.  Management believes that it will be able to regain some
of the market share lost as a result of the inability to provide financing
to customers for the 2003 year.  Management also believes that with the cost
reduction program that was implemented and the consummation of the ASCP
capital investment, the Company will be able to obtain long-term financing
without suffering irrecoverable losses due to the reduced lending
capabilities.  No assurance can be given that the Company would be
successful in these efforts.

Critical Accounting Policies

The "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations," and disclosures included within this report,
are based on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements.
These statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The
financial information contained in these statements is, for the most
part, based on approximate measures of the financial effects of
transactions and events that have already occurred.  However, the
preparation of these statements requires management to make certain
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses.

The Company's significant accounting policies are described in the
"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".  Based on its
consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex
and subjective estimates and judgments, management has identified
its most critical accounting policy to be that related to the
allowance for doubtful notes.

The allowance for doubtful notes is established through a provision
for doubtful notes charged to expense.  Loans are charged against
the allowance for doubtful notes when management believes that
collectibility of the customer receivable is unlikely.  The Company
has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit
quality of its loan portfolio including timely identification of
potential problem credits.  On a quarterly basis, management reviews
the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses incorporating
a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative.
Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss
experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values,
known information about individual loans and other factors.
Qualitative factors include the general economic environment in
the Company's market area and the expected trend of those economic
conditions.  To the extent actual results differ from forecasts
and management's judgment, the allowance for doubtful notes may be
greater or less than future charge-offs.

General

Net revenues increased 22% to $197.9 million for Fiscal 2003 as compared
to $162.0 million in Fiscal 2002.  Net income increased 8% to $5.9 million
in 2003 from $5.5 million in 2002.  The Company reported basic and diluted
earnings per share of $1.08 and $1.07 for Fiscal 2003, respectively,
compared to $1.01 and $1.00 per share, respectively, in Fiscal 2002.

Net Revenues

The Company reclassified its revenues in the current fiscal year to present
revenues associated with the cash advances for fuel, irrigation, land
rents and other farm inputs and revenues associated with the input only
program on a net reporting basis in contrast to the previously presented

                                -18-
<PAGE>

gross reporting basis. All information provided in the "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
is based upon the new revenue reporting basis.  The input only program
is a financing program provided by the Company for various suppliers and
manufacturers.  The Company has decided to report its revenue in this
manner because it believes it is a preferable presentation under current
generally accepted accounting principles.  This presentation has the
impact of reducing farm input revenues and cost of farm input revenues
from previously reported amounts by approximately $268.1 million,
$225.4 million and $177.2 million for the years ended February 28, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.  This presentation has no impact on future
or past earnings of the Company.

Net revenues in Fiscal 2003 increased 22% to $197.9 million, compared with
$162.0 million in 2002, and $168.5 million in 2001.  The Company reached
record level of revenues in 2003 as a result of strong demand for the
Company's Agri-Flex Credit(R)Financing Program and an excellent spring
planting season in its primary market area.  Financing income as a
percentage of net revenues decreased to 14.8% in Fiscal 2003 from 16.4%
in 2002 and 18.9% in 2001.  The decrease in financing income as a
percentage of net revenues for Fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of a
decrease in the average prime lending rate over the prior year of
approximately 165 basis points, which is the base rate used by the
Company to charge interest on a variable rate basis to its customers.
The decrease in financing income as a percentage of net revenues for
Fiscal 2002 over Fiscal 2001 was primarily a result of a decrease in
the prime-lending rate by approximately 300 basis points.  For the last
three fiscal years over 95% of the Company's customers have had
variable rate notes, which allows the Company to pass interest rate
risk onto its customers.

In addition to financing income, net revenues primarily consist of farm
inputs, including seed, agricultural chemicals and fertilizer.  Customer
fees consist of program fees and insurance brokerage services.
Net revenue for the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002 are
summarized below.

Cost of Revenues

The total cost of revenues was 87.6% of net revenues for Fiscal 2003,
which increased from 86.7% of net revenues in 2002, which increased from
85.3% of net revenues in 2001. The increase in the total cost of revenues
as a percentage of net revenues in Fiscal 2003 was a result of increased
financing expenses.  The gross margin on net revenues increased to 6.3%
in 2003 from 6.0% in 2002 and 5.8% in 2001 while the gross margin on
financing decreased to 6.6% in 2003 from 7.8% in 2002 and 8.8% in 2001.
The decrease in gross margin on financing is due to a decrease in the
average prime lending rate by approximately 165 basis points and to

                                 -19-
<PAGE>

additional fees and pricing increases paid by the Company in connection
with the extension of the Company's credit facilities.  These fees and
increased pricing had the effect of raising the Company's cost of funds
by 112 basis points or approximately $3.7 million when compared to
Fiscal 2002.  Financing expense, as a cost of revenue, is directly
affected by changes in the prevailing prime, LIBOR and commercial paper
interest rates under the Company's financing agreements.  The Company
establishes interest rates for customers each year based on the Company's
anticipated financing expenses and competitive influences in the market.
For Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company offered variable rate notes
to customers ranging from prime to 4.0% above prime.  The provision for
doubtful notes, as a percentage of net revenues, remained constant at
4.6% in Fiscal 2003 and 2002, increasing from 3.7% in Fiscal 2001.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses have remained relatively constant at 7.7% of net
revenues in Fiscal 2003 as compared to 7.8% for Fiscal 2002, which
increased from 7.6% for Fiscal 2001.  The increase in the dollar amount
of operating expenses is attributed to the Company's growth and increased
incentive compensation related to higher Company earnings.

Manpower expenses increased to $10.3 million in Fiscal 2003 from
$8.6 million in 2002 and $8.3 million in 2001.  This is a result of
the Company adding employees as well as general wage rate increases
to existing employees and increased incentive compensation related
to higher Company earnings.  The balance of the increase in operating
expenses is attributed to the Company's growth.

Net Income

Net income increased 8% to $5.9 million in Fiscal 2003, compared with
$5.5 million in 2002, which decreased from $7.5 million in 2001.  The
increase in net income is primarily attributable to the increase in
volume of the Company's AgriFlex Credit program, which was offset by
additional financing expenses incurred by the Company during Fiscal 2003.

Powerfarm

The Company continues to leverage its business model and use of its credit
products via the Internet through Powerfarm.com.  The site highlights
Ag Services credit programs and allows farmers to apply for credit
lines electronically.  In addition, existing customers have the ability
to access detailed account information 24 hours a day through the site.

Seasonality

The Company's revenues and income are directly related to the growing
cycle for crops.  Accordingly, quarterly revenues and income vary during
each fiscal year.  The following table shows the Company's quarterly net
revenues and net income for Fiscal 2003 and 2002. This information is
derived from unaudited financial statements, which include, in the
opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments which
management considers necessary for a fair statement of results of
those periods.  The operating results for any quarter are not
necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.

Inflation

The Company does not believe the Company's net revenues and income
from continuing operations were significantly impacted by inflation or
changing prices in Fiscal 2003, 2002, or 2001.

Adoption of Financial Accounting Standard

Effective March 1, 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133").
FAS 133 requires that all derivative financial instruments that qualify
for hedge accounting, such as interest rate swap contracts, be recognized
in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the
purpose or intent for holding them.  Changes in fair value of derivative
financial instruments are either recognized periodically in income or
stockholder's equity (as a component of comprehensive income), depending
on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in fair value or
cash flows.  The adoption of FAS 133 did not have a material effect on
the primary financial statements, but did increase Fiscal 2003
comprehensive income by $0.2 million and reduced Fiscal 2002
comprehensive income by $1.4 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Described below are various matters related to the Company's liquidity
and capital resources.  This section should be read in conjunction with
the description of the Company's financing issues as described in
"Financing and Going Concern Matters".

Due to the seasonality of the Company's revenues and the terms of its
customer notes receivable, the Company is required to finance the carrying
of its revenues as customer notes receivable, for a majority of its fiscal
year.  As a result, the Company's need for capital has increased
significantly due to its rapid growth.  At February 28, 2003 and 2002,
the Company had approximately $101 million and $153 million respectively,
in commitments to supply farm inputs.

The Company has funded its operating requirements and growth through
a combination of retained earnings, equity capital, trade credit and bank
and commercial paper borrowings.  For the Fiscal years ended
February 28, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company financed its purchase of farm
inputs from the following sources in the respective percentages indicated:
bank and commercial paper borrowings 82.5%, 78.6% and 79.2%; trade credit
3.9%, 3.3% and 4.3%; and equity 13.6%, 18.1% and 16.5%.  The increase in
bank and commercial paper borrowings as a percentage of farm input purchases
was a result of the Company's ability to leverage its equity through the

                                  -21-
<PAGE>

more favorable terms of bank and commercial paper borrowings. Capital
expenditures have been financed through bank borrowings. The Company's
principal source of working capital has been bank and commercial paper
borrowings, retained earnings, a $2.5 million sale of common stock by
the Company in April 1990, the $4.7 million from its initial public
offering of common stock in August 1991, and the $12.9 million from
its convertible subordinated debenture offering in April 1993, which
was converted to common stock in Fiscal 1997.

At February 28, 2003 the Company had working capital of $18.1 million,
a decrease of $1.0 million since February 28, 2002.  The components
of this net decrease, since February 28, 2002, were (i) $1.0 million
decrease resulting from operating activities, consisting of
approximately $5.9 million in net income, $0.7 million in depreciation,
$1.6 million in amortization, and the remainder from a net change in
other working capital items, (ii) capital expenditures of approximately
$1.3 million related to the acquisition of equipment and furniture
and offset by (iii) net proceeds of $0.1 million from the issuance
of common stock upon exercise of options.

The Company negotiated a $200 million revolving line of credit for
the 2003 Crop Year that expires in December 2003.  The terms of the
agreement allow for two variable interest rate alternatives based on
LIBOR or prime (current effective rates range from 3.875% to 5.50% at
February 28, 2003).  The total amount outstanding under the revolving
line of credit at February 28, 2003 was $57.1 million.
At February 28, 2003 the Company had a maximum amount available under
the line of credit of approximately $2.8 million based on a borrowing
base computation provided by the agreement.  This line of credit
contains a provision which accelerates the due date to June 15, 2003
in the event the Company does not receive an equity investment from ASCP.
The Company anticipates that it will not meet this provision and the
line of credit will be extended to meet the timing of the expected ASCP
equity investment.  There can be no assurance that the Company will get
this extension.

The Company has negotiated amendments to its asset backed securitized
financing program to extend the due date to June 2003 from November 2002.
This facility does not allow for the financing of 2003 Crop Year
receivables.  This program is currently in a wind down phase, which
calls for an orderly collection of the notes receivable and pay down
of the outstanding borrowings.  Ag Acceptance (the Company's wholly-owned,
special purpose corporation) pledges its interest in these notes receivable
to a commercial paper market conduit entity which incurs interest at
variable rates in the commercial paper market (current effective rates
range from 1.27% to 1.31% at February 28, 2003) and the remaining portion
is a term note with interest at a variable cost of LIBOR plus 50 basis
points (current effective rate is 1.83% at February 28, 2003).  The total
outstanding under the asset backed securitized financing program at
February 28, 2003 and 2002 was $52.4 million and $132.5 million, respectively.

The Company's $75 million revolving line of credit facility was also
amended in November 2002 to extend its due date to March 31, 2003.
Subsequent to year-end, this facility was reduced to $65 million and
extended to June 2003.  This facility also does not allow for the
financing of 2003 Crop Year receivables.  Additional terms of the
agreement allow a variable interest rate based on prime (current
effective rate is 7.25% at February 28, 2003).  The total outstanding
under this facility at February 28, 2003 and 2002 was $53.5 million and
$45.0 million, respectively.

                                  -22-
<PAGE>

All borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of
the Company.  The agreements as discussed above contain various
restrictive covenants, including, among others, restrictions on mergers,
issuance of stock, declaration or payment of dividends, transactions
with affiliates, loans to stockholders, and requirements that the
Company maintain certain levels of equity and pretax earnings. These
restrictions are in effect unless written consent is obtained.
Advances under the agreements are also subject to portfolio performance,
financial covenant restrictions, and borrowing base calculations.  The
Company was in violation of one covenant at February 28, 2003, however,
the note holders have waived this violation.

In June 2002, the Company negotiated a credit facility with a financial
institution whereby the Company participates certain customer notes
receivable to this institution effective through January 2004.  Advances
and repayments under this credit agreement are based on and collateralized
by the performance of these customer notes receivable.  This agreement
accrues interest based on the variable interest rates of the underlying
customer notes receivables ranging from prime to 2.5% over prime (current
effective rates range from 4.25% to 6.75%).  At February 28, 2003 the
Company had $11.6 million outstanding under the agreement.

The Company has a credit agreement whereby the Company may borrow up
to $3.8 million, with a declining balance provision, on a revolving line
of credit through April 2022.  This credit agreement was used to finance
the Company's corporate headquarters at a fixed interest rate of 5.74%
through November 2006.  At February 28, 2003 and 2002, the Company had
$2.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, outstanding under the credit
agreement.  The agreement also contains various restrictive financial
covenants.

In February 2002, three executive officers of the Company, who are
also the original founders of the Company, loaned an aggregate of
$4.4 million to the Company.  The due date has been extended to June 2003.
The Company makes monthly interest payments to these officers at a variable
interest rate of 0.5% below the prime rate (current effective rate is 3.75%
at February 28, 2003).  These notes are collateralized by a second mortgage
on the Company's corporate headquarters.

The Company maintains an interest-rate risk-management strategy that
uses derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings
fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility.  The Company's specific
goal is to lower (where possible) the cost of its borrowed funds.

In July 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
with an original notional amount of $30 million.  The current notional amount
of $22.5 million decreases by $7.5 million annually in each July 2003, 2004
and 2005. The swap is utilized to manage interest rate exposures and is
designated as a cash flow hedge.  The swap agreement is a variable
receive/fixed pay swap, which expires in July 2005 and has the effect of
converting the interest rate paid on the notional amount of the Company's
variable rate debt to a fixed rate of 9.78%.  The differential to be paid
or received on the swap agreement is recognized and accrued over the life
of the agreement as other comprehensive income based on the remaining
outstanding notional amount or changes in interest rates. Included in other
comprehensive income at February 28, 2003 and 2002 is a loss of approximately

                                  -23-
<PAGE>

$1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively.  The difference between the
Company's actual variable interest expense and 9.78% on the notional amount
for the next twelve months is reclassified from other comprehensive income
and recognized as interest expense.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

At February 28, 2003, the Company had $183.7 million outstanding in notes
payable at an average variable interest rate of 4.87%.   The Company has
an interest rate swap which effectively converts $30 million of this variable
rate debt to a fixed rate instrument.  The Company also has a building loan
with a fixed rate of interest.  After considering the effect of the swap
and the building loan, the Company has floating rate debt of $156.5 million
at a variable interest rate of 4.15%.  A 10% increase in the average
variable interest rate would increase interest expense by approximately
41 basis points.  Assuming similar average outstanding borrowings for
Fiscal 2002 of $331 million, this would increase the Company's interest
expense by approximately $1,357,000.

The above sensitivity analysis is to provide information about the
Company's potential market risks as they pertain to an adverse change in
interest rates.  The above analysis excludes the positive impact that
increased interest rates would have on financing income as more than 95%
of the Company's notes receivable are variable rate notes.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995

Information contained in this report, other than historical information,
should be considered forward looking, which reflect Management's current
views of future events and financial performance that involve a number of
risks and uncertainties.  The factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially include, but are not limited to, the following: general
economic conditions within the agricultural industry; competitive factors
and pricing pressures; changes in product mix; changes in the seasonality
of demand patterns; changes in weather conditions; changes in agricultural
regulations; and other risks detailed in the Company's Securities and
Exchange Commission filings.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

At February 28, 2003 the Company had $183.7 million outstanding in
notes payable at an average variable interest rate of 4.87%.  The
Company has an interest rate swap which effectively converts
$22.5 million of this variable rate debt to a fixed rate instrument.
The Company also has a building loan with a fixed rate of interest.
After considering the effect of the swap and the building loan,
the Company has floating rate debt of $156.5 million at a variable
interest rate of 4.15%.  A 10% increase in the average variable
interest rate would increase interest expense by approximately 41 basis
points.  Assuming similar average variable rate outstanding borrowings
for Fiscal 2003 of $331 million, the Company's interest expense would
increase by approximately $1,357,000.

The above sensitivity analysis is to provide information about the
Company's potential market risks as they pertain to an adverse change
in interest rates.  The above analysis excludes the positive impact
that increased interest rates would have on financing income, as 95%
of the Company's notes receivable are variable rate notes.

ITEM 14.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

During the 90-day period prior to the filing date of this report, management,
including the Company's President, Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures.  Based upon, and as of the date of that
evaluation, the President, Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material
respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported as and when required.

There have been no significant changes in the Company's internal controls or
in other factors which could significantly affect internal controls
subsequent to the date the Company carried out its evaluation.  There were
no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses identified in the
evaluation and therefore, no corrective actions were taken.

                 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
                    ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES


To the Board of Directors
Ag Services of America, Inc.
Cedar Falls, Iowa

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.  The consolidated
supplemental schedule II is presented for purpose of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not a part of the
basic consolidated financial statements.  This schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the
basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly
stated in all material respects in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole.

Our report covering the basic consolidated financial statements indicates
that there is substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern, the outcome of which cannot presently be determined and
that the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Certified Public Accountants


                      INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


To the Board of Directors
Ag Services of America, Inc.
Cedar Falls, Iowa

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ag Services
of America, Inc. as of February 28, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for the years ended February 28, 2003, 2002, and 2001.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Ag Services of America, Inc. as of February 28, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended
February 28, 2003, 2002, and 2001 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 4
to the financial statements, the Company depends on lines of credit to
finance its operations and has been unable to secure long term financing
beyond June 2003.  As described in Note 2, the Company has entered into an
agreement to raise additional equity and is pursuing the acquisition of
long term financing, however, if the Company is unable to obtain new financing,
it may be unable to repay its debts in the normal course of business,
and continue normal operations.  This raises substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.

As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
consolidated statements of income for 2002 and 2001 have been reclassified
to present certain farm inputs revenue and cost of revenue on a net basis
rather than on a gross basis.

                       AG SERVICES OF AMERICA, INC.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.	Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of business:

The Company's operations consist primarily of the retail sale of farm
inputs to agricultural producers located throughout the United States
through direct financing of these farm inputs on credit terms that the
Company establishes for its customers.

Basis of presentation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ag Services
of America, Inc. (the Company) and its subsidiaries, Ag Acceptance
Corporation and Powerfarm, Inc., which are wholly-owned.  All material
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Unless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts presented are in thousands
except per share amounts.

Accounting estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  A material estimate that is
particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relates
to the determination of the allowance for doubtful notes.

Significant accounting policies:

Revenue recognition and seasonal nature of business:

The Company recognizes revenue from the sales of farm inputs such as seed,
fertilizer and agricultural chemicals upon delivery to the customers.
Customer fees consist of program fees and insurance brokerage services.
Program fees are recognized at estimated realizable amounts as the
services are performed.  Insurance brokerage revenues, also classified
as customer fees, are recognized generally on the effective date of the
policies or on the billing date, whichever is later.  During the three
years ended February 28, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the percentage of net
revenues attributable to the sale of seed, fertilizer, agricultural
chemicals, customer fees and financing income was as follows.

                       2003       2002       2001
                    ---------- ---------- ----------
Seed                     26.1%      23.0%      22.7%
Chemicals                29.2%      29.4%      28.7%

The Company decided in the current fiscal year to present revenues
associated with the cash advances for fuel, irrigation, land rents and
other farm inputs and revenues associated with the input only program
on a net reporting basis in contrast to the previously presented gross
reporting basis.  The input only program is a financing program provided
by the Company for various suppliers and manufacturers.  The Company has
decided to report its revenue in this manner because it believes it is
a preferable presentation under current generally accepted accounting
principles.  This presentation has the impact of reducing farm input
revenues and cost of farm input revenues from previously reported amounts
by approximately $268,104, $225,359 and $177,160 for the years ended
February 28, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  This change of
presentation has no impact on future or past earnings of the Company.

The income statement for the years ended February 28, 2002 and 2001
have been reclassified for this change in presentation.
Presented below is the revenue that would have been included in the
statements of income under the previous presentation.

                       2003       2002       2001
                    ---------- ---------- ----------
Farm input revenue    $430,169   $355,168   $307,892
Financing income        29,196     26,536     31,861
Customer fees            6,605      5,652      5,900
                    ---------- ---------- ----------
Total income          $465,970   $387,356   $345,653
                    ========== ========== ==========

Financing income on customer notes receivable is accrued based upon the
outstanding principal balance of the underlying note.  The accrual of
interest is discontinued on a note when management believes, after
considering collection efforts and other factors, that the customer's
financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful.
When previously accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible, such
amount is charged to the allowance for doubtful notes. No interest
income is recognized on those notes until the principal balance has
been collected.

Due to the nature of the Company's operations, the majority of revenues
are generated in the months of April through June of each fiscal year.
The Company's debt financing requirements to fund operations corresponds
with the revenue cycle.  Historically, the percentage of net revenues
recognized in each quarter has approximated the following:

     First quarter, March 1 to May 31              39%
     Second quarter, June 1 to August 31           39%
     Third quarter, September 1 to November 30     10%
     Fourth quarter, December 1 to February 28     12%

Customer notes receivable and allowance for doubtful notes:

Customer notes receivable are stated at the principal amounts outstanding
reduced by the reserve for discounts and the allowance for
doubtful notes.  The reserve for discounts is maintained at an
amount considered to be adequate based on past experience of cash
discounts granted.  The reserve is increased by provisions recorded as
a reduction of revenues and is reduced by cash discounts granted to
customers.  The allowance for doubtful notes is maintained at an amount
that management considers adequate to absorb estimated losses relating

                                  -37-
<PAGE>

to specifically identified notes, as well as probable credit losses
inherent in the balance of the note portfolio, based on an evaluation
of the collectibility of existing notes and prior loss experience.
This evaluation also takes into consideration such factors as changes
in the nature and volume of the note portfolio, overall portfolio
quality, review of specific problem notes, and current economic
conditions that may affect the customer's ability to pay.  While
management uses the best information available to make its evaluation,
future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are
significant changes in economic conditions.  The allowance is increased
by provisions charged to cost of revenues.  Notes are charged against
the allowance for doubtful notes when management believes that
collectibility of the principal is unlikely.  Subsequent recoveries
are credited to the allowance.

Customer notes receivable are considered impaired when based on current
information and events, it is probable the Company will not be able to
collect all contractual principal and interest payments due in
accordance with the terms of the agreement.  Impaired loans are measured
on an individual basis based on the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the note's effective interest rate or the fair
value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The
amount of impairment, if any, and subsequent changes are included in
the allowance for doubtful notes.

Inventories:

Inventories of agricultural inputs are valued at lower of cost
(first-in, first-out method) or market.

Foreclosed assets held for sale:

Foreclosed assets, primarily real estate, are valued at lower of cost or
fair market value minus estimated costs to sell.

Property, equipment and depreciation:

Land, which is the land donated by the City of Cedar Falls, Iowa is carried
at $875, which is the estimated fair market value of the land at the date
of the grant. The corresponding deferred revenue associated with the land
donated to the Company is included in accrued expenses and is being
amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated life of the
building placed into service in February 2002. Building, primarily the
office space constructed on the donated land is carried at cost and is
being depreciated using the straight-line method over 40 years.

Equipment, primarily transportation and office equipment, is carried at
cost and is depreciated using declining-balance methods over the estimated
useful lives ranging from three to seven years.

Deferred financing costs:

The Company incurs financing cost with lenders in connection with its
borrowing programs.  These fees are deferred and amortized using the
interest method over the life of the respective loan agreement.

                                  -38-
<PAGE>

Advertising costs:

The Company charges the costs of advertising to expense as incurred.
Advertising expense for the years ended February 28, 2003, 2002 and 2001
was $437, $663 and $1,071, respectively.

Income tax matters:

Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax
assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are
recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary differences are
the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of
changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Stock options issued to employees:

SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", establishes a fair
value based method for the accounting and financial reporting of its
stock-based employee compensation plans.  However, as allowed by the
standard, the Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value
based method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees".  Under this method, compensation
is measured as the difference between the market value of the stock on the
grant date, less the amount required to be paid for the stock.  The
difference, if any, is charged to expense over the period of service.

Had compensation cost for the Company's two stock based compensation plans
been determined based on the grant date fair values of the awards (the
method prescribed in SFAS No. 123), reported net income and earnings per
common share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts shown below:


                               2003       2002       2001

Basic earnings per share
     As reported                $1.08      $1.01      $1.41
     Pro forma                  $1.01      $0.92      $1.33

Diluted earnings per share
     As reported                $1.07      $1.00      $1.36
     Pro forma                  $1.01      $0.91      $1.28

                                  -39-
<PAGE>

The fair value of each grant is estimated at the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for grants in Fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively:
risk-free interest rates of 3.4%, 5.2%, and 4.7%; expected lives of 7 for
all years; price volatility of 39.8%, 39.5%, and 33.9% and no expected
dividends.

Fair value of financial instruments:

The carrying amount of cash, current customer notes receivable and accounts
payable approximates fair value because of the relative short maturity of
these instruments.  The carrying amount of non-current customer notes
receivable and notes payable approximate fair value because these
instruments bear interest at approximate current rates offered to credit
customers and available to the Company for similar borrowings.  The
fair value of the interest rate swap agreement discussed in Note 3 is
based on the market price provided by the commercial bank which is
counterparty to the agreement, and represents the amount the Company
would pay or receive to terminate the agreement.

Earnings per share:

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding.  In computing diluted earnings per share, the dilutive
effect of stock options during the periods presented increase the
weighted average number of shares.

Reportable operating segments:

The Company uses the "management approach" for reporting information
about segments in annual and interim financial statements.  The
management approach is based on the way the chief operating
decision-maker organizes segments within a company for making operating
decisions and assessing performance.  Reportable segments are based
on products and services, geography, legal structure, management
structure and any other manner in which management disaggregates
a company.  Based on the "management approach" model, the Company
has determined that its business is comprised of a single operating
segment.

Adoption of FAS 133:

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
(FAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
on March 1, 2001.  In accordance with the transition provisions of
FAS 133, the Company recorded a net-of-tax cumulative-effect-type
adjustment of $1,313 in accumulated other comprehensive income to
recognize at fair value all derivatives that are designated as
cash-flow hedging instruments during Fiscal 2002.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value.
The Company uses derivative instruments solely in connection with
borrowings on their term debt.  On the date the derivative contract
is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of
a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be
received or paid related to a recognized liability ("cash flow" hedge).
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective,

                                 -40-
<PAGE>

and that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge, are recorded
in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the
variability of cash flows (e.g., when periodic settlements on a
variable-rate liability are recorded in earnings).

The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective
and strategy for undertaking various hedged transactions.  This
process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as
cash-flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception
and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in
cash flows of hedged items.  When it is determined that a derivative
is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a
highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting
prospectively.

Pending Accounting Pronouncements:

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149, "Amendment of Statement
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."
This statement clarifies the definition of a derivative and incorporates
certain decisions made by the Board as part of the Derivatives Implementation
Group process.  This statement is effective for contracts entered into or
modified, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003 and
should be applied prospectively.  Adoption of this standard is not expected
to have a significant impact on the Corporation's financial condition or
results of operations.

Note 2.   Financing and Going Concern Matters

Financing Agreements

The availability of lines of credit is essential to the Company's operations.
As of May 15, 2003, the Company has arranged for financing for the 2003 crop
year of approximately $220 million, which allows for customer financing for
the 2003 crop year of up to $255 million.  This compares to total 2002 crop
year customer financing of approximately $465 million.  This credit facility
and the revolving credit facility (which financed 2002 crop loans and can
not be used to fund 2003 crop year loans) expire in June 2003 unless
certain actions are taken, including a capital investment as described below.
There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in securing
additional financing and, if financing is secured, it may be on terms less
favorable than current terms.

The Company is taking action in order to secure additional financing.
As described below, the Company has entered into a securities purchase
agreement with American Securities Capital Partners, L.P. (ASCP) whereby
ASCP has agreed to inject up to $70 million in capital in the Company,
of which $35 million would be immediately available.  The Company believes
this transaction will assist in arranging for the needed financing.
The securities purchase agreement is subject to certain conditions, including
shareholder approval.  Finalization of this transaction is not assured.

In the event that the ASCP transaction does not close and alternative
financing cannot be arranged, the Company may be left with limited
options.  Failure to obtain new financing would materially impair the
Company's ability to continue operations under the normal course of
business and could have a material adverse impact upon the Company.

Anticipated Equity Infusion

The Company entered into a securities purchase agreement during February 2003
with ASCP, a New York private-equity investment firm, under which ASCP has
agreed to invest up to $70 million in the Company in exchange for convertible
preferred stock.  The agreement contemplates that ASCP will invest up
to $70 million in three annual installments; the first payment of
$35 million is subject, among other things, to satisfactory completion
of due diligence, the Company arranging for long-term financing and
shareholder approval.  The second and third payments are conditional
upon the Company achieving certain economic thresholds.  At this time,
management does not believe it will meet these economic thresholds.
ASCP will have voting control of the Company after the initial funding.

The parties are presently conducting due diligence, negotiating final
terms and documentation.  If the transaction is consummated, current
shareholders will incur substantial dilution.  There can be no assurance
at this time that this investment will be consummated.  The Company is
considering various alternatives in the event that the transaction
is not completed.

Company Actions

In addition to the ASCP transaction, the Company has undertaken certain
actions to continue operations at a reduced level of revenue.  The
Company is anticipating that the $220 million credit facility will allow
for customer financing for the 2003 crop year of up to $255 million as
compared to 2002 crop year financing of $465 million.  Because of the
timing of these crop loans the Company will need to operate for the
2003 crop year on this lower level of activity.  Management believes

                                  -42-
<PAGE>

that this level of activity will be adequate to sustain operations
in this transition year.

The Company has also implemented a cost reduction program which will
help to mitigate the effects of the reduced financing capabilities
of the Company.  Management believes that it will be able to regain
some of the market share lost as a result of the inability to provide
financing to customers for the 2003 year.  Management also believes
that with the cost reduction program that was implemented and the
consummation of the ASCP capital investment, the Company will be
able to obtain long-term financing without suffering irrecoverable
losses due to the reduced lending capabilities.  No assurance can be
given that the Company would be successful in these efforts.

Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
on the going concern basis of accounting and do not reflect any
adjustments that might result if the Company were unable to continue
as a going concern.  As discussed above, the Company's financing
expires in June 2003 and the Company has been unable to secure
long-term financing beyond that date.  If the Company is unable to
obtain new financing, it may be unable to repay its debts in the
normal course of business and be forced to liquidate.  This raises
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The three preceding sections entitled "Financing Agreements,"
"Anticipated Equity Infusion," and "Company Actions" describe the
financing structure and the actions the Company has taken and is
planning to take to alleviate the situation.  However, there can be
no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to repay its debt
in the normal course of business and continue normal operations.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or
the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Number of customers                     183               115

The Company collected and recorded $51, $186 and $118 of interest income
on impaired (nonaccrual) notes receivable during Fiscal 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

It is the Company's policy to obtain a lien on the customer's growing
crop, along with an assignment of the customer's federal crop insurance
and government farm program payments, if available.  The Company extends
discounts to customers paying their notes timely ranging from 1% to 3%.
The notes bear interest from 8.0% to 10.5% for fixed rate notes and
from prime to 4.0% above the prime rate as listed in the Wall Street
Journal (currently 4.25% at February 28, 2003) for variable rate notes.
The variable rate notes with customers may be subject to an "interest
rate floor" which locks in a minimum interest rate for customers
ranging from 4.75% to 10.25%.

Due to the Company's customers' marketing strategies and the timing of
their receiving payment on insurance claims and government subsidies,
it is the Company's normal operating policy to carry customer notes
receivable past their due date of January 15 for north accounts and
January 31 for south accounts.  The amount of customer notes receivable
that was past due was $174,031, $140,364 and $120,779, which includes
notes on nonaccrual status of $41,196, $20,100 and $17,037 at
February 28, 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.

Changes in the allowance for doubtful notes are summarized as follows:

</TABLE>

(1) A customer note receivable is classified by the Company as "acceptable"
    if a customer account does not display any deficiencies regarding either
    the customer or the collateral.

(2) A customer note receivable is classified by the Company as "other loans
    especially mentioned (OLEM)" if a customer account is secured by adequate
    collateral which may possibly become impaired if not closely monitored by
    the Company.  In addition, certain of these accounts, while adequately
    collateralized, have required an extended period of time to receive
    payment in full.

(3) A customer note receivable is classified by the Company as "substandard"
    if a customer account displays limited deficiencies regarding either the
    customer or the collateral.  Payment in full is still considered likely
    and will require more than normal servicing and monitoring.  Some
    probability of loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount
    of substandard notes receivable, does not have to exist in individual
    notes classified as substandard.

(4) A customer note receivable is classified by the Company as "doubtful"
    if a customer account displays significant deficiencies regarding either
    the customer or the collateral.  The "doubtful" classification does not

                                  -46-
<PAGE>

    mean that the customer note receivable has no likelihood of payment.
    However, under this classification, the deficiencies may result in the
    Company receiving less than payment in full.

(5) A customer note receivable is classified by the Company as "loss" if a
    customer account is clearly not performing.  The "loss" classification
    does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery value in the
    future, but that currently there is limited liquidation value.

When determining the amount of a customer's credit limit, the Company
estimates the value of the collateral.  If there are superior liens on the
collateral, such as a landlord's lien on the crop, the Company will not
include the value of the collateral, to the extent of the amount of the
superior lien, when determining a customer's credit limit.  In the opinion
of management, superior liens are not material to the Company's operations
and do not materially affect the Company's rights because the Company
values its collateral net of any existing superior liens.

Note 4.	Pledged Assets and Related Debt

The Company negotiated a $200 million revolving line of credit for the 2003
Crop Year that expires in December 2003. The terms of the agreement allow
for two variable interest rate alternatives based on LIBOR or prime (current
effective rates range from 3.875% to 5.50% at February 28, 2003).  The
total amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit at
February 28, 2003 was $57,150.  At February 28, 2003 the Company had a
maximum amount available under the line of credit of approximately
$2.8 million based on a borrowing base computation provided by the
agreement.  This line of credit contains a provision which accelerates
the due date to June 15, 2003 in the event the Company does not receive
an equity injection from ASCP.  The Company anticipates that it will not
meet this provision and the line of credit will be extended to meet the
timing of the expected ASCP equity injection.  There can be no assurance
that the Company will get this extension.

The Company has negotiated amendments to its asset backed
securitized financing program to extend the due date to June 2003 from
November 2002.  This facility does not allow for the financing of 2003
Crop Year receivables.  This program is currently in a wind down phase,
which calls for an orderly collection of the notes receivable and pay
down of the outstanding  borrowings.  Ag Acceptance pledges its interest
in these notes receivable to a commercial paper market conduit entity
which incurs interest at variable rates in the commercial paper market
(current effective rates range from 1.27% to 1.31% at February 28, 2003)
and the remaining portion is a term note with interest at a variable
cost of LIBOR plus 50 basis points (current effective rate is 1.83% at
February 28, 2003).  The total outstanding under the asset backed
securitized financing program at February 28, 2003 and 2002 was
$52,386 and $132,501, respectively.

The Company's $75 million revolving line of credit facility was also
amended in November 2002 to extend its due date to March 31, 2003.
Subsequent to year-end, this facility was reduced to $65 million and
extended to June 2003.  This facility also does not allow for the
financing of 2003 Crop Year receivables.  Additional terms of the
agreement allow a variable interest rate based on prime (current
effective rate is 7.25% at February 28, 2003).  The total outstanding
under this facility at February 28, 2003 and 2002 was $53,450 and
$45,000, respectively.

All borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of the
Company.  The agreements as discussed above contain various restrictive
covenants, including, among others, restrictions on mergers, issuance
of stock, declaration or payment of dividends, transactions with
affiliates, loans to stockholders, and requirements that the Company
maintain certain levels of equity and pretax earnings. These restrictions
are in effect unless written consent is obtained.  Advances under the
agreements are also subject to portfolio performance, financial covenant
restrictions, and borrowing base calculations.  The Company was in
violation of one covenant at February 28, 2003, however, the note
holders have waived this violation.

In June 2002, the Company negotiated a credit facility with a financial
institution whereby the Company participates certain customer notes
receivable to this institution effective through January 2004.  Advances
and repayments under this credit agreement are based on and
collateralized by the performance of these customer notes receivable.
This agreement accrues interest based on the variable interest rates
of the underlying customer notes receivables ranging from prime to

                                  -48-
<PAGE>

2.5% over prime (current effective rates range from 4.25% to 6.75%).
At February 28, 2003 the Company had $11.6 million outstanding
under the agreement.

The Company has a credit agreement whereby the Company may borrow up
to $3.8 million, with a declining balance provision, on a revolving
line of credit through April 2022. This credit agreement was used to
finance the Company's corporate headquarters at a fixed interest
rate of 5.74% through November 2006.  At February 28, 2003 and 2002,
the Company had $2.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively,
outstanding under the credit agreement.  The agreement also contains
various restrictive financial covenants.

In February 2002, three executive officers of the Company, who are also
the original founders of the Company, loaned an aggregate of $4.4 million
to the Company.  The due date has been extended to June 2003.  The Company
makes monthly interest payments to these officers at a variable interest
rate of 0.5% below the prime rate (current effective rate is 3.75% at
February 28, 2003).  These notes are collateralized by a second mortgage
on the Company's corporate headquarters.

The Company maintains an interest-rate risk-management strategy that uses
derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings
fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility.  The Company's specific
goal is to lower (where possible) the cost of its borrowed funds.

In July 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
with an original notional amount of $30 million.  The current notional
amount of $22.5 million decreases by $7.5 million annually in each July 2003,
2004 and 2005. The swap is utilized to manage interest rate exposures and
is designated as a cash flow hedge.  The swap agreement is a variable
receive/fixed pay swap, which expires in July 2005 and has the effect of
converting the interest rate paid on the notional amount of the Company's
variable rate debt to a fixed rate of 9.78%.  The differential to be paid
or received on the swap agreement is recognized and accrued over the life
of the agreement as other comprehensive income based on the remaining
outstanding notional amount or changes in interest rates. Included in
other comprehensive income at February 28, 2003 and 2002 is a loss of
approximately $1,167 and $1,410, respectively.  The difference between
the Company's actual variable interest expense and 9.78% on the notional
amount for the next twelve months is reclassified from other comprehensive
income and recognized as interest expense.

Note 5.	Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments:

In the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments
that are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  These
include various commitments to supply farm input financing to customers.
At February 28, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company had approximately
$101,014, $152,763 and $120,446 respectively, in commitments to supply
farm input financing, including seed, chemicals, fertilizer and other
farm inputs.  No material losses or liquidity demands are anticipated
as a result of these commitments.

Contingencies:

The Company is named in lawsuits in the ordinary course of business.
Management for the Company believes, while the outcome of
various legal proceedings is not certain, it is unlikely that these
proceedings will result in any recovery which will materially affect
the financial position or operating results of the Company.

The availability of lines of credit to finance operations and the existence
of a multi-peril crop insurance program are essential to the Company's
operations.  If the federal multi-peril crop insurance program currently
in existence was terminated or negatively modified and no comparable
private or government program was established, this could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's future operations.  The government has
from time to time evaluated the federal multi-peril crop insurance program
and is likely to review the program in the future, but there can be no
assurance of the outcome of such evaluations.

Guarantee:

In the process of collecting a customer note receivable, the Company has
guaranteed the first mortgage debt of a customer to a third party financial
institution.  Under the guarantee, the Company would be required to repay
the debt of the customer under certain default conditions.  The outstanding
debt is collateralized by real estate, which could be liquidated to recover
any amounts paid by the Company under the guarantee.  The amount guaranteed
by the Company at February 28, 2003 is approximately $2,300 and expires
once the mortgage is repaid in full.

Note 7.   Employee Stock Plans and Capital Stock

Stock options plans:

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans.  On May 30, 1991 the
Company adopted its "1991 Stock Option Plan" which provides for the
issuance of a maximum of 300,000 shares of common stock to directors,
officers, employees or other persons.  Options granted under the stock
option plan may be either "incentive stock options" or "nonqualified
stock options."  As designated by the Board of Directors, the stock
option plan is administered by the officers of the Company, who designate
the type of option to be granted, the number of options to be granted,
the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each option
(subject to a specified maximum number of shares of common stock which
may be purchased under all options granted), the exercise price, the
period during which the options are exercisable, the method of payment
and certain other terms.  The exercise price for each share of common
stock covered by an option is determined by the Board of Directors or
the committee, except (i) the exercise price for an incentive stock
option may not be less than the fair market value, at the time the
option is granted, of the stock subject to the option and (ii) the
exercise price for a nonqualified stock option may not be less than
85% of the fair market value, at the time the option is granted,
of the stock subject to the option.  The exercise price for an incentive
stock option granted to any individual who owns stock, at the time of
the grant, possessing more than 10% of the voting power of the capital
stock of the Company may not be less than 110% of such fair market value
on the date of the grant.  No more than $100,000 of stock vesting
during any calendar year per person will qualify for incentive stock
option treatment.  Options are nontransferable, other than by will or
the laws of descent and distribution, and may be exercised only by the
optionee while employed by or providing services to the Company or
within three months after termination of employment by reason of
retirement or six months following termination of employment resulting
from death or permanent disability.  Options expire no later than ten
years from the date of grant, provided that incentive stock options
granted to employees owning stock possessing more than 10% of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries expire five or fewer years from the date of grant.
No additional options may be granted under this plan subsequent to
the plan's termination date of May 21, 2001.  The termination does not
effect any options outstanding on the termination date.

On August 3, 1993 the Stockholders of the Company adopted its "1993 Stock
Option Plan" which provides for the issuance of a maximum of 200,000 shares
of common stock to directors, officers, employees or other persons.  The
other provisions of the 1993 Stock Option Plan are the same as provisions
of the 1991 Stock Option Plan discussed above.  On August 1, 1995 the
stockholders of the Company approved a proposal to amend its "1993 Stock
Option Plan" to increase the maximum number shares of common stock
issuable to directors, officers, employees or other persons from 200,000
to 400,000 shares.  On August 21, 2000, the stockholders of the Company
approved a proposal to amend its "1993 Stock Option Plan" to increase
the maximum number of shares issuable from 400,000 shares to 700,000
shares. The other provisions of the 1993 Stock Option Plan remained
the same as previously discussed above.  At February 28, 2003 and 2002,
the total options available for future grant under the 1993
plan, was 246,925 and 230,675 shares, respectively.

     a)  all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
         controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to
         record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
         identified for the registrant's auditor any material weaknesses in
         internal controls; and

     b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
         employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal

     "A Loan" and, collectively, the "A Loans") to the Borrower from time
     to time on any Business Day from the Restatement Date to the
     Termination Date applicable to Facility A, during which period the
     Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow in accordance with the
     provisions hereof, provided, however, that no A Loan will be made in
     any amount which, after giving effect thereto, would cause (i) the
     Total Facility A Outstandings to exceed the Aggregate Facility A
     Commitment Amount, (ii) U.S. Bank's share of the Total Facility A
     Outstandings to exceed an amount equal to the product of (1) its
     Primary Facility A Percentage, and (2) the Aggregate Primary Facility A
     Commitment Amount less the then unused portion of the Aggregate

     A Loans in excess of its Primary Facility A Commitment Amount unless
     (A) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all A Loans made by
     each Lender (including, with respect to a Lender, only those A Loans
     made by that individual Lender) are not less than such Lender's Primary
     Facility A Commitment Amount (without giving effect to any potential
     reduction in such amount resulting from the proviso in the definition
     of Primary Facility A Commitment Amount), and (B) the Total Facility B
     Outstanding Amount is not then less than the Aggregate Facility B
     Commitment Amount.  A Loans may be obtained and maintained, at the

               "(i)  Facility A Commitment Amounts.  The Borrower may, at any
          time, upon not less than five Business Days prior written notice to
          the Agent, reduce the Facility A Commitment Amounts, ratably, with
          any such reduction in a minimum aggregate amount for all the Lenders
          of $100,000, or, if more, in an integral multiple of $100,000;
          provided, however, that (1) the Borrower may not at any time
          reduce the Aggregate Facility A Commitment Amount below the
          Total Facility A Outstandings, (2) any reductions with respect
          to the Facility A Commitment Amount shall be applied (A) first,
          to Rabobank's Secondary Facility A Commitment Amount, and (B) then,
          ratably, to each Lender's Primary Facility A Commitment Amount, and
          (3) after giving effect to the reduction priorities in (2) above,
          no Lender's share of the Total Facility A Outstandings shall exceed
          the sum of its Primary Facility A Commitment Amount and its
          Secondary Facility A Commitment Amount.  The foregoing reductions
          are independent of any reductions required by the proviso in the
          definition of Facility A Commitment Amount.  The Borrower may,
          upon not less than thirty Business Days prior written notice to

          Obligations of the Borrower hereunder in respect of A Loans.

               (ii)  Facility B Commitment Amounts.  The Borrower may, at any
          time, upon not less than five Business Days prior written notice to
          the Agent, reduce the Facility B Commitment Amounts, ratably, with
          any such reduction in a minimum aggregate amount for all the Lenders
          of $100,000, or, if more, in an integral multiple of $100,000;
          provided, however, that the Borrower may not at any time reduce
          the Aggregate Facility B Commitment Amount below the Total
          Facility B Outstandings.  The Borrower may, upon not less than
          thirty Business Days prior written notice to the Agent, terminate

                                  -5-
<PAGE>

          the Facility B Commitments in their entirety.  Upon termination of
          the Facility B Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.8, the
          Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders the
          full amount of all outstanding Advances of B Loans, all accrued
          and unpaid interest thereon, all unpaid Facility B Commitment Fees
          accrued to the date of such termination, any indemnities payable
          with respect to Advances pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16,
          and 2.17 and all other unpaid Obligations of the Borrower hereunder
          in respect of B Loans.  Notwithstanding any provision of this
          Section 2.8 or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
          Rabobank's Facility B Commitment Amount shall, on and after giving
          effect to the First Amendment, be reduced by $5,000,000 (on and
          after giving effect to such reduction, Rabobank's Facility B
          Commitment Amount will be $45,000,000).  Such reduction is
          independent of any other reduction in the Facility A Commitment
          Amounts and/or Facility B Commitment Amounts made or to be made
          under this Agreement."

     which point principal payments allocable to Facility A shall be
     applied as otherwise provided by the other terms of this Agreement
     and the Loan Documents."

          WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of Company and its shareholders

          WHEREAS, Employee is willing to serve in the employ of Company on

provided in this Agreement.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals which
are incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement, and in further
consideration of the mutual agreements, provisions and covenants contained
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

          1. Employment.  Company hereby employs Employee, and Employee hereby
             accepts employment with Company, all upon the terms and conditions
             contained in this Agreement.

          2. Services.  Employee shall devote his entire working time and
             attention to the business of Company.  Employee shall perform
             such management level duties as assigned to him from time to
             time by the senior officers of Company.  Employee shall carry
             out his duties within the policies and directions as established
             by Company and in a prudent, businesslike manner.

          3. Terms.   Company agrees to employ Employee and Employee agrees to
             remain in the employment of Company for a term commencing on the
             date hereof and continuing for a period of three (3) years.  At

          4. Compensation.   In consideration for all services rendered by

             compensate Employee as follows:

                                   -1-
<PAGE>

             a. Base Salary.  Company shall pay Employee a base salary of
                $120,000 per year, which shall be paid in accordance with
                the normal payroll practices of Company in effect from time
                to time.  Employee's base salary shall be reviewed annually
                by the senior officers of the Company during the Term and may
                be adjusted upward (but not downward) if deemed necessary or
                appropriate in the sole discretion of the senior officers.

             b. Bonus. The Company shall pay Employee a performance bonus
                based upon the diluted earnings per share ("EPS") growth of the
                Company.  The EPS growth shall be determined by comparing the
                fiscal year end audited results to the EPS of the previous year.
                Employee shall be paid a performance bonus when the Company's
                fiscal year diluted earnings per share is equal to or greater
                than 10%.  If the EPS growth rate is 10% or greater, then the
                amount of bonus is equal the to EPS growth rate multiplied by
                the Employee's prior calendar year base compensation.  When the
                EPS growth rate is 15% to 19%, then the bonus is multiplied by
                150% factor. When the EPS growth rate is 20% or greater then
                the bonus is multiplied by 200% factor.  Senior management in
                its discretion is allowed to make adjustments for events that
                negatively affect diluted EPS for the short term, but are
                considered significant to the long-term success of the Company.
                The amount of the Bonus will be determined by the annual audit
                of the Company prepared in accordance with generally accepted
                accounting principles by an independent certified public
                accountant selected by Company, and such determination will be
                binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.  The Bonus will
                be paid no later than thirty (30) days after completion of such
                audit, with deductions for payroll taxes and other items of
                withholding.

             c. Automobile.  At all times during the Term hereof, Company shall
                at its expense provide Employee with an automobile of such make
                and model as determined in accordance with Company policy as
                in effect from time to time.

             d. Other Fringe Benefits.  Employee shall be entitled to
                participate (at the expense of Company) in all now existing
                or hereafter adopted plans providing fringe benefits to the
                key executive personnel of Company and in all now existing
                or hereafter adopted plans (to the extent eligible therefore)
                providing benefits to Company's employees in general,
                including, but not limited to, group life insurance,
                supplemental life insurance and health and accident insurance.

          5. Termination of Employment by Company.

             a. Termination on Account of Disability.  Employee's employment
                under this Agreement shall terminate in the event of Employee's
                disability (as hereinafter defined) during the Term hereof.
                For purposes of this Agreement, "disability" shall be defined
                as:  (i) the permanent physical or mental disability of
                Employee continuing for a period of at least six (6) months
                which prevents Employee from performing a major portion of

                physicians in the State of Iowa, with one such physician
                selected by Company, another such physician selected by
                Employee and the third such physician selected by the two
                physicians selected by Company and Employee, and the decision
                of a majority of the three physicians shall be binding upon
                the parties; or (ii) the death of Employee.  In such event,
                Company's obligation to continue to pay Employee's compensation
                under paragraph 4 hereof shall terminate as of the end of the
                month during which a determination of "disability" in
                accordance with this paragraph has been made.  However,
                notwithstanding such termination, Company shall remain
                obligated to pay Employee (or, in the event of death, to
                Employee's spouse or, if she is not living, then to
                Employee's estate or such other person or entity as Employee
                shall designate) the following amounts:

                (1) Any base salary which is due and unpaid at the date of
                    termination, plus a pro rata Bonus amount.  The pro rata
                    Bonus amount shall be calculated by dividing number of
                    days worked in the fiscal year in which the termination
                    occurs by 365 and applying that percentage to the Bonus
                    calculation specified in paragraph 4(b) hereof.  The
                    Bonus will be paid at the time specified in paragraph
                    4(b) hereof; and

                (2) A severance benefit consisting of a monthly payment
                    equal to one-half (1/2) of the amount Employee would
                    have been entitled to receive on a monthly basis as base
                    salary pursuant to paragraph 4(a) hereof, commencing with
                    the month of termination and continuing each month
                    thereafter through and including the term of this
                    agreement.  For purposes of this paragraph 5(a), the
                    base salary used to determine the severance benefit will
                    be the base salary in effect on the date of termination.

             b. Termination for Cause.   Notwithstanding any provision in this
                Agreement which may appear to be to the contrary, Employee's
                employment under this Agreement shall terminate for "cause"
                effective immediately upon Employee's receipt of written

                                   -3-
<PAGE>

                notice from Company of such termination directed to Employee,
                and in such event, the obligation of Company to pay Employee's
                compensation under paragraph 4 of this Agreement shall
                immediately terminate.  However, notwithstanding such
                termination, Company shall remain obligated to pay Employee
                any base salary which is due and unpaid as of the date of
                termination, plus a pro rata Bonus amount.  The pro rata Bonus
                amount shall be calculated by dividing number of days worked
                in the fiscal year in which the termination occurs by 365
                and applying that percentage to the Bonus calculation specified
                in paragraph 4(b) hereof.  For purposes of this Agreement,
                "cause" shall be defined as the occurrence of any one or more
                of the following events:

                (1) A repeated neglect of duties, a violation of the Company's
                    policies, malfeasance, nonfeasance, or other conduct of
                    Employee in the performance of duties contemplated by this
                    Agreement which, in the sole discretion of the senior
                    officers of Company, is detrimental to the best interests
                    of Company;

                (2) Any other material breach by Employee, as determined in
                    the sole discretion of the senior officers of Company, of
                    the provisions of this Agreement; or

                (3) The indictment, conviction or plea of guilty or nolo
                    contendere of Employee to any felony or to a misdemeanor
                    involving moral turpitude.

             c. Termination Without Cause.   Notwithstanding any provision in
                this Agreement which may appear to the contrary, Employee's
                employment shall terminate without "cause" effective immediately
                upon Employee's receipt of written notice of such termination
                directed to Employee.  In the event Employee's employment is
                terminated by Company without "cause" (as defined above),
                Company's obligation to continue to pay Employee's
                compensation under paragraph 4 shall terminate as of the
                date of termination. Notwithstanding such termination, however,
                Company shall remain obligated to pay Employee as a severance
                benefit the following amounts:

                (1) All the base salary which Employee, but for such
                    termination, would have been entitled to receive hereunder
                    for two years from date of termination, to be paid at the
                    same time and in the same manner as provided in paragraph
                    4(a) (hereinafter referred to as the "Severance Period").

                (2) All Bonus payments which would have accrued to Employee,
                    but for such termination, during the Severance Period,
                    including a pro rata amount of the Bonus for any portion

                                    -4-
<PAGE>

                    of a fiscal year included within the Severance Period.
                    Such payment shall be determined and made by Company at
                    the same time and in the same manner as provided in
                    paragraph 4(b) hereof.

          6. Termination of Employment by Employee.

             a. Termination by Employee.   Notwithstanding any provision in
                this Agreement which may appear to be the contrary, Employee
                shall have the right to terminate his employment hereunder
                upon or after the occurrence of a Change in Control
                (as defined below) or a Diminution in Responsibility (as
                defined below) with respect to Employee and, in the event
                of such a termination by Employee, he shall be entitled to
                receive as a severance benefit from Company the following
                amounts:

                (1) All base salary which Employee, but for such termination,
                    would have been entitled to receive hereunder for the
                    Severance Period (as defined in paragraph 5 (c)(1) hereof
                    and including any adjustment thereto authorized by such
                    paragraph).  For purposes of this paragraph 6(a)(1), the
                    base salary to be paid to Employee during the Severance
                    Period will be at the rate of base salary in effect on
                    the date of termination.  Such payments shall be made by
                    Company at the same time and in the same manner as provided
                    in paragraph 4(a) hereof; and

                (2) All Bonus payments which would have accrued to Employee,
                    but for such termination, during the Severance Period,
                    including a pro rata amount of the Bonus for any portion
                    of a fiscal year included within the Severance Period.
                    Such payments shall be determined and made by Company at
                    the same time and in the same manner as provided in
                    paragraph 4(b) hereof.

             b. Change in Control.  For purposes of this paragraph 6, the term
                "Change in Control" shall be defined to mean any of the
                following events:

                (1) The acquisition and/or merger in a single transaction or
                    in any series of transactions by any person acting
                    directly or indirectly or through or in concert with
                    one or more persons (other than Company) of beneficial
                    ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
                    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of 25% or more
                    of the combined voting power of the then outstanding
                    voting securities of Company;

                                     -5-
<PAGE>

                (2) The first purchase under a tender offer or exchange offer
                    (other than an offer by Company) pursuant to which
                    outstanding voting securities of Company have been
                    purchased; or

                (3) During any period of two consecutive years, individuals
                    who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board
                    of Directors of Company cease for any reason (other than
                    an uncontested election) to constitute at least a
                    majority thereof.  For purposes of this definition, the
                    term "person" shall mean an individual or a corporation,
                    partnership, trust, association, joint venture, pool,
                    syndicate, sole proprietorship, unincorporated organization
                    or any other form of entity not listed.

             c.  Diminution in Responsibility.    For purposes of this
                 paragraph 6, the term "Diminution of Responsibility" shall
                 be defined to mean any of the following events with respect
                 to Employee:

                     his employment immediately prior to the Change of Control;
                     or

                 (2) A material change in the nature or scope of the
                     authorities, powers, functions, duties, titles or
                     responsibilities attached to Employee's position of
                     employment without Employee's written consent as a result
                     of which change Employee's position shall be or become of
                     less dignity, responsibility, importance or scope.

          7. Confidential Information and Trade Secrets.  Employee recognizes
             and acknowledges that Company has developed and continues to
             develop and use commercially valuable proprietary technical and
             non-technical information which is vital to the success of
             Company's business, and furthermore, that Company utilizes trade
             secrets in formulating, promoting, financing and selling its
             products which are entitled to protection from disclosure.
             Employee shall hold in strict confidence during the Term of this
             Agreement and at all times thereafter and shall not disclose to
             any third party any information of a confidential and proprietary
             nature not generally available to the public which becomes known
             to Employee in his course of employment with Company, or has
             become known to Employee in his course of employment with
             Company prior to the date hereof, relating to the business
             operations of Company or its customers.  If Employee fails to
             keep and perform every covenant of this paragraph 7, Company

                                  -6-
<PAGE>

             shall be entitled to specifically enforce the same by injunction
             in equity in addition to any other remedies Company may have.

          8. Noncompetition.  Employee shall not, during the Term of this
             Agreement and for two (2) years thereafter, within the trade
             area now or hereafter served by Company, associate in any
             capacity whatsoever, whether as a promoter, owner, officer,
             director, employee, partner, lessee, lender, agent, consultant,
             advisor, broker, commission salesman or otherwise, in any
             business which is in competition with the business of Company,
             except for passive investments in publicly held companies over
             which Employee does not exercise any controlling influence.
             Further, Employee shall not, for a period of two (2) years
             after the termination of his employment hereunder, in any
             manner, directly or indirectly, contact or solicit any of
             the then existing customers of Company (including but not
             limited to, any officer, director, employee, agent or affiliate
             of a customer) with respect to the business of Company or employ
             (or contact or solicit for the purpose of seeking to employ) any
             then existing employee of Company.  For purposes of this
             paragraph 8, the business of Company shall mean E-Commerce
             activities, and the marketing, distribution and/or sale of
             agricultural inputs (such as seed, chemicals and fertilizer)
             to farmers in conjunction with the extension of credit by
             Company to such farmers.  If Employee fails to keep and perform
             every covenant of this paragraph 8, Company shall be entitled
             to specifically enforce the same by injunction in equity in
             addition to any other remedies which Company may have.  If any
             portion of this paragraph 8 shall be invalid or unenforceable,
             such invalidity or unenforceability shall be in no way deemed
             or construed to affect in any way the enforceability of any
             other portion of this paragraph 8. If any court in which
             Company seeks to have the provisions of this paragraph 8
             specifically enforced determines that the scope, area or
             duration hereinafter specified is too broad, such court
             may determine a reasonable scope, area or duration.  Employee
             acknowledges that covenants contained in this paragraph 8 are
             reasonable in scope, area and duration and are necessary in
             furtherance of the legitimate interests of Company.  Employee
             represents and warrants that he has available to him sufficient
             other means of support and that observance of the covenants
             contained in this paragraph 8 will not deprive him of his
             ability to earn a livelihood or to support his dependents.


          9. Non-Waiver.  The failure of either party to insist in any one or
             more instances upon performance of any of the terms or conditions
             of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or
             relinquishment of any right granted hereunder, or of the future
             performance of any such term, covenant or condition, but the
             obligations of either party with respect thereto shall continue
             in full force and effect.

          10. Assignment.  This Agreement and all rights hereunder are personal
              to Employee and shall not be assignable by him and any purported

                                  -7-
<PAGE>

              assignment thereof shall not be valid and binding on Company.
              Company may assign this Agreement and all of its rights hereunder
              to any person, firm or corporation succeeding to the business
              of Company, provided such person, firm or corporation shall
              assume by contract or by operation of law all of Company's
              obligations hereunder.

          11. Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
              agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
              subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
              and understandings between the parties with respect to the
              subject matter hereof.

          12. Applicable Law.  This Agreement and the legal relations between
              the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in
              accordance with the laws of the State of Iowa.

          13. Notices.  All notices or other communications required or
              permitted to be given, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
              shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be duly given when
              received if delivered in person or by fax, telex, telegram
              or cable and confirmed by mail, or mailed by registered or
              certified mail (return receipt requested) or express mail,
