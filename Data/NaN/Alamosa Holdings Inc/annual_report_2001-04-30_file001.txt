each share of Alamosa PCS Holdings, Inc. was converted into one share of the new

(Delaware), Inc. (referred to herein as "Alamosa (Delaware)"), became a wholly
owned subsidiary of the new holding company, which was renamed Alamosa PCS
Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as "Alamosa PCS Holdings"). On February 14,

became the new public holding company of Alamosa PCS Holdings and its
subsidiaries pursuant to a reorganization transaction in which a wholly owned
subsidiary of Alamosa Holdings was merged with and into Alamosa PCS Holdings
(the "Reorganization"). As a result of the Reorganization, Alamosa PCS Holdings
became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alamosa Holdings, and each share of Alamosa
PCS Holdings common stock was converted into one share of Alamosa Holdings
common stock.

         References in this Proxy Statement to the "Company" refer to, and all
disclosure contained herein with respect to director and executive compensation,
board committee meetings and actions, stock price performance and other matters

company, and (iii) Alamosa (Delaware) (formerly Alamosa PCS Holdings, Inc.), for
the period prior to the Holding Company Formation, during which time it was the
public holding company.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         The Company's executive compensation philosophy reflects its belief
that the compensation of executives should:


         o    be linked to achievement of its business and strategic goals;

         o    be aligned with the interests of stockholders through awards of
              stock options and other stock-based compensation;

         o    recognize individual contributions, as well as overall business
              results; and

         o    result in attracting, motivating and retaining highly-talented
              executives to serve it.

         To achieve these objectives, the Company's current compensation program
consists of the following elements:

         o    base salary;

         o    annual incentive compensation, the receipt of which is based on:

         o    its financial performance from year to year; and/or

         o    significant individual contributions; and

         o    long-term incentive compensation, primarily in the form of stock
              options.


         CEO COMPENSATION. The structure of Mr. Sharbutt's fiscal 2000
compensation was based in part on comparisons to the compensation of executives
in similar positions with other companies in the industry, as well as Mr.
Sharbutt's level of responsibility, experience and contribution to the Company's
business objectives and the Board's ongoing assessment of the Company's
operations. In accordance with such factors, the Company entered into an
employment agreement with Mr. Sharbutt, effective October 1, 1999 (see
"Employment Agreements--David E. Sharbutt"). This agreement provides for Mr.
Sharbutt's base salary and eligible quarterly bonuses upon the achievement of
certain performance targets established by the Board of Directors. The Board
believes that the structure of Mr. Sharbutt's compensation, with its emphasis on
the Company's performance, is in the best interest of the Company's stockholders
because it more closely aligns the interests of Mr. Sharbutt and the Company's
stockholders. Mr. Sharbutt's fiscal year 2000 bonus was paid as a result of the
achievement by the Company of performance targets related to EBITDA, revenue per
user and subscriber targets.

                                       9
<PAGE>

         OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION. The Company's philosophy for the
compensation of its other executive officers focuses on each individual's level
of responsibility, experience and contribution to the Company's business
objectives and the Board's ongoing assessment of the Company's operations. The
Board of Directors places emphasis on compensation that closely aligns the
executive's interests with the stockholders' interests. Therefore, a significant
percentage of each executive officer's total compensation is tied to the
Company's performance through:


          o    bonus eligibility, based on a combination of its performance and
               individual achievement; and

          o    stock option awards.


         DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. The federal income
tax law limits the deductibility of certain compensation paid to the chief
executive officer and the four most highly compensated executives (the "covered
employees") in excess of the statutory maximum of $1 million per covered
employee. The organization and compensation committee's general policy is, where
feasible, to structure the compensation paid to the covered employees so as to
maximize the deductibility of such compensation for federal income tax purposes;
however, the committee shall retain the flexibility, where necessary to promote
the incentive and retention goals described above, to pay compensation which may
not be deductible.

                             COMPENSATION COMMITTEE:

                                   Thomas Hyde

          and Messrs. Michael V. Roberts and Steven C. Roberts entered into a
          joint venture development agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, if
          either Mr. Michael V. Roberts or Mr. Steven C. Roberts (each a
          "Project Member") undertakes an international telecommunications
          business venture (a "Project") and desires for the Company to be
          involved in that Project, then before the Project Member enters into a
          letter of intent or binding agreement of any nature with another
          person regarding the Project, written notice must be given to the
          Company and the Company has 60 days to notify the Project Member of
          its desire to participate in the Project. During such 60 day period,
          the Company has the exclusive right to elect to participate in the
          Project. Promptly after the Company gives a notice of participation,
          the Company and the Project Member shall form a project entity and
          shall execute an agreement setting forth the terms, covenants,
          conditions and provisions for the purpose, ownership, management,
          financing and operating of the Project. Unless the Project Member and
          the Company agree to a different arrangement, the Company will have a
          50% interest in each project entity and the Company will have full
          managerial control of each project entity. Except as described above,
          neither the Project Members nor the Company is obligated to bring to
          the other any opportunity to participate in a Project or any activity,
          domestic or international.

          of them with an annual compensation of $125,000, which is paid
          monthly.

     o    RIGHT OF FIRST NEGOTIATION AGREEMENT. On February 14, 2001, the
          Company and Roberts Tower entered into a right of first negotiation
          agreement which grants Roberts Tower a right to negotiate tower leases
          on a "build-to-suit" basis within the Company's present and future
          territory. During the term of the agreement, whenever the Company or
          one of its subsidiaries is required to "build to suit" communications
          towers within the present or future territories in which it operates,
          the Company must notify Roberts Tower and Roberts Tower will have the
          exclusive right for a period of 30 days to negotiate with the Company
          to provide such towers. After such 30 day period, if the Company has
          not reached an agreement with Roberts Tower, the Company may obtain
          such tower sites from other third parties. The term of this agreement
          is five years.

     o    RESALE AGREEMENT. On February 14, 2001, the Company and Messrs.
          Michael V. Roberts and Steven C. Roberts entered into a resale
          agreement which permits Messrs. Michael V. Roberts and Steven C.
          Roberts to buy air time at a discount for resale on a basis no less
          favorable than any other similar agreement to which the Company may be
          a party. Messrs. Michael V. Roberts and Steven C. Roberts may resell
          such airtime anywhere where such resales are permitted under
          applicable law. Any arrangement between the Company and Messrs.
          Michael V. Roberts and Steven C. Roberts for resales and use of air
          time will be subject to all required approvals of Sprint, Sprint
          Spectrum and Sprint PCS and/or any other applicable Sprint entities.

     o    MASTER LEASE AGREEMENT. On February 14, 2001, Roberts Wireless and
          Roberts Tower entered into a master lease agreement which provides for
          the lease from Roberts Tower by Roberts Wireless of certain buildings,
          towers, tanks and /or improvements thereon for the purpose of
          installing, operating and maintaining communications facilities and
          services thereon. The initial term of the master lease agreement
          expires in February 2006, and Roberts Wireless has the right to extend
          the initial term of the lease for four additional terms of five years
          each. The agreement provides for monthly payments aggregating to
          approximately $16,800 per year, subject to an annual adjustment of 4%
