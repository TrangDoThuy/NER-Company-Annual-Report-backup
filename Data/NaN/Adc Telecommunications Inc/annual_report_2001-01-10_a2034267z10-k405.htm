&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, the term "ADC" refers to ADC Telecommunications,&nbsp;Inc. and our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries; 1998,
1999 and 2000 refer to our fiscal years ended October&nbsp;31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively; and 2001 refers to our fiscal year ending October&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Industry Background  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid growth of the Internet and the development of advanced communications applications such as digital, video and audio programs, wireless access,
video conferencing from personal computers, video e-mail, video on demand, distance learning, telemedicine and high-speed imaging, consumers and businesses are demanding
faster, better communications services. Consumers increasingly find dial-up modem speeds unacceptable, and communications networks increasingly are required to transmit, more rapidly,
large volumes of Internet, data and video traffic to meet customers' demands with respect to sharing information, conducting business and delivering entertainment. We believe that these trends toward
"broadband" communications will continue to drive changes in the global communications industry for the foreseeable future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
consumers and businesses demand more broadband applications from providers of Internet, data, video and voice communications services, the global deregulation of communications
markets has led new service providers to enter the market. The entry of these new competitive providers into previously monopolistic or oligopolistic markets is changing the marketplace rapidly. In
the past, communications service providers have offered only a limited selection of Internet, data, video or voice services, each of which is carried on a separate network connection and is billed
separately to the customer. In contrast, new competitive communications providers increasingly are operating broadband, multiservice networks with integrated Internet, data, video and voice services
carried over a single high-speed network connection. These services are both faster and more cost-effective than the services offered in the past, and integrated providers send
just one bill for all the services the customer uses. In the deregulated market, service providers now compete for customers by attempting to offer the most attractive "bundles" of communications
services over the most cost-effective networks. As a result of this competition, there is a large potential global market for fiber optics, network equipment, software and integration
services needed to build and upgrade broadband, multiservice networks. This in turn has resulted in the recent high growth rate of sales for suppliers of communications equipment, software and
services. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several
important technological developments also have spurred growth in the communications equipment industry. We believe these developments primarily include the deployment of
all-optical networks, the creation of cost-effective computing platforms, the proliferation of more powerful software applications (including distributed applications using
Internet Protocol (IP)) and the creation of new wireless communications technologies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the past, communications networks transported information primarily through electrical systems, which transmit analog and digital information over pairs of copper wires or coaxial
cables, but at limited speeds and with limited carrying capacity. In recent years, as the capacity of optical-based transmission systems has increased, there has been a shift to optical systems, which
have several advantages over electrical systems. In optical systems, lasers transmit Internet, data, video and voice traffic through glass fibers in the form of analog- or digital-coded light pulses.
Optical systems can
transmit larger volumes of information at much higher speeds than electrical systems. Optical systems also offer higher transmission quality because the physical properties of light are insensitive to
interference from sources such as electromagnetic fields and radio frequencies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another
important change in recent years has been the development of cost-effective digital technologies, which, like optical technologies, allow greater speed and
capacity in network transmission than is possible with analog technology. In analog technology, information is converted to a voltage or </FONT></P>

current wave form for processing or transmission. In digital technology, information is converted to digital bits and then is processed or transmitted using computer-based components. The increased
use of high-speed semiconductors in communications equipment has enabled network providers to cost-effectively transmit increasing amounts of Internet, data, video and voice
communications as the bandwidth needs of their customers have grown. As a result of this development, over the past decade digital-based systems have been replacing analog-based systems in
communications networks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless
technology developments and substantial growth in wireless communications, including cellular telephone services, satellite-based services and Personal Communications
Services (PCS), also have had a dramatic impact on the communications equipment industry. In addition, wireless broadband infrastructure is being deployed for fixed wireless services in the
Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Services (MMDS) and Local Multipoint Distribution Services (LMDS) spectrum bands. Wireless communications growth has been driven by the convenience of mobility and
the higher costs of wireline infrastructures. In particular, in countries without reliable or extensive wireline systems, wireless service ultimately could provide the primary service platform for
both mobile and fixed communications applications due to the potential savings in installation time and cost. We believe that the continuing development of wireless communications technology could
extend substantially the reach of current communications networks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that all of these factors will continue to drive changes in the global communications industry for the foreseeable future. Our belief is that both consumers and businesses
desire high-speed communications connections from a single service provider that can offer a range of prices and a variety of Internet, data, video and voice services bundled into a single
package and billed on a single invoice. We believe that broadband, multiservice networks can play a key role in meeting these demands and the information needs of consumers and businesses around the
world. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Strategy  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy is to capitalize on opportunities in the global communications market created by the deployment of broadband, multiservice networks.
Communications service providers intend to serve their consumer and business customers with broadband, multiservice networks that offer faster, more cost-effective and integrated Internet,
data, video and voice services. Our broad range of products and services addresses key areas of the communications network infrastructure. Our products and services are used to design, build and
upgrade networks, connect and access networks, transport Internet, data, video and voice services over communications service networks, and provide software that generates, delivers and manages
communications services. Our many product and service offerings address the diverse needs of a customer base that includes local and long-distance telephone companies, cable television
operators, wireless service providers, Internet and data service providers, other communications service providers, broadcasters, enterprises, governments, system integrators and communications
equipment manufacturers and distributors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase Our International Market Penetration.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that significant growth for our products and services will
occur outside the United States as a result of global deregulation, substantial expansion or enhancement of communications services by many foreign countries, and the global expansion of multinational
communications service providers. Our strategy is to grow our international business by increasing our international sales and marketing resources, expanding our global manufacturing capacity,
expanding our ability to offer integration services in areas outside North America, leveraging our existing customer relationships, developing additional international distribution channels and
seeking strategic alliances and acquisitions. We are expanding our presence in international markets through manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, sales offices and systems integration
capabilities to serve our customers outside the United States. </FONT></P>

field sales offices and by independent sales representatives and distributors, as well as through U.S. public and private network providers who also distribute products outside the United States. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
maintain a customer service group that supports our field sales personnel. The customer service group is responsible for application engineering, customer training, entering orders
and supplying delivery status information. We also have a field service engineering group that provides on-site service to customers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Research and Development  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our future success depends on our ability to adapt to the rapidly changing communications environment, to maintain our significant expertise in
core technologies and to continue to meet and anticipate our customers' needs. We continually review and evaluate technological changes affecting the communications market and invest substantially in
applications-based research and development. We intend to continue an ongoing program of new product development that combines internal development efforts with acquisitions, strategic alliances and
licensing or marketing arrangements relating to new products and technologies from sources outside ADC. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
recent years, increasingly significant portions of new communications equipment purchased by public network providers and private network customers have employed optical
transmission, digital, integrated circuit, wireless and broadband copper-based technologies. In the future, we believe that these purchasing trends will include increasingly sophisticated,

services and network management systems. As a result, our internal and external product development activities are primarily directed at the following areas: </FONT></P>

integration of optical, digital and IP technologies into additional products;
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>the

incorporation of ATM and IP technologies into Internet, data, video and voice products for both public and private communications networks. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New
product development often requires long-term forecasting of market trends, the development and implementation of new processes and technologies and a substantial
capital commitment. Due to the uncertainties inherent in each of these elements, we cannot assure you that we will develop any new products on a timely basis or at all. Moreover, we cannot assure you
that any new products we develop will achieve market acceptance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Competition  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition in the communications equipment industry is intense, and we believe that our competition may increase substantially with the deployment of
broadband networks and regulatory changes. Many of our foreign and domestic competitors have more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, financial and personnel resources than we have. Rapid
technological developments within the communications industry have resulted in frequent changes among our group of competitors. Currently, our competitors primarily include: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>For
Broadband Connectivity products: Avaya, Corning, Filtronic, JDS Uniphase and Lucent Technologies.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>For
Broadband Access and Transport products: ADTRAN, Advanced Fibre Communications, Arris, Cisco Systems, Motorola, Scientific-Atlanta and Tellabs.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>For
Integrated Solutions products: Comverse Technology, Daleen Technologies, Fujitsu, Lucent Technologies, Portal Software and Ulticom. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that our success in competing with other communications product manufacturers depends primarily on our engineering, manufacturing and marketing skills; the price, quality
and reliability of our products; and our delivery and service capabilities. Although the market for our products historically has not been characterized by significant price competition, we may face
increasing pricing pressures from current and future competitors in some or all of the markets for our products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that technological change, the increasing addition of Internet, data, video and voice services to integrated broadband, multimedia networks, continuing regulatory changes
and industry consolidation or new entrants will continue to cause rapid evolution in the competitive environment of the communications equipment market. At this time it is difficult to predict the
full scope and nature of this evolution. We believe that the rapid technological changes that characterize the communications industry will continue to make the markets in which we compete attractive
to new entrants. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins and the loss of market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with existing
or new competitors or that </FONT></P>

competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Manufacturing and Suppliers  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We manufacture a wide variety of products that are fabricated, assembled and tested in our own facilities or in subcontracted facilities in the United States.
In an effort to reduce costs, we also utilize production facilities outside the United States in addition to sourcing key components and raw materials from outside the United States. The manufacturing
process for our electronic products consists primarily of assembly and testing of electronic systems built from fabricated parts, printed circuit boards and electronic components. The manufacturing
process for our electromechanical products consists primarily of fabrication of jacks, plugs and other basic components from raw materials, assembly of components and testing. Our sheet metal, plastic
molding, stamping and machining capabilities permit us to configure components to customer specifications, provide competitive lead times and control production costs. Optical components are produced
through our vertically integrated processes, including semiconductor wafer fabrication, performance and environmental testing, packaging and automated production stations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
purchase raw materials and component parts from several suppliers. These purchases consist primarily of copper wire, optical fiber, steel, brass, nickel-steel alloys, gold,
plastics, printed circuit boards, solid state components, discrete electronic components and similar items. Although many of these items are single-sourced, we have experienced no significant
difficulties to date in obtaining
adequate quantities. These circumstances could change, however, and we cannot be sure that sufficient quantities or quality of raw materials and component parts will be as readily available in the
future or, even if they are available, will be able to be obtained at favorable prices. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Proprietary Rights  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We own a number of U.S. and foreign patents relating to our products. These patents, in the aggregate, constitute a valuable asset. However, we believe that
our business is not dependent upon any single patent or any particular group of related patents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have registered the initials "ADC" alone and in conjunction with specific designs as trademarks in the United States and various foreign countries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Employees  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of October&nbsp;31, 2000, we employed approximately 22,450 people. We consider relations with our employees to be good. </FONT></P>

factors set forth on Exhibit&nbsp;99-a to this Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Item 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;PROPERTIES  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our corporate headquarters are currently located in Minnetonka, Minnesota. We intend to move our corporate headquarters to a new facility in Eden Prairie,
Minnesota, in 2001. We have entered into an operating lease agreement for the new corporate headquarters facility that is presently under construction. The facility is planned in two phases. The total
cost of both phases currently is estimated at approximately $136 million. Construction of the first phase of the Eden Prairie facility began late in 1999 and is expected to be completed in the summer
of 2001. The initial phase of the facility will comprise approximately 530,000 square feet. The planned second phase would expand the facility to between 1.0&nbsp;million and 1.2&nbsp;million
square feet. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
own or lease manufacturing or distribution facilities in several countries around the world including the United States, Argentina, Australia, Austria, China, Finland, Israel,
Mexico, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These various facilities comprise approximately 6.04&nbsp;million square feet in the aggregate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also own and lease a variety of other facilities for our manufacturing, development, distribution, warehousing, sales and other activities. These facilities, including sales

Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Venezuela. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that the facilities used in our operations and currently under development are suitable for their respective uses and adequate to meet our current needs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Item 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is
expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2000, we made payments of approximately $400,000 for personnel assessment and development services to MDA Consulting Group,&nbsp;Inc., a company in
which the spouse of Lynn Davis, one of our executive officers, is a majority owner. We believe that the amount of payments made in relation to the services provided were consistent with market rates. </FONT></P>
