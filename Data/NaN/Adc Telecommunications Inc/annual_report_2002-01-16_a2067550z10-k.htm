<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Industry Background  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that broadband, multiservice communications networks represent a key enabling capability for meeting the information needs of businesses and consumers
around the world. The rapid growth of the Internet has driven the need for broadband network infrastructure. We believe consumers
increasingly find dial-up modem speeds unacceptable for current Internet and Web-based applications. Further, we believe that new or future applications such as digital video
and audio programs, wireless Internet access, video conferencing from personal computers, video e-mail, video on demand, distance learning, telemedicine and high-speed imaging
will drive even more people to use broadband communications services. We believe that the global deregulation of communications markets is transforming traditional communications service providers
into integrated communications providers. Traditional communications service providers offer only a limited selection of Internet, data, video or voice services, each on a separate network connection
and a separate customer bill. Integrated communications providers operate broadband, multiservice networks that offer faster, more cost-effective and integrated Internet, data, video and
voice services over a single high-speed network connection while sending only one bill for all of the services the customer uses. Due to deregulation, communications service providers now
compete for customers by offering bundles of different communications services over cost-effective networks. As a result of competition among communications service providers to obtain and
retain customers with bundled services, we believe there is a large potential global market for fiber optics, broadband access and network equipment, software and systems integration services to build
and upgrade broadband, multiservice networks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Marketplace Conditions  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operating results during fiscal 2001 were affected adversely by the downturn in general economic conditions, particularly in the communications equipment
industry. In this economic environment, many of our communications service provider customers have deferred capital spending, reduced their telecommunications equipment purchases, and announced plans
to further reduce capital expenditures in fiscal 2002. The effect of these developments has been most pronounced in the U.S. market. As a result of these economic conditions, we expect that our future
net sales will not grow at rates experienced prior to fiscal 2001. If the current economic conditions in the United States do not improve, or if the global economic slowdown worsens, we may continue
to experience adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
ability to grow our business is dependent on our ability to develop and commercially introduce new products successfully and on the growth of the communications equipment and
services market. The communications equipment industry is highly competitive, and we cannot guarantee that our new or enhanced products and services will meet with market acceptance or be profitable.
Growth in the market for broadband communications products and services depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital to communications service providers, the amount of capital
expenditures by communications service providers, new and revised regulatory and legal requirements, and end-user demands for Internet, data, video, voice and other communications
services. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to many factors, including but not limited to uneven or changing capital spending by our customers and the
timing of significant capital expenditures, and results of operations described in this Form&nbsp;10-K may not be indicative of results to be achieved in future periods. As a result of our growth in
past periods, our expenses had increased substantially as we entered fiscal 2001. Throughout fiscal 2001, we implemented a cost restructuring plan through which we took steps to reduce operating
expenses and capital spending as it became evident our industry was entering a prolonged economic downturn. Our </FONT></P>

cost-saving actions included the sale of non-strategic product lines, the disposition of certain assets and a consolidation of facilities as well as reductions in our employee
base, elimination of contractor positions and unreplaced attrition, which reduced our workforce by approximately 46.4%. Despite these actions, if we are unable to meet expected revenue levels in any
particular quarter, there may be a material adverse impact on our operating results for that period because we may not be able to further reduce our expenses rapidly enough to compensate for reduced
revenue levels. Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenues. Although management has and will continue to take measures to adjust expense levels, if revenue levels in a
particular period fluctuate, operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we expect that gross margins may decline due to lower sales volumes, potentially heightened price competition,
increasing levels of service revenues as a percentage of total revenues, higher inventory obsolescence and reserve charges, ongoing introduction of new products for new high-growth
markets, and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold. Additional reductions in gross margins may occur if product or related warranty costs are greater than we have
experienced in the past. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
part of our restructuring initiative in fiscal 2001, we sold non-strategic product lines in cable/broadcast TV transmission, broadband wireless transmission, enterprise
access products, wireless components, phase masks and enhanced services software, and closed down our Cellworx&reg; transport product line. These products accounted for approximately
$368.8&nbsp;million in net sales in fiscal 2001 but did not meet our growth, profitability and market leadership criteria. As a result of these sales and closures, we recorded
non-recurring restructuring charges in fiscal 2001. These charges reflect management's estimate of the overall impact of decisions and actions taken with respect to these product lines.
Actual final restructuring charges may differ from management's estimates and may result in additional charges or credits to our future operating results. </FONT></P>

results of operations normally are subject to seasonal factors. We historically have experienced a stronger demand for our products during the fourth fiscal quarter ending
October&nbsp;31, primarily as a result of customer budget cycles and our fiscal year-end incentives, and have experienced a weaker demand for our products during the first fiscal quarter
ending January&nbsp;31, primarily as a result of the number of holidays in late November, December and early January and a general industry slowdown during that period. There can be no assurance
that these historical seasonal trends will continue in the future. For instance, due to the economic downturn in the communications equipment and services market during fiscal 2001, this historical
trend was not evident in fiscal 2001. A more detailed description of the risks to our business related to seasonality, along with other risk factors associated with our business, can be found in
Exhibit&nbsp;99-a to this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
used in this report, fiscal 1999, fiscal 2000, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 refer to our fiscal years ended October&nbsp;31, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Strategy  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy is to capitalize on opportunities in the global communications market created by the deployment of broadband, multiservice networks. Communications
service providers intend to serve their consumer and business customers with broadband, multiservice networks that offer faster, more cost-effective and integrated Internet, data, video
and voice services. Our broad range of products and services address key areas of the communications network infrastructure. Our products and services are used to design, build and upgrade networks,
connect and access networks, transport Internet, data, video and voice services over communications service networks, and provide operations support system (OSS) software to operate communications
networks. Our many product and service offerings address the diverse needs of a customer base that includes local and long-distance telephone companies, cable television operators,
wireless service providers, Internet and data service providers, other communications service providers, broadcasters, enterprises, governments, system integrators and communications equipment
manufacturers and distributors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
fiscal 2001, we restructured our business. This restructuring was precipitated largely by the general downturn in economic conditions in the communications equipment industry. The
goal of our restructuring has been to position us for profitable growth in the most critical market segments for the profitable deployment of broadband networks and services. In connection with this
restructuring, we undertook several steps to streamline our operations and more acutely focus our business on strategic products and global customer satisfaction. We completed an extensive review of
our existing product and service offerings. Through this review we identified four key future growth areas: optics, IP cable, DSL and software. We also renewed our commitment to two of our historic
core businesses: broadband connectivity systems and systems integration services. We then either divested or closed product and service offerings that were not included within the four key future
growth areas or the two historic core businesses. In addition to streamlining our operations to focus on strategic products, we also have reorganized our sales, marketing and customer service
organizations to serve our customers more effectively with custom-tailored solutions spanning the breadth of our products and services, in contrast to our historical approach of presenting only a
narrow set of products or services. We also will provide members of our sales and customer service organizations with primary responsibility for specific customers for all of our product and services
offerings. Our intent through this reorganization is to help our customers be successful by understanding and being responsive to their needs, and working collaboratively with them to provide
cost-competitive, scalable and custom-tailored solutions that create competitive advantages in broadband communications. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that our success in competing with other communications product manufacturers depends primarily on the following factors: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>our
engineering, manufacturing and marketing skills;
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>the
price, quality and reliability of our products; and
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>our
delivery and service capabilities. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Although
the market for our products historically has not been characterized by significant price competition, we may face increasing pricing pressures from current and future competitors in some or
all of the markets for our products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that technological change, the increasing addition of Internet, data, video and voice services to integrated broadband, multimedia networks, continuing regulatory changes and
industry consolidation or new entrants will continue to cause rapid evolution in the competitive environment of the communications equipment market. At this time it is difficult to predict the full
scope and nature of this evolution. So long as capital is accessible, we believe that the rapid technological changes that characterize the communications equipment industry will continue to make the
markets in which we compete attractive to new entrants. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins and the loss of market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able
to compete successfully with existing or new competitors or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Manufacturing and Suppliers  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We manufacture a wide variety of products that are fabricated, assembled and tested in our own facilities or in subcontracted facilities in the United States. In
an effort to reduce costs and improve customer service, we also utilize production facilities outside the United States in addition to sourcing key components and raw materials outside the United
States. The manufacturing process for our electronic products consists primarily of assembly and testing of electronic systems built from fabricated parts, printed circuit boards and electronic
components. The manufacturing process for our connectivity products is completely vertically integrated and consists primarily of fabrication of jacks, plugs and
other basic components from raw materials, assembly of components and testing. Our sheet metal, plastic molding, stamping and machining capabilities permit us to configure components to customer
specifications, provide competitive lead times and control production costs. Optical components also are produced through our vertically integrated processes, including semiconductor wafer
fabrication, performance and environmental testing, packaging and automated production stations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
purchase raw materials and component parts from several suppliers. These purchases consist primarily of copper wire, optical fiber, steel, brass, nickel-steel alloys, gold, plastics,
printed circuit boards, solid state components, discrete electronic components and similar items. Although many of these items are single-sourced, we have experienced no significant difficulties to
date in obtaining adequate quantities. These circumstances could change, however, and we cannot guarantee that sufficient quantities or quality of raw materials and component parts will be as readily
available in the future or, if available, that we will be able to obtain them at favorable prices. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Proprietary Rights  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We own a number of U.S. and foreign patents relating to our products. These patents, in the aggregate, constitute a valuable asset. We do not believe, however,
that our business is dependent upon any single patent or any particular group of related patents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have registered the initials "ADC" alone and in conjunction with specific designs as trademarks in the United States and various foreign countries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of October&nbsp;31, 2001, we employed approximately 12,000 people. During the restructuring of our business in fiscal 2001, we reduced our number of
employees by approximately 11,500 through involuntary workforce reductions, unreplaced attrition and the elimination of contractor positions. Reductions due to the divestiture of business units were
offset effectively by the number of employees we gained through our acquisitions of CommTech Corporation and France Electronique S.A.'s telecom systems integration business, which were completed in
fiscal 2001. We consider relations with our employees to be good. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our corporate headquarters are located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. We lease our corporate headquarters facility pursuant to an operating lease agreement with a
term expiring in 2004. Our corporate headquarters comprise approximately 500,000 square feet. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
own or lease manufacturing, distribution and office facilities in several countries around the world, including the United States, Australia, Brazil, China, Israel, Mexico, Sweden and
the United Kingdom. We also own and lease a variety of other facilities for our manufacturing, development, distribution, warehousing, sales and other activities. These facilities, which include sales
offices, are located in various countries, including the United States, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Venezuela. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that the facilities used in our operations and currently in development are suitable for their respective uses and adequate to meet our current needs. During fiscal 2001 we
took steps to reduce and consolidate our facilities in response to the downturn in general economic conditions, particularly in the communications equipment industry. In April&nbsp;2001, we had
active space and irrevocable commitments to activate space totaling approximately 8.3&nbsp;million square feet. Through the sale or subleasing of facilities, the placement of sites on inactive
status or the disposition of facilities through the divestiture of business units, we presently maintain approximately 4.8&nbsp;million square feet of active space. </FONT></P>
