<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC's
customers include local and long-distance telephone companies, cable television operators, wireless service providers, new competitive service providers,
broadcasters, enterprises, governments, system integrators and communications equipment manufacturers and distributors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
used in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "ADC" refers to ADC Telecommunications,&nbsp;Inc. and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries;
1997, 1998 and 1999 refer to the ADC's fiscal years ended October&nbsp;31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively; and 2000 refers to ADC's fiscal year ending October&nbsp;31, 2000.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Industry Background</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the global deregulation of communications markets, thousands of new competitive service providers have entered the market to compete with the
incumbent service providers of Internet/data, video and voice communications. These new service providers are rapidly changing the marketplace by offering new choices and bundles of communications
services never before offered to consumers and businesses. The dynamics of the deregulated communications market has resulted in the recent high growth rate of sales for suppliers of communications
equipment, software and services. The factors driving this growth consist primarily of the following: increased demand from consumers and businesses for high-speed, integrated services
such as Internet access, digital video and broadband wireless access; rapid growth of Internet services; continuous technological development of fiber-optics, integrated circuits and software to
increase broadband capacities and applications; and the convergence of Internet/data, video, and voice network traffic onto broadband, multiservice networks. ADC believes that these trends will
continue to drive changes in the global communications industry for the foreseeable future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased
demand for higher-speed, higher-capacity services such as Internet access, digital video and broadband wireless access has in turn resulted in substantial demands to build
and upgrade the communications network infrastructure. Communications networks are increasingly required to transmit large volumes of data and video for the purpose of communicating information,
conducting business and delivering entertainment. In addition, both consumers and businesses are requesting high-speed connections from a single broadband, multiservice provider offering a
range of prices for various bundles of integrated Internet/data, video and voice services. Specifically, the industry term "broadband" refers to all transmission speeds of T1 (1.544&nbsp;million
bits per second) and higher. Growth in broadband applications has resulted in increased infrastructure investment by communications service providers in order to expand network capacity and provide
new applications and services to meet users' needs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several
important technological developments have spurred growth in the communications equipment industry. One important technological change has been the deployment of fiber-optic
transmission systems. In a fiber-optic system, lasers transmit Internet/data, video and voice traffic in the form of analog or digital coded light pulses through glass fibers. The increasing shift to
fiber-optic transmission systems has been principally due to the ability of fiber optics to carry large volumes of information at high speeds, its insensitivity to electromagnetic interference and the
high transmission quality made possible by the physical properties of light. As technologies such as Synchronous Optical NETwork
(SONET), Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and 1550 nanometer laser transmission technologies have evolved over the last several years, the capacity of fiber-optic systems to transport
information has increased significantly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
development of cost-effective digital technology has also allowed greater capacity (or speed) in network transmission and has resulted in an increasing trend over the
past decade to replace analog technology in copper, fiber and wireless transmission networks. In analog technology, information is converted to a voltage or current wave form for processing or
transmission. In digital technology, information is converted to digital bits and then processed or transmitted using computer-based
<!-- ZEQ.=2,SEQ=3,EFW="9930982",CP="ADC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=3,FILE='DISK039:[99STP0.99STP3280]CA3280A.;13',USER='JKEENE',CD='30-DEC-1999;16:21' -->
components. High-speed digital technology developments such as SONET, cell-based Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
modulation technologies have enabled network providers to transmit increasing amounts of data and video communications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless
technology developments have also had an impact on the communications equipment industry. There has been substantial growth in wireless communications such as cellular
telephone services and satellite-based services, as well as Personal Communications Services (PCS) communications, Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Services (MMDS) and Local Multipoint
Distribution Services (LMDS) for wireless cable services and wireless data and paging services. This growth has been driven by the convenience of mobility and the limits of wireline infrastructure. In
particular, in countries without reliable or extensive wireline systems, wireless service could ultimately provide the primary service platform for both mobile and fixed communications applications
due to the potential savings in installation time and cost. ADC believes that in future years the continuing development of wireless communications technology could substantially extend the reach of
current communications networks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
believes that broadband, multiservice networks represent a key enabling capability for meeting the information needs of consumers and businesses around the world. The rapid growth
of Internet/ data and digital video traffic has driven the need for broadband infrastructure. Additional bandwidth is required as the result of a wide range of new applications, including video and
audio programs on the Internet, wireless Internet access, personal video conferencing from a personal computer, video e-mail, video on demand, electronic commerce, distance learning,
telecommuting, telemedicine and high-speed imaging such as remote medical imaging. ADC believes that the global deregulation of communications markets is transforming traditional
communications service providers into integrated communications providers. Traditional communications service providers offer only a limited selection of Internet/data, video or voice
services&#151;each on a separate network connection and a separate customer bill. Integrated communications providers operate broadband, multiservice networks that offer faster,
cost-effective and integrated Internet/data, video and voice services over a single high-speed network connection and send one bill for all the services the customer uses. As a
result of deregulation, each service provider now competes for customers by offering the best-value bundle of communications services over the most cost-effective network. As a
result of competition among communications service providers to win and retain customers with bundled services, there is a large and growing global market for network equipment, software and
integration services to build and upgrade broadband, multiservice networks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Strategy</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC's strategy is to capitalize on opportunities in the global communications market by providing the network equipment, software and integration services to
enable communications service providers to service their residential and business customers with broadband, multiservice networks offering faster, cost-effective and integrated
Internet/data, video and voice services. ADC's broad range of products and services address key areas of the communications network infrastructure, and are used to design, build
and upgrade networks, provide equipment to connect and access networks and transport communications services, and provide software to generate, deliver and manage communications services. ADC's many
product and service offerings address the diverse needs of its customers, including local and long-distance telephone companies, cable television operators, wireless service providers, new
competitive service providers, broadcasters, enterprises, governments, system integrators and communications equipment manufacturers and distributors.

<DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><I>Focus on Broadband, Multiservice Opportunities.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;Global deregulation, rapid growth of the
Internet, and increasing consumer and business demands for broadband communications has created significant global opportunities to build and upgrade broadband, multiservice networks. Telephone
companies, cable television operators, Internet/data service providers, wireless service providers and other communications service providers are building the broadband infrastructure required to
offer high-speed Internet access, data, video, telephony and other interactive multimedia services to residential and business customers. As broader network bandwidths are continually
required for these services, ADC believes that building and upgrading of broadband, multiservice networks presents one of the greatest market growth opportunities in the communications industry today.
ADC is focusing its development and marketing resources on network equipment, software and integration services that will enable communications service providers worldwide to serve their residential
and businesses customers with broadband, multiservice networks offering faster, cost effective and integrated Internet/data, video and voice services.

products and services will occur outside the United States as a result of deregulation and the need of many foreign countries to substantially expand or enhance their communications services. ADC's
strategy is to grow its international penetration by increasing its international sales and marketing resources, expanding global manufacturing capacity, leveraging its existing customer
relationships, developing additional international distribution channels and seeking strategic alliances and acquisitions. ADC is expanding its presence in international markets with manufacturing
facilities, distribution centers and sales offices to serve its customers outside the United States.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><I>Supplement Internal Development Efforts with Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;Because
of the dynamic nature of the communications equipment industry, ADC has sought and intends to continue to seek acquisitions and alliances that will: (i)&nbsp;add key technologies that ADC can
leverage across its businesses, (ii)&nbsp;broaden its product offerings, (iii)&nbsp;permit ADC to enter attractive new markets and (iv)&nbsp;expand or enhance its distribution channels. To
accomplish these objectives, during 1999, ADC completed the following acquisitions: (a)&nbsp;Teledata Communications,&nbsp;Ltd., a supplier of advanced wireline and wireless customer access
network equipment for telephone operating companies; (b)&nbsp;Hadax Electronics,&nbsp;Inc., a company with remote network test and access products and technology; (c)&nbsp;Phasor Electronics, an
Austrian-based manufacturer of radio frequency amplifiers; (d)&nbsp;Pathway,&nbsp;Inc., a manufacturer of the AccessPoint&#153; access system, which interfaces with several existing ADC
products and includes an ATM
access product that transports Internet/data, video and voice communications over high-speed, switched broadband networks; (e)&nbsp;Spectracom&nbsp;Inc., a developer of
high-powered pump laser chips and modules for use in fiber-optic networks, and (f)&nbsp;Saville Systems PLC, a provider of convergent billing and customer care solutions for local, data,
long distance, wireless, cable television and energy communications markets.

copper-based and fiber-optic-based products by delivering high-speed wireless Internet/data, video and voice services to customers. With major carriers Worldcom and Sprint entering the
wireless market in 1999, ADC believes that wireless products offer a viable alternative to wireline solutions for access to the "last mile/kilometer" of the communications network. In 1999, ADC
released and began selling its Cellspan system. Although further refinement and testing of the Cellspan system will be required prior to large-scale deployment, ADC believes that the experience it
gained from selling one-way Multi-point Microwave Distribution Systems (MMDS) in this market for the past four years will enable ADC to compete successfully in the wireless market.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless Cable and Broadcast TV Transmission Equipment.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC supplies products to the wireless cable and broadcast TV
market. ADC designs and manufactures television transmission products for these markets, including transmitters, combiners, back-up equipment and antennas to wireless cable operators for
MMDS. Because the Federal Communications Commission has mandated that each TV station establish a digital channel by the end of the year 2003 or lose their license to the existing analog TV market,
each TV station must establish a separate digital TV channel and install an additional TV transmitter for broadcasting. ADC believes that its existing TV transmitters and other system capabilities
will enable ADC to leverage other products into other Broadband Access and Transport applications in the wireless cable and broadcast TV industries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC sells its products to customers in three primary markets: (i)&nbsp;the United States public communications network market, which includes all five of the
RBOCs, other telephone companies, long distance carriers, wireless service providers, cable TV operators and other domestic public network providers; (ii)&nbsp;the private and governmental voice,
Internet/data and video network markets in the United States, which includes large business customers and governmental agencies that own and operate their own voice, data and video networks for
internal use; and (iii)&nbsp;the international public and private network market. The U.S. public, U.S. private and governmental and international market segments accounted for 74.6%, 2.4% and
23.0%, respectively, of ADC's net sales for the year ended October&nbsp;31, 1999; 73.3%, 5.1% and 21.6%, respectively, of ADC's net sales for the year ended October&nbsp;31, 1998; and 73.2%, 5.5%
and 21.3%, respectively, of ADC's net sales for the year ended October&nbsp;31, 1997. ADC also sells product for each of these customer groups to communications OEMs.&nbsp;Additional financial
information concerning sales of ADC's products is contained in ADC's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended October&nbsp;31, 1999 (the "Annual Report"). Portions of the Annual
Report are contained in Exhibit 13-a to this Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC" or the "Commission"), and are incorporated herein by reference.

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Research and Development</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC believes that its future success depends on its ability to adapt to the rapidly changing communications environment, to maintain its significant expertise
in core technologies and to continue to meet and anticipate its customers' needs. ADC continually reviews and evaluates technological changes affecting the communications market and invests
substantially in applications-based research and development. ADC intends to continue an ongoing program of new product development that combines internal development efforts with acquisitions, joint
ventures and licensing or marketing arrangements relating to new products and technologies from sources outside ADC.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
recent years, increasingly significant portions of new communications equipment purchased by public network providers and private network customers have employed fiber-optic
transmission, digital, integrated circuit, wireless and broadband copper-based technologies for residential, business and wireless broadband local loop applications. In the future, these
communications network equipment purchasing trends will include increasingly sophisticated, software-intensive, OSS and network management systems. As a result, ADC's internal and external product
development activities are primarily directed at the following areas: (i)&nbsp;the integration of fiber optic technology into additional products; (ii)&nbsp;the continuing development of its
Homeworx system for telephony, data and integrated video, telephony and Internet/data applications; (iii)&nbsp;the development of network systems (including billing and customer care) software;
(iv)&nbsp;the continuing development of its Soneplex and Cellworx systems for integrated Internet/data, video and voice applications; (v)&nbsp;the continuing development of wireless products;
(vi)&nbsp;the incorporation of ATM and internet protocol technologies into Internet/data, video and voice products for both public and private communications networks; and (vii)&nbsp;the addition
of video compression technology to its product line.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New
product development often requires long-term forecasting of market trends, development and implementation of new processes and technologies and a substantial capital
commitment. As a result of these and other factors, development and customer acceptance of new products is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed on a
timely basis or achieve market acceptance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Competition</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition in the communications equipment industry is intense, and ADC believes that competition may increase substantially with the deployment of broadband
networks and regulatory changes. Many of ADC's foreign and domestic competitors have more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, financial and personnel resources than those of ADC. ADC's
Broadband Connectivity products are competitive with products offered by several other companies, including
<!-- ZEQ.=1,SEQ=13,EFW="9930982",CP="ADC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=12,FILE='DISK039:[99STP0.99STP3280]CC3280A.;12',USER='JKEENE',CD='30-DEC-1999;16:22' -->
Lucent Technologies, Siecor and Telect. ADC's principal competitors in the Broadband Access and Transport market include Pairgain Technologies, Adtran, 3COM, General Instrument, Scientific-Atlanta and
ANTEC. In the systems integration services and product market, ADC competes with Lucent Technologies, Nortel and Andersen Consulting. In the customer care and billing software market, ADC's primary
competitors are Kenan Systems, a subsidiary of Lucent Technologies, and Daleen Technologies. In addition, ADC faces increasing competition from a number of other smaller competitors, none of which is
dominant at this time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
rapid technological developments within the communications industry have resulted in frequent changes to ADC's group of competitors. ADC believes its success in competing with
other manufacturers of communications products depends primarily on its engineering, manufacturing and marketing skills, the price, quality and reliability of its products and its delivery and service
capabilities. While the market for ADC's products has not historically been characterized by significant price competition, ADC may face increasing pricing pressures from current and future
competitors in certain or all of the markets for its products.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
believes that technological change, the increasing addition of Internet/data, video, voice and other services to integrated multimedia networks, continuing regulatory changes and
industry consolidation or new entrants will continue to cause rapid evolution in the competitive environment of the communications equipment market, the full scope and nature of which are difficult to
predict at this time. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins and the loss of market share by ADC. ADC believes that industry regulatory change may create new
opportunities for suppliers of communications equipment. ADC expects, however, that such opportunities may attract increased competition from others as well. In addition, ADC expects that Lucent
Technologies will continue to be a major supplier to the RBOCs and will compete more extensively outside the RBOC market. ADC also believes that the rapid technological changes which characterize the
communications industry will continue to make the markets in which ADC competes attractive to new entrants. There can be no assurance that ADC will be able to compete successfully with its existing or
new competitors or that competitive pressures faced by ADC will not materially and adversely affect its business, operating results or financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Manufacturing and Supplies</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC manufactures a wide variety of products which are fabricated, assembled and tested in its own facilities or in subcontracted facilities. In an effort to
reduce costs, ADC also utilizes off-shore assembly and sourcing. The manufacturing process for ADC's electronic products consists primarily of assembly and testing of electronic systems
built from fabricated parts, printed circuit boards and electronic components. The manufacturing process for ADC's electromechanical products consists primarily of fabrication of jacks, plugs, and
other basic components from raw materials, assembly of components and testing. ADC's sheet metal, plastic molding, stamping and machining capabilities permit ADC to configure components to customer
specifications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
purchases raw materials and component parts, consisting primarily of copper wire, optical fiber, steel, brass, nickel-steel alloys, gold, plastics, printed circuit boards, solid
state components, discrete electronic components and similar items, from several suppliers. Although a few of the components used by ADC are single-sourced, ADC has experienced no significant
difficulties to date in obtaining adequate quantities of these raw materials and component parts. This circumstance could change in the future, however, and ADC cannot be sure that the quantity or
quality of raw materials and component parts will be as readily available in the future.
