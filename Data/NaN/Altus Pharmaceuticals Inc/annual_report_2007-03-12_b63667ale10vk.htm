    We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development
    and commercialization of oral and injectable protein
    therapeutics for gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders, with
    two product candidates advancing toward late stage clinical
    development. We use our proprietary protein crystallization
    technology to develop protein therapies which we believe will
    have significant advantages over existing products and will
    address unmet medical needs. Our product candidates are designed
    to degrade toxic metabolites in the gut or increase the amount
    of a protein that is in short supply in the body. We have
    successfully completed a Phase&#160;II clinical trial of
    ALTU-135 for the treatment of malabsorption due to exocrine
    pancreatic insufficiency and we have also successfully completed
    a Phase&#160;II clinical trial of ALTU-238 in adults for the
    treatment of growth hormone deficiency. We are developing
    ALTU-238 under an agreement with Genentech, Inc., or Genentech,
    relating to the development, manufacture and commercialization
    of this product candidate in North America. We have a pipeline
    of other product candidates in preclinical research and
    development. Our most advanced preclinical product candidate is
    ALTU-237, which is designed to treat hyperoxalurias, a series of
    conditions in which too much oxalate is present in the body,
    resulting in an increased risk of developing kidney stones and,
    in rare instances, crystal formations in other organs.

    Our lead product candidate, ALTU-135, is an orally-administered
    enzyme replacement therapy consisting of three digestive
    enzymes, lipase, protease and amylase, for the treatment of
    malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Exocrine
    pancreatic insufficiency is a deficiency of digestive enzymes
    normally produced by the pancreas which leads to malabsorption
    of nutrients, malnutrition, impaired growth and shortened life
    expectancy. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can result from a
    number of diseases and conditions, including cystic fibrosis,
    chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. According to IMS
    Health, global prescription sales of existing pancreatic enzyme
    replacement products were approximately $739&#160;million in
    2006.

    notice that manufacturers of existing pancreatic enzyme
    replacement products will be subject to regulatory action if
    they do not obtain approved NDAs for those products by
    April&#160;28, 2008. We believe that some of the manufacturers

    In 2005, we completed a prospective, randomized, double-blind,
    dose-ranging Phase&#160;II clinical trial of the capsule form of
    ALTU-135. The results of this trial demonstrated that ALTU-135
    was well tolerated and in the two higher dose treatment arms
    ALTU-135 showed a statistically significant improvement in fat
    absorption
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">(p-value&#60;0.001),</FONT>
    the trial&#146;s primary endpoint, as well as a statistically
    significant improvement in protein absorption
    (p-value&#60;0.001) and a statistically significant decrease in
    stool weight (p-value&#60;0.001), each of which was a secondary
    endpoint in the study. In addition, we observed a positive
    trend, although not statistically significant, in carbohydrate
    absorption. However, the results of our Phase&#160;II clinical
    trial may not be predictive of the results in our planned
    Phase&#160;III clinical trial of ALTU-135. We expect to initiate
    a pivotal Phase&#160;III clinical efficacy trial of the capsule
    form of ALTU-135 in patients with cystic fibrosis in the second
    quarter of 2007 and a long-term safety study in cystic fibrosis
    patients and chronic pancreatitis patients with pancreatic
    insufficiency in the second quarter of 2007. The FDA and the
    European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, have granted ALTU-135 orphan
    drug designation, which generally provides a drug being
    developed for a rare disease or condition with marketing
    exclusivity for seven years in the United States and ten years
    in the European Union if it is the first drug of its type
    approved for such indication. In December 2006, the FDA informed
    us of its intention to revoke our orphan drug designation
    because it found the prevalence of pancreatic insufficiency
    exceeded the statutory 200,000&#160;patient limit if all
    HIV/AIDS patients who suffer from fat malabsorption were
    included in the patient population. We responded to the FDA that
    it was never our intent to include
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">HIV/AIDS</FONT>
    patients in the orphan population since the vast majority of
    these patients display malabsorption for reasons other than
    pancreatic insufficiency. We proposed, if necessary, modifying
    our orphan drug designation to clarify the exclusion of HIV/AIDS
    patients. We believe this proposal will enable us to preserve
    our orphan drug designation in the United States. Additionally,
    the FDA has granted ALTU-135 fast track designation and
    admission into its Continuous Marketing Application, or CMA,
    Pilot 2 Program, both of which are designed to facilitate
    interactions between a drug developer and the FDA during the
    drug development process.

    is designed to be injected once-weekly with a fine gauge needle
    for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency and hGH-related
    disorders. Based on reported revenues of existing products,
    global sales of hGH products exceeded $2.5&#160;billion in 2006,
    and the market grew at a compound annual growth rate of
    approximately 9.1% from 2002 to 2006. We are developing ALTU-238
    for both adult and pediatric populations as an alternative to
    current therapies. Current medical guidelines for clinical
    practice generally recommend daily administration of existing
    therapies by subcutaneous injection. In our Phase&#160;I and
    Phase&#160;II clinical trials, ALTU-238 demonstrated
    pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters that are
    consistent with once-weekly administration. In our Phase&#160;II
    study, we identified doses of ALTU-238 that achieved
    insulin-like growth factor&#160;1, or IGF-1, levels within the
    normal range for age and gender over the course of the study.
    IGF-1 is a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the
    growth of bone, muscle and other body tissues in response to hGH
    and, in turn, regulates hGH release from the pituitary gland. In
    addition,
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">once-per-week</FONT>
    dosing of ALTU-238 also appeared to result in a consistent,
    linear dose response of hGH and IGF-1 levels in the blood, which
    we believe will enable physicians and patients to correlate a
    given dose of ALTU-238 to desired levels of hGH and IGF-1 in the
    blood. We believe that the convenience of once-weekly
    administration of ALTU-238, if approved, would improve patient
    acceptance and compliance, and thereby effectiveness.

    We recently entered into an agreement with Genentech to develop,
    manufacture and commercialize ALTU-238. The agreement, which
    became effective on February&#160;21, 2007, provides for an
    exclusive North American collaboration and license arrangement,
    which Genentech has the option to expand to a global
    arrangement. In connection with the North American agreement, we
    anticipate receiving a $15&#160;million up-front payment in
    March 2007. Genentech also purchased 794,575&#160;shares of our
    common stock on February&#160;27, 2007 for an aggregate purchase
    price of $15&#160;million. We have the potential to receive
    additional payments of approximately $148&#160;million based
    upon the achievement of all development and commercialization
    milestones for North America. If Genentech exercises its option
    to extend the collaboration globally, we have the potential to
    receive additional payments of approximately $110&#160;million,
    comprising an option exercise fee and payments contingent upon
    the achievement of all development and commercialization
    milestones relating to countries outside of North America.
    Genentech will be responsible for all ALTU-238 development and
    commercialization costs in North America and, if Genentech
    exercises its option to make this a global agreement, all such
    costs. We have the option to co-promote&#160;ALTU-238 with
    Genentech in North America. If we exercise this option,
    Genentech will pay us for our co-promotion efforts for a limited
    period of time. We are entitled to receive royalties based on
    annual net sales of hGH-related products resulting from the
    collaboration. Genentech has control over the development and
    commercialization of ALTU-238.

    We also have a pipeline of product candidates in preclinical
    research and development that we are designing to address other
    areas of unmet need in gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders.
    Our most advanced preclinical product candidate is ALTU-237,
    which we are developing to treat hyperoxalurias, a series of
    conditions in which too much oxalate is present in the body,
    resulting in an increased risk of developing kidney stones and,
    in rare instances, crystal formations in other organs. Increased
    oxalate in the body can be the result of a variety of factors
    including excess dietary intake of oxalate, genetic disorders of
    metabolism, and disease states such as inflammatory bowel
    disease. The oxalate combines with calcium in the urine causing
    formations of calcium oxalate crystals, which can grow into
    kidney stones. Kidney stones can be a serious medical condition.
    Kidney stones occur in 10% of adult men and 3% of adult women
    during their lifetimes. There are a variety of types of kidney
    stones, but calcium oxalate stones are the most common type

    Our product candidates are based on our proprietary technology,
    which enables the large-scale crystallization of proteins for
    use as therapeutic drugs. We apply our technology to improve
    known protein drugs, as well as to develop other proteins into
    protein therapeutics. For example, our product candidate
    ALTU-135 is based on known enzymes to which we apply our
    proprietary crystallization technology with the goal of offering
    a new and improved drug. We have developed our product candidate
    ALTU-238 by applying our proprietary crystallization technology
    with the goal of offering an improved version of an approved
    drug. We believe that, by using our technology, we are able to
    overcome many of the limitations of existing protein therapies
    and deliver proteins in capsule and alternative dosage forms,
    such as a liquid oral form and extended-release injectable
    formulations. Our product candidates are designed to offer
    improvements over existing products, such as greater
    convenience, better safety and efficacy and longer shelf life.
    In addition, we believe that we may be able to reduce the
    development risk and time to market for our drug candidates
    because we apply our technology to existing, well-understood
    proteins with well-defined mechanisms of action. We believe that
    our technology is broadly applicable to different classes of
    proteins, including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, cytokines and
    peptides. To date, we have crystallized more than 70 proteins
    for use in our research and development programs. We currently
    hold worldwide rights to all of our preclinical product
    candidates<I>.</I>

    Our lead product candidate, ALTU-135, is an orally administered
    enzyme replacement therapy for which we have successfully
    completed a Phase&#160;II clinical trial of its capsule form for
    the treatment of malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic
    insufficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency is a deficiency of the
    digestive enzymes normally produced by the pancreas and can
    result from a number of disease conditions, including cystic
    fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Patients
    with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are currently treated
    with enzyme replacement products containing enzymes derived from
    pig pancreases. We believe that ALTU-135 represents a
    significant potential advancement as a therapeutic alternative
    for the treatment of these patients.

    We have designed ALTU-135 to treat malabsorption resulting from
    exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Malabsorption is the failure
    to absorb adequate amounts of nutrients, such as fats, proteins
    and carbohydrates, in food and is clinically manifested as
    malnutrition, weight loss or poor weight gain, impaired growth,
    abdominal bloating, cramping and chronic diarrhea. Exocrine
    pancreatic insufficiency is a deficiency of digestive enzymes
    normally produced by the pancreas that results in poor
    absorption of essential nutrients from food. If not treated
    appropriately, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency generally leads
    to malnutrition, impaired growth and shortened life expectancy.

    Patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are typically

    extracted from pig pancreases. Many of these products were
    available for human use prior to the passage of the FDCA in
    1938, and all are currently marketed without NDAs approved by
    the FDA. In 1995, the FDA issued a final ruling requiring that
    these pancreatic enzyme products be marketed by prescription
    only, and in April 2004, the FDA issued a notice that
    manufacturers of these products will be subject to regulatory
    action if they do not obtain approved NDAs for these products by
    April&#160;28, 2008. The FDA has also issued guidance, known as
    the PEP Guidance, that existing manufacturers of pancreatic
    enzyme products can follow in order to obtain FDA approval.

    also found in these products. Many manufacturers try to overcome
    this limitation by filling each capsule with more drug than
    specified on the label in order to achieve the stated label
    claim over time. This leads to inconsistent efficacy and raises
    safety concerns. We believe this also contributes to patient
    uncertainty about the number of capsules to take per meal or
    snack.

    We have successfully completed a Phase&#160;II clinical trial of
    the capsule form of ALTU-135 and are preparing to advance this
    product candidate into a pivotal Phase&#160;III clinical
    efficacy trial in patients with cystic fibrosis and a long-term
    safety study in cystic fibrosis patients and chronic
    pancreatitis patients with pancreatic insufficiency, each in the
    second quarter of 2007. The FDA and the EMEA have granted
    ALTU-135 orphan drug designation for malabsorption due to
    exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In December 2006, the FDA
    informed us of its intention to revoke our orphan drug
    designation because it found the prevalence of pancreatic
    insufficiency exceeded the statutory 200,000&#160;patient limit
    if all HIV/AIDS patients who suffer from fat malabsorption were
    included in the patient population. We responded to the FDA that
    it was never our intent to include
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">HIV/AIDS</FONT>
    patients in the orphan population since the vast majority of
    these patients display malabsorption for reasons other than
    pancreatic insufficiency. We proposed, if necessary, modifying
    our orphan drug designation to clarify the exclusion of HIV/AIDS
    patients. We believe this proposal will enable us to preserve
    our orphan drug designation in the United States. The FDA has
    also granted ALTU-135 fast track designation. Fast track
    designation is designed to facilitate the development of new
    drugs and may be granted to a product with a specific indication
    where the FDA agrees that the product is intended to treat a
    serious or life threatening condition and demonstrates the
    potential to address unmet medical needs for that condition.
    Fast track designation also permits drug developers to submit
    sections of an NDA as they become available. In February 2004,
    ALTU-135 was also admitted to the FDA&#146;s CMA Pilot 2
    Program. Under the CMA Pilot 2 program, one fast track
    designated product from each review division of the Center for
    Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, the center at the FDA
    that regulates drugs and therapeutic biologics, and the Center
    for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, the center at
    the FDA that regulates other biologics, is selected for frequent
    scientific feedback and interactions with the FDA, with a goal
    of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the drug
    development process. If the Phase III clinical trial is
    successful, we plan to submit our NDA for ALTU-135 to the FDA in
    the first half of 2009.

    Our clinical trials with cystic fibrosis patients assessed a
    number of different measures, or endpoints, of digestion and
    absorption. We assessed fat absorption by measuring a
    patient&#146;s fat intake over a specified period of time and
    comparing that to the amount of fat in their stool during the
    same period. This comparison enabled us to calculate the amount
    of fat a patient absorbed, using a metric known as the
    coefficient of fat absorption, or CFA. The same process was
    applied to determine protein absorption, using a metric called
    the coefficient of nitrogen absorption, or CNA. We measured
    carbohydrate absorption by analyzing a patient&#146;s blood
    glucose levels after a starch meal, using a test we refer to as
    the starch challenge test. In our Phase&#160;Ib and
    Phase&#160;II clinical trials, we also measured the number and

    After the completion of the Phase&#160;II clinical trial, we

    As part of this work, we evaluated the assays used to measure

    We found that the standard US Pharmacopea, or USP, assay that

    treatment period in cystic fibrosis patients with pancreatic

    To establish a baseline period measurement of fat, protein and

    were tested during a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">72-hour</FONT>
    period when they were not taking enzyme replacement therapy.
    Following this baseline period, ALTU-135 in capsule form was
    orally administered to patients with each of five meals or
    snacks per day for a period of 28&#160;days. In the middle of
    the trial, we performed an additional measurement of fat,
    protein and carbohydrate absorption to establish these
    measurements for the treatment period. For both the baseline and
    treatment period measurements, we assessed fat and protein
    absorption following a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">72-hour,</FONT>
    controlled, high-fat diet by examining stools collected from
    patients. The appropriate period for measuring fat and protein
    absorption was determined by using a blue dye stool marker,
    which facilitated accurate and complete stool collection.
    Changes in carbohydrate absorption were determined by measuring
    blood glucose responses using the starch challenge test. We
    assessed the clinical activity of the lipase component of
    ALTU-135 by measuring the change in CFA, the clinical activity
    of the protease component of ALTU-135 by measuring the change in
    CNA and the clinical activity of the amylase component of

    CFA from the baseline period to the treatment period
    (p-value&#60;0.001) for patients in treatment arms 2 and 3. The
    results of the trial also showed a statistically significant

    We also observed statistically significant improvements in CNA

    The correlation coefficient, r, is the measure of correlation

    ALTU-135 consisting of 32,500&#160;units of lipase,
    25,000&#160;units of protease and 3,750&#160;units of amylase as

    In treatment arm 2 there was an
    average&#160;11.4&#160;percentage point increase in CFA, from
    55.6% to 67.0%, and an average&#160;12.5&#160;percentage point
    increase in CNA, from 58.8% to 71.3%, from the baseline period
    to the treatment period. In treatment arm 3 there was an
    average&#160;17.3&#160;percentage point increase in CFA, from

    significant difference between these results. Based on these
    increases in CFA and CNA, we believe that cystic fibrosis
    patients suffering from malabsorption who are treated with
    ALTU-135 may experience clinically meaningful improvements in
    fat and protein absorption, resulting in an overall improvement
    in nutritional status. We also believe that an improvement in
    nutritional status may lead to weight maintenance or weight gain
    in patients, both of which are important elements in the overall
    health of cystic fibrosis patients and others suffering from
    pancreatic insufficiency. According to the Cystic Fibrosis
    Foundation 2003 Patient Registry, more than 90% of cystic
    fibrosis patients take currently available pancreatic enzyme
    replacement therapies and approximately 35% of cystic fibrosis
    patients are in urgent need of improved nutrition.

    10&#160;percentage points would equate to 10 grams of additional
    fat absorbed per day. According to the FDA, there are nine
    calories in a gram of fat. As a result, an improvement in CFA of
    10&#160;percentage points would equate to an additional 90
    calories absorbed per day. Over a period of one year, such a 90
    calorie per day increase would result in an improvement in
    weight of approximately nine pounds, allowing patients to either
    maintain weight that they may have otherwise lost or gain
    weight. For these reasons, we believe that an improvement in CFA

    began the trial with lower levels of fat and protein absorption
    during the baseline period, as compared with patients who began

    Based on these data, we believe cystic fibrosis patients in
    these subgroups had a clinically meaningful response to
    ALTU-135. In particular, those subjects who had the most severe
    fat or protein malabsorption, which we define as patients with a
    CFA or CNA of 40% or less during the baseline period, responded
    the most from their treatment with ALTU-135. Based on our
    discussions with the FDA to date, we expect that in our
    Phase&#160;III clinical trial of ALTU-135, the FDA will look for
    ALTU-135 to provide patients who have a lower baseline CFA level
    a substantially greater percentage point increase in CFA than
    the percentage point increase in patients who have a higher
    baseline CFA level in order to demonstrate clinically meaningful
    improvement. We believe that a statistically significant
    improvement in carbohydrate absorption will not be required by
    the FDA in order to obtain approval for ALTU-135.

    As noted above, the trial results also indicated a trend toward
    improvement in carbohydrate absorption for patients in treatment
    arms 2 and 3. To obtain additional insight with respect to
    carbohydrate absorption, we further analyzed the data
    retrospectively by examining all three treatment arms using a
    responder analysis that excluded subjects with cystic
    fibrosis-related diabetes, because those subjects were receiving
    diabetes medications that could have confounded the results. In
    this subgroup (n=81), we observed a marked increase in the
    number of subjects whom we considered responders in treatment
    arms 2 and 3 compared to treatment arm 1. We defined responders
    as patients who achieved a minimum predetermined level of
    glucose change during the treatment period as compared to the
    pre-treatment period. The number of subjects achieving this
    response in treatment arm 2 was statistically significant when
    compared to treatment arm 1 (p-value&#60;0.01) and was
    approaching statistical significance for treatment arm 3
    (p-value=0.0644) compared to treatment arm 1.

    There were no major safety concerns identified regarding

    the subjects during the pre-treatment, treatment and
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">follow-up</FONT>
    periods, and are common in the cystic fibrosis population in
    general. We observed, however, more frequent liver transaminase
    elevations in subjects during the treatment and
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">follow-up</FONT>
    periods compared to the pre-treatment period. In a 1999
    published study of 124 children with cystic fibrosis who were
    followed for four years, it was found that 80% had abnormal
    elevations in liver transaminases. Overall transaminase
    elevations experienced by patients in our Phase&#160;II trial
    were transient, asymptomatic and not associated with increases
    in bilirubin. Increases in bilirubin are typically associated
    with harm to the liver. In addition to normal to abnormal
    transaminase shifts, abnormal to normal transaminase shifts were
    also observed across treatment groups. A causal relationship
    between ALTU-135 treatment and elevated liver transaminases is
    unclear because of the underlying liver disease, which is
    estimated to occur in up to 37% of cystic fibrosis patients
    according to published studies, and other complicating factors
    in these patients, including diabetes and infections. We also
    believe that ALTU-135 is not absorbed into the body from the
    gastrointestinal tract.

    We have met with the FDA to discuss the results of our
    Phase&#160;II clinical trial and our planned Phase&#160;III
    clinical trial for the capsule form of ALTU-135. Based on the
    results of our Phase&#160;II clinical trial and our discussions
    with the FDA, we have designed our pivotal Phase&#160;III
    clinical trial of ALTU-135 to be a multicenter, randomized,
    double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to determine, as
    the primary endpoint, the efficacy of ALTU-135 in the treatment
    of fat malabsorption in cystic fibrosis patients with exocrine
    pancreatic insufficiency through measurement of CFA. The trial
    will also include secondary efficacy endpoints, including the
    evaluation of ALTU-135 in the treatment of protein and
    carbohydrate absorption through measurement of CNA and use of
    the starch challenge test and in decreasing the weight and
    frequency of stools in patients. In the trial, we also plan to
    evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALTU-135 over an
    approximate two month dosing period.

    Our current protocol is designed to evaluate approximately 150
    cystic fibrosis patients over the age of seven with exocrine
    pancreatic insufficiency at cystic fibrosis centers primarily in
    the United States and Europe. This sample size is designed to
    allow demonstration of improvements in CFA in the overall study
    population, as well as in the subgroups of patients with
    off-enzyme, baseline CFAs of less than 40% and greater than or
    equal to 40%. Patients with baseline CFAs of greater than 80%
    will be excluded from the trial. At the beginning of the trial,
    we will obtain baseline measurements of fat, protein and
    carbohydrate absorption during a hospital stay of up to one
    week. This hospital stay will begin with a period during which
    the patient will not receive any enzyme replacement therapy. We
    will then assess fat and protein absorption following a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">72-hour,</FONT>
    controlled, high-fat diet by examining stools collected from
    patients. We plan to use a similar high-fat diet and stool
    collection process as we used in our Phase&#160;II trial. The
    timing of the stool collection as well as the amount of stool
    collected will be determined using a blue dye stool marker,
    which facilitates accurate and complete stool collection.
    Changes in carbohydrate absorption will be determined by
    measuring blood glucose responses using the starch challenge
    test.

    3,750&#160;units of amylase with each meal or snack for
    approximately four weeks. The dose of lipase is based on the
    recent manufacturing and assay work that we performed, which
    demonstrated that the middle dose in our Phase&#160;II clinical
    trial contained 32,500&#160;units of lipase activity. After this
    four-week period, patients will return to the hospital for up to
    one week for a second in-hospital stay. During this hospital
    stay, patients will be randomized on a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">one-to-one</FONT>
    basis, and stratified based on whether their baseline
    measurements of CFA place them in the subgroup of patients
    having absorption of less than 40% or the subgroup of patients
    having absorption of greater than or equal to 40% but not more
    than 80% to receive either ALTU-135 or placebo. Fat, protein and

    ALTU-238 is a crystallized formulation of hGH that is designed
    to be administered once weekly through a fine-gauge needle for
    the treatment of hGH disorders in both pediatric and adult
    populations. Based on reported revenues of existing products,
    these indications generated approximately $2.5&#160;billion in
    worldwide sales of hGH in 2006, and the market grew at a
    compound annual growth rate of approximately 9.1% from 2002 to
    2006. We are developing ALTU-238 as a long-acting, growth
    hormone product that can allow patients to avoid the
    inconvenience of daily injections as recommended by current
    medical guidelines for existing products. We have used our
    proprietary protein crystallization technology and formulation
    expertise to develop ALTU-238 without altering the underlying
    molecule or requiring polymer encapsulation. Since hGH is a
    known protein molecule with an established record of safety and
    efficacy, we believe that ALTU-238 may have less development
    risk than most pharmaceutical product candidates at a similar
    stage of development.

    We have successfully completed two clinical trials of ALTU-238,
    a Phase&#160;I trial in healthy adults and a Phase&#160;II trial
    in growth hormone deficient adults. Both trials were designed to
    determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
    ALTU-238. Pharmacokinetics refers to the process by which a drug
    is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and eliminated by the
    body. Pharmacodynamics refers to the process by which a drug
    exerts its biological effect. In the Phase&#160;II trial,
    ALTU-238 demonstrated a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
    profile that we believe is supportive of a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">once-per-week</FONT>
    dosing regimen for growth hormone deficient adults. The study
    identified doses of ALTU-238 that achieved IGF-1 levels within
    the normal range for age and gender over the course of the
    study. IGF-1 is a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates
    the growth of bone, muscle and other body tissues in response to
    hGH and, in turn, regulates hGH release from the pituitary
    gland. The study also indicated that
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">once-per-week</FONT>
    dosing of ALTU-238 appeared to result in a consistent, linear
    dose response of hGH and IGF-1 levels in the blood. ALTU-238 was
    generally well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse
    events reported in either study.

    Growth hormone, which is secreted by the pituitary gland, is the
    major regulator of growth in the body. Growth hormone directly
    stimulates the areas of bones known as epiphyseal growth plates,
    which are responsible for bone elongation and growth. Growth
    hormone also causes growth indirectly by triggering the release
    of insulin-like growth factor&#160;1, or IGF-1, from tissues
    throughout the body. In addition, growth hormone contributes to
    proper bone density and plays an important role in various
    metabolic functions, including lipid breakdown, protein
    synthesis and insulin regulation.

    Growth hormone deficiency typically results from an abnormality
    within the pituitary gland that impairs its ability to produce
    or secrete growth hormone. A deficiency of growth hormone can
    result in reduced growth in children and lead to short stature.
    Because the growth plates in the long bones fuse and additional
    cartilage and bone growth can no longer occur after puberty, hGH
    replacement therapy does not cause growth in adults. However,
    low levels of hGH in adults are also frequently associated with
    other metabolic disorders, including lipid abnormalities,
    decreased bone density, obesity, insulin resistance, decreased
    cardiac performance and decreased muscle mass. These disorders
    typically become increasingly apparent after a prolonged period
    of hGH deficiency, as occurs in adulthood.

    Growth hormone is also used to treat Turner Syndrome, Prader
    Willi Syndrome and short bowel syndrome. The percentage of
    patients for whom hGH is prescribed varies significantly by
    indication. We believe that a once-weekly formulation of hGH,
    such as ALTU-238, may result in increased use in a number of
    these indications.

    Currently, many of the FDA-approved hGH products are also in
    clinical development for additional indications, including
    Crohn&#146;s disease, female infertility, bone regeneration and
    a variety of other genetic and metabolic disorders. There are
    currently ten FDA-approved hGH products on the market in the
    United States from eight manufacturers, all of which use
    essentially the same underlying hGH molecule. Current medical
    guidelines for clinical practice generally recommend daily
    administration of existing products by subcutaneous injection.
    We believe that the primary differences between these products
    relate to their formulation and the devices employed for their
    delivery.

    We believe that the burden of frequent injections significantly
    impacts quality of life for both adults and children being
    treated with hGH therapy and often leads to reduced compliance
    or a reluctance to initiate therapy. For example, we estimate
    that a standard course of treatment for pediatric growth hormone
    deficient patients typically lasts approximately six years and
    requires more than 1,800 injections. Faced with this protracted
    treatment regime, pediatric patients often take &#147;days
    off&#148; and miss treatment. For adults with growth hormone
    deficiency, the benefits of hGH treatment are more subtle and
    relate to metabolic function and organ health instead of
    increased height. As a consequence, and in contrast to hGH
    deficient children, many adults with growth hormone deficiency
    do not initiate hGH therapy, and of those who do, many fail to
    continue treatment.

    was withdrawn from the market and required polymeric
    encapsulation for its extended release formulation. This
    necessitated the use of a substantially larger needle and
    prolonged injection time. We have designed ALTU-238 using our
    protein crystallization technology so that, as the crystals
    dissolve, the hGH is released over an extended period. This
    allows ALTU-238 to be administered with a 29 or 30 gauge,
    insulin-like needle.

    Hyperoxalurias are a series of conditions where too much oxalate
    is present in the body resulting in an increased risk of kidney
    stones and, in rare instances, crystal formations in other
    organs. Increased oxalate in the body can result from eating
    foods that are high in oxalate, over-absorption of oxalate from
    the intestinal tract, and abnormalities of oxalate production by
    the body. Oxalate is a natural end-product of metabolism, does
    not appear to be needed for any human body process and is
    normally more than 90% excreted by the kidney. Since calcium is
    also continuously excreted by the kidney into the urine, oxalate
    can combine with calcium, causing formations of calcium-oxalate
    crystals which can grow into a kidney stone. In preclinical
    studies using rodent models, ALTU-237, delivered orally,
    demonstrated an ability to reduce oxalate levels in urine. We
    believe that reducing oxalate levels in urine may be indicative
    of a reduction of oxalate in the body and therefore may result
    in a decrease in kidney stones.

    Over-absorption of oxalate from the intestinal tract, or enteric
    hyperoxaluria, is often associated with intestinal diseases such
    as inflammatory bowel disease and cystic fibrosis, or may occur
    in patients following gastric surgery. Primary hyperoxaluria is
    a rare, inherited and, if left untreated, fatal metabolic
    disease that results in the accumulation of oxalate in the body.
    Although there are variations in the disease, primary
    hyperoxaluria is characterized by the shortage of an enzyme in
    the liver, which results in excess levels of oxalate production
    in the body. Unfortunately, oxalate cannot be further
    metabolized, and it can only be eliminated from the body by the
    kidney, leading to an increase in urinary excretion, and causing
    hyperoxaluria. Based on prevalence data from an industry
    article, we estimate that between
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">1-in-60,000</FONT>
    and
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">1-in-120,000</FONT>

    According to the National Kidney Foundation, kidney stone
    disease is a common disorder of the urinary tract affecting
    approximately 20&#160;million Americans. According to Disease

    In a series of preclinical studies using rodent models,
    ALTU-237, delivered orally, demonstrated an ability to reduce
    oxalate levels in urine. One such study was designed to measure
    the impact of ALTU-237 on the reduction of hyperoxaluria in a
    genetic mouse model for primary hyperoxaluria. In this study,
    the mice were further challenged with ethylene glycol to mimic

    In the study, ALTU-237 therapy resulted in a sustained reduction
    of urinary oxalate levels as evidenced by a reduction in urinary
    oxalate of 30 to 50&#160;percent in all treatment groups as
    compared to the control group. In addition, a reduction in

    Based in part on these results, we believe ALTU-237 could be the
    first effective oral therapeutic agent specifically designed to
    reduce oxalate levels and prevent the formation of kidney
    stones. Furthermore, we believe that these results suggest that
    we may be able to use our proprietary protein crystallization
    technology to orally deliver enzymes to the gastrointestinal
    tract, where they can exert a therapeutic effect by drawing out
    toxic metabolites from the body. This therapeutic approach is
    currently utilized by some existing drugs. For example, Renagel,
    marketed by Genzyme Corporation, removes excess levels of
    phosphate in the body in patients with chronic kidney disease by
    delivering drug to the gastrointestinal tract, where it binds to
    the phosphate and removes it from the body. If we are successful
    in our design of ALTU-237, we believe that this program will
    provide a template for our other research and preclinical
    programs that rely on the same fundamental science and mechanism
    of action.

    We are also developing ALTU-236, an orally-administered enzyme
    replacement therapy designed to reduce the long-term effects
    associated with excess levels of phenylalanine, also known as
    hyperphenylalanemia. According to the National Institutes of
    Health, phenylketonuria, or PKU, which is the most severe form
    of hyperphenylalanemia, affects approximately
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">1-in-15,000</FONT>
    newborns in the United States. PKU is a rare, inherited,
    metabolic disorder that results from an enzyme deficiency that
    causes the accumulation of the amino acid phenylalanine in the
    body. If left untreated, PKU can result in mental retardation,
    swelling of the brain, delayed speech, seizures and behavior
    abnormalities. Virtually all newborns in the United States and
    in many other countries are screened prior to leaving the
    hospital for PKU. PKU and hyperphenylalanemia are currently
    treated by placing patients on a phenylalanine restricted diet.
    This diet is expensive and difficult to maintain and does not
    avoid many of the long-term effects of PKU. There are currently
    no approved drugs to treat PKU. We are currently testing
    ALTU-236 in animal models.

    To date, we have purchased hGH from Sandoz GmbH, or Sandoz, a

    In our agreement with Genentech, we are initially responsible
    for the manufacture and supply of clinical quantities of
    ALTU-238 using hGH supplied by Genentech until Genentech
    determines otherwise. We have completed small-scale cGMP runs of
    ALTU-238 at a contract manufacturer for our completed
    Phase&#160;I and II clinical trials. However, we will need to
    produce ALTU-238 for our future clinical trials at a larger
    scale. To do so, we entered into a drug production and clinical
    supply agreement with Althea Technologies, Inc., or Althea, in
    August 2006. Under this agreement, Althea has agreed to modify
    an existing production facility, and test and validate its
    manufacturing operations for the production of ALTU-238. The
    agreement terminates following the production of a defined
    number of manufacturing runs of ALTU-238, from which we intend
    to supply planned clinical trials. The agreement is subject to
    early termination by either party in the event of an uncured
    material breach by or bankruptcy of the other party.
    Althea&#146;s liability to us for any breach of the agreement is
    limited to an obligation to replace those products which do not
    conform to requirements.

    In addition, we and Althea have agreed to negotiate an agreement
    under which Althea will provide ALTU-238 for commercial supply.
    If, within one year after the termination or expiration of the
    agreement, other than a termination due to Althea&#146;s uncured
    material breach, we enter into an agreement with a third party
    to provide commercial supply of ALTU-238, we must make a

    plan to establish a commercial infrastructure and targeted
    specialty sales force to market our product candidates in North
    America. Our sales efforts for ALTU-135, if approved, will
    initially be focused on the 500 pediatric pulmonologists who are
    in approximately 100 cystic fibrosis care centers throughout the
    United States, as well as the 5,000 key gastroenterologists and
    pancreatologists who prescribe products for exocrine pancreatic
    insufficiency. For ALTU-238, we may exercise our option to
    co-promote&#160;ALTU-238 in North America, in which case we
    would initially focus on the approximately 400 key prescribing
    pediatric endocrinologists and approximately 3,000 adult
    endocrinologists who treat patients with growth hormone
    deficiency. Because the target groups for ALTU-238 are primarily
    hospital-based and concentrated in major metropolitan areas, we
    believe that the market for ALTU-238 can be addressed with a
    specialized sales force that targets these key prescribers. We
    also plan to leverage our sales and marketing capabilities by
    targeting the same groups of physician specialists with multiple
    products that we bring to market either through our own
    development efforts or by in-licensing from others.

    The patent positions of companies like ours are generally
    uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our
    ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for
    our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective
    claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know
    whether any of our patent applications or those patent
    applications that are licensed to us will result in the issuance
    of any patents or if issued will assist our business. Our issued
    patents and those that may issue in the future, or those
    licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.
    This could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing
    related products and reduce the length of term of patent
    protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the
    rights granted under any of our issued patents may not provide
    us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against
    competitors with similar technology. Our competitors may develop
    similar technologies, duplicate any technology developed by us,
    or use their patent rights to block us from taking the full
    advantage of the market. Because of the extensive time required
    for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential
    product, it is possible that a related patent may remain in
    force for a short period following commercialization, thereby
    reducing the advantage of the patent to our business and
    products.

    Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development,
    it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests
    include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity
    and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must
    submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with
    manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as
    part of the IND. Some preclinical or non-clinical testing may
    continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to
    including the results of the preclinical studies, the IND will
    also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the
    objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the
    parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the
    effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends

    period, specifically places the clinical trial on clinical hold.
    The FDA can also place a trial on clinical hold at any time

    Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete

    must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the
    product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for
    testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs.

    The results of product development, preclinical studies and

    process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the

    approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA
    is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such
    fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA
    reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for
    filing. It may request additional information rather than accept
    an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be

    Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an
    in-depth review. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if
    the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may
    require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data is
    submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA
    does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews an
    NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe
    and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacture
    is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product&#146;s
    identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to
    determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure
    and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured,
    processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the
    product&#146;s continued safety, purity and potency. Before
    approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or

    Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of
    state, local and foreign regulatory authorities typically takes
    at least several years and the actual time required may vary
    substantially, based upon, among other things, the type,
    complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Government
    regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products
    for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures
    upon our activities. Success in early stage clinical trials does
    not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained
    from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be
    susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit
    or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval
    on a timely basis, or at all. Even if a product receives
    regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited
    to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may
    otherwise be limited which could restrict the commercial
    application of the products. Further, even after regulatory
    approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown
    problems with a product may result in restrictions on the
    product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the
    market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory
    approvals for any drug candidate could substantially harm our
    business and cause our stock price to drop significantly. In

    approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be
    eligible for these programs are those for serious or
    life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address
    unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits
    over existing treatments. Fast track designation applies to the
    combination of the product and the specific indication for which
    it is being studied. Although fast track and priority review do
    not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to
    facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a
    fast-track designated drug and expedite review of the
    application for a drug designated for priority review. Drugs
    that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the
    basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials
    establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate
    endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit
    or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than
    survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval,
    the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving
    accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.

    The FDA initially granted orphan drug designation for ALTU-135.
    In December 2006, the FDA informed us of its intention to revoke

    200,000&#160;patient limit if all HIV/AIDS patients who suffer
    from fat malabsorption were included in the patient population.
    We responded to the FDA that it was never our intent to include
    HIV/AIDS patients in the orphan population since the vast
    majority of these patients displaying malabsorption do so for
    reasons other than pancreatic insufficiency. We proposed, if
    necessary, modifying our orphan drug designation to clarify the

    products, whether marketed on an OTC or a prescription basis,
    were new drugs for which an approved application would be

    Under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing
    authorization applications either under a centralized or
    decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is
    compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology and optional
    for those which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of
    a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European
    Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for
    mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this
    procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may
    submit an application to the remaining member states. Within
    90&#160;days of receiving the applications and assessments
    report each member state must decide whether to recognize
    approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing
    authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to
    the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member
    states.

    Sales of biopharmaceutical products depend in significant part
    on the availability of coverage through third-party payment
    systems. We anticipate third-party payors will provide coverage
    and reimbursement for our products. It will be time consuming
    and expensive for us to seek coverage from third-party payors
    for newly-approved drugs, and the scope of such coverage might
    be more limited than the purposes for which the FDA approves the
    drug. Eligibility for coverage does not imply that any drug will
    be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that would be sufficient
    to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable
    basis. Interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, might not
    be sufficient to cover our costs, and such payment might not be
    made permanent. Reimbursement rates vary according to the use of
    the drug, the clinical setting in which it is used, and whether
    it is administered by a physician in connection with a specific
    service or procedure. Reimbursement rates may be based upon
    payments allowed for lower-cost products that are already
    covered; may be incorporated into unprofitable composite rates
    for other services; and may reflect budgetary constraints,
    political considerations, and imperfections in data affecting
    government-funded health care programs. Drug prices may be
    reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates imposed by third party
    payors. Third party payors often follow the coverage and
    reimbursement policies established by government-funded health
    care programs such as Medicare. As a result, Medicare coverage
    and reimbursement policies may affect the pricing and
    profitability of drugs whether or not Medicare beneficiaries are
    expected to comprise a significant portion of the patients using
    the drug.

    The levels of revenues and profitability of biopharmaceutical
    companies may also be affected by the continuing efforts of
    government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs
    of health care through various means. For example, in some
    foreign markets, pricing reimbursement or profitability of
    therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to
    governmental control. In Canada, this practice has led to lower
    priced drugs than in the United States. As a result, importation
    of drugs from Canada into the United States may result in
    reduced product revenues.

    In the United States there have been, and we expect that there
    will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to
    implement governmental pricing reimbursement controls. The
    Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 imposed
    new requirements for the distribution and pricing of
    prescription drugs that may affect the marketing of our
    products, if we obtain FDA approval for those products. Under
    this law, Medicare was extended to cover a wide range of
    prescription drugs other than those directly administered by
    physicians in a hospital or medical office. Competitive regional
    private drug plans were authorized to establish lists of
    approved drugs, or formularies, and to negotiate rebates and
    other price control arrangements with drug companies. Proposals
    to allow the government to directly negotiate Medicare drug
    prices with drug companies, if enacted, might further constrain
    drug prices, leading to reduced revenues and profitability.

    In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for
    a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The
    requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to
    country. For example, the European Union provides options for
    its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products
    for which their national health insurance systems provide
    reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products
    for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for
    the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct
    or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing
    the medicinal product on the market.

    We have entered into a collaboration agreement with
    Dr.&#160;Falk. We have received substantial funding from
    Dr.&#160;Falk for the development and commercialization of
    ALTU-135 in Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union,
    Egypt and Israel, and we are eligible to receive additional
    payments if we achieve specified milestones under the agreement.
    Dr.&#160;Falk has asserted that there is a third-party European
    patent issued in specified countries, including Germany, France
    and the United Kingdom, with claims that may be relevant to
    ALTU-135 and, therefore, that we breached a representation in
    our agreement with Dr.&#160;Falk and may be liable for damages
    under our agreement. We do not believe that we breached our
    agreement, and we have been in discussions with Dr.&#160;Falk
    for some time to resolve this matter. We also believe that if
    this patent were asserted against us, it is likely that we would
    not be found to infringe any valid claim of the patent relevant
    to our development and commercialization of ALTU-135. However,
    if the patent were successfully asserted against us or
    Dr.&#160;Falk and we were unable to obtain a license on
    commercially acceptable terms, we and Dr.&#160;Falk would be
    prevented during the patent term from commercializing ALTU-135
    in the covered countries. Based on our current development
    timeline for ALTU-135 in Europe and excluding any patent term
    extensions, we expect that the patent in question would expire
    approximately two years after we would expect to receive
    marketing authorization for ALTU-135 in Europe. We may not reach
    a resolution of this matter with Dr.&#160;Falk, or prevail if
    the patent were asserted against us, or, if necessary, be able
    to obtain a license under the patent on commercially acceptable
    terms, if at all. If we are unable to do so, our business could

    The ability to recruit and enroll patients in a Phase&#160;III
    clinical trial and a safety study for ALTU-135 depends on the
    availability and willingness of patients to participate in
    experimental research, the conduct of recruitment activities
    that respect human subject protection, and recommendations by
    physicians to their patients to participate in our clinical
    trials. We have limited experience with earlier stage clinical
    trials, and we are developing our capabilities to conduct
    Phase&#160;III clinical trials, which usually involve a larger
    number of patients. However, in the execution of any
    Phase&#160;III clinical trial, we intend to rely in part on
    third party contractors to assist with these activities. The
    design of our Phase&#160;III clinical trial for ALTU-135
    includes one off-enzyme period for all patients and an
    additional off-enzyme period for half of the patients, which may
    make it difficult to enroll patients and, if enrolled, may cause
    them to drop out of the trial. Off-enzyme periods can be
    uncomfortable for these patients. Any predictions about the
    timing of enrollment or the completion of clinical trials are
    subject to the risks inherent in these activities.

    group who developed distal intestinal obstructive syndrome, or
    DIOS, which resolved itself without further complications. DIOS
    is a condition that is unique to cystic fibrosis and occurs due
    to the accumulation of viscous mucous and fecal material in the
    colon. According to a 1987 study, DIOS is relatively common in
    cystic fibrosis patients, occurring in about 16% of those
    patients. In our Phase&#160;II clinical trial of ALTU-135, we
    also observed elevated levels of liver transaminases, which can
    be associated with harm to the liver. These elevations were
    transient and asymptomatic and were not reported as drug-related
    serious adverse events. Elevation of liver transaminases is
    common among cystic fibrosis patients. The elevations we

    increases we observed were not associated with increases in
    bilirubin, which are typically associated with harm to the liver.

    Our clinical trials and those of our collaborators may not begin
    as planned, may need to be redesigned, and may not be completed
    on schedule, if at all. For example, on July&#160;24, 2006, we

    development work before initiating the planned Phase&#160;III
    clinical trial of ALTU-135 in order to ensure a consistent

    several changes to the design specifications for that equipment,
    which would result in a delay in the initiation of planned
    Phase&#160;III trials of ALTU-238. Delays in our clinical trials

    obtain regulatory approval in the European&#160;Union. Our
    agreement with Dr.&#160;Falk contemplates that we will conduct a
    combined Phase&#160;III clinical trial, with both United States
    and European clinical sites, to be performed in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of both the FDA and the EMEA.
    However, the FDA has not required a comparison of ALTU-135 with
    a currently marketed pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in a
    clinical trial and, in light of what we believe to be the
    different requirements of the FDA and EMEA, we are discussing
    with Dr.&#160;Falk an alternate strategy for the Phase&#160;III
    clinical development of ALTU-135 in the European Union. A
    failure to develop and reach agreement on a successful strategy
    with Dr.&#160;Falk could result in the delay of or prevent the
    marketing approval of
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">ALTU-135</FONT> by
    the EMEA and could also result in a claim by Dr.&#160;Falk that
    we breached our agreement with them. If we agree on a strategy
    that involves a comparison of ALTU-135 with a currently marketed
    pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in Europe, it is possible
    the FDA could delay its approval of ALTU-135 until the
    comparison study is completed. If the study is completed and it
    does not demonstrate an advantage of
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">ALTU-135</FONT>
    over the currently marketed pancreatic enzyme replacement
    therapy, the commercial profitability and viability of ALTU-135
    could be materially and adversely affected in Europe as well as
    the United States.

    ALTU-238 for the planned clinical trials of ALTU-238. Although
    Genentech has agreed to supply the hGH for commercialization of
    ALTU-238, we or Genentech will need to negotiate an additional
    agreement under which Althea would provide the commercial supply
    of ALTU-238 or find an alternative commercial manufacturer.
    Switching manufacturers would require cooperation with Althea,
    technology transfers, training, and validation of the
    alternative manufacturer&#146;s processes, and, under some
    circumstances, will require us to make a specified payment to
    Althea. Changes in manufacturing processes or procedures,
    including a change in the location where the drug is
    manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, may
    require prior review and approval from the FDA and satisfaction
    of comparable foreign requirements. This review may be costly
    and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a
    product. If we or Genentech are unable to secure another
    contract manufacturer for ALTU-238 at an acceptable cost, the
    commercialization of ALTU-238 could be delayed, prevented or
    impaired, and the costs related to ALTU-238 may increase. Any
    dispute over the terms of, or decisions regarding, our
    collaboration with Althea or other adverse developments in our
    relationship would materially harm our business and might
    accelerate our need for additional capital.

    In the United States there have been, and we expect that there
    will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to
    implement governmental pricing reimbursement controls. The
    Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 imposed
    new requirements for the distribution and pricing of
    prescription drugs that may affect the marketing of our
    products, if we obtain FDA approval for those products. Under
    this law, Medicare was extended to cover a wide range of
    prescription drugs other than those directly administered by
    physicians in a hospital or medical office. Competitive regional
    private drug plans were authorized to establish lists of
    approved drugs, or formularies, and to negotiate rebates and
    other price control arrangements with drug companies. Proposals
    to allow the government to directly negotiate Medicare drug
    prices with drug companies, if enacted, might further constrain
    drug prices, leading to reduced revenues and profitability.
    While we cannot predict whether any future legislative or
    regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such
    proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and profitability.

    In some foreign countries, particularly the countries of the
    European Union, Canada and Japan, the pricing of prescription
    pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these
    countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities
    can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing
    approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing
    approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a
    clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our
    product candidate to other available therapies. In some
    countries, the pricing is limited by the pricing of existing or
    comparable therapies. If reimbursement of our products is

    Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain
    and enforce our intellectual property rights both domestically
    and abroad. The patent position of biotechnology companies is

    Our patents may not protect us against our competitors. The

    patents can be challenged in litigation. Such litigation is
    often complex, can involve substantial costs and distraction and
    the outcome of patent litigation is often uncertain. If the
    outcome is adverse to us, third parties may be able to use our
    patented inventions and compete directly with us, without
    payment to us. Third parties may also be able to circumvent our

    Because patent applications in the United States and many

    often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our

    the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending

    for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent
    applications. Assuming the other requirements for patentability
    are met, in the United States, the first to make the claimed

    Our ability to commercialize our product candidates depends on
    our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product
    candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third
    parties. Third parties may allege our product candidates
    infringe their intellectual property rights. Numerous United
    States and foreign patents and pending patent applications,
    which are owned by third parties, exist in fields that relate to
    our product candidates and our underlying technology, including
    patents and patent applications claiming compositions of matter
    of, methods of manufacturing, and methods of treatment using,

    foreign patents that may be relevant to the development and

    that we would not be found to infringe any valid claim of the
    patents relevant to our development and commercialization of

    successfully asserted against us. We do not believe that

    Although we believe it is unlikely that we would be found to
    infringe any valid claim of these patents, we may not succeed in
    any action in which the patents are asserted against us. In
    order to successfully challenge the validity of any United
    States patent, we would need to overcome a presumption of
    validity. This burden is a high one requiring clear and
    convincing evidence. If any of these patents were found to be
    valid and we were found to infringe any of them, or any other
    patent rights of third parties, we would be required to pay
    damages, stop the infringing activity or obtain licenses in
    order to use, manufacture or sell our product candidates. Any
    required license might not be available to us on acceptable
    terms, or at all. If we succeeded in obtaining these licenses,
    payments under these licenses would reduce any earnings from our
    products. In addition, some licenses might be non-exclusive and,
    accordingly, our competitors might gain access to the same
    technology as that which was licensed to us. If we failed to
    obtain a required license or were unable to alter the design of
    our product candidates to make the licenses unnecessary, we
    might be unable to commercialize one or more of our product
    candidates, which could significantly affect our ability to

    In order to protect or enforce our patent rights, defend our

    patent litigation against third parties, such as infringement
    suits or nullity, opposition or interference proceedings. We and
    our collaborators may enforce our patent rights under the terms
    of our major collaboration and license agreements, but neither
    we nor our collaborators is required to do so. In addition,

    Intellectual property litigation is relatively common in our
    industry and can be costly. Even if we prevail, the cost of such

    and resources away from our business. Furthermore, during the
    course of litigation, confidential information may be disclosed
    in the form of documents or testimony in connection with
    discovery requests, depositions or trial testimony. Disclosure
    of our confidential information and our involvement in
    intellectual property litigation could materially adversely
    affect our business. Some of our competitors may be able to
    sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively
    than we can because they have substantially greater resources.

    December&#160;31, 2006. Our success depends on our ability to
    attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and
    scientific personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on
    Sheldon Berkle, our President and Chief Executive Officer,
    Dr.&#160;Alexey L. Margolin, our Chief Scientific Officer, and
    the other principal members of our executive and scientific
    teams. All of the arrangements with these principal members of
    our executive and scientific teams may be terminated by us or
    the employee at any time without notice. Although we do not have
    any reason to believe that we may lose the services of any of
    these persons in the foreseeable future, the loss of the
    services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of
    our research, development and commercialization objectives.

    Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and
    sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our
    success. We may not be able to attract and retain these
    personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among
    numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar
    personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of
    scientific personnel from universities and research
    institutions. We do not maintain &#147;key person&#148;
    insurance on any of our employees.

    As we advance our drug candidates through the development

    manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities or contract with
    other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. As our
    operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage
    additional relationships with various contract manufacturers,
    collaborative partners, suppliers and other organizations. Our
    ability to manage our operations and growth requires us to
    continue to improve our operational, financial and management
    controls, reporting systems and procedures. Such growth could
    place a strain on our management, administrative and operational
    infrastructure. We may not be able to make improvements to our
    management information and control systems in an efficient or

    Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
    make estimates, accruals and judgments that affect the reported
    amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
    related disclosure. Such estimates and judgments include the
    carrying value of our property, equipment and other assets,
    revenue recognition and the value of certain accrued expenses.
    We base our estimates, accruals and judgments on historical
    experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to
    be reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates
    and judgments, or the assumptions underlying them, may change
    over time. For example, since the inception of our collaboration
    agreements with CFFTI and Dr.&#160;Falk, we have adjusted our
    estimated costs to complete the development program for ALTU-135
    on four occasions, including during the third quarters of 2005
    and 2006, resulting in cumulative changes in our revenue at each
    time of the change in the estimate. During the third quarter of
    2005, we reduced our estimated development costs for ALTU-135,
    which resulted in a $3.3&#160;million increase in our cumulative
    revenue in the third quarter of 2005. During the third quarter
    of 2006, we increased our estimated development costs for
    ALTU-135, which resulted in a $3.7&#160;million decrease in our
    cumulative revenue in the third quarter of 2006. Given the
    possibility that our estimates may change, our actual financial
    results may vary significantly from the estimates contained in
    our financial statements and our stock price could be adversely
    affected.

    A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might

    We registered shares of our common stock in connection with our

    in connection with our initial public offering was declared
    effective by the SEC on January&#160;25, 2006. The offering
    commenced as of January&#160;26, 2006 and did not terminate
    before all securities were sold. The offering was
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">co-managed</FONT>
    by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&#160;&#38; Smith Incorporated,
    Morgan Stanley&#160;&#38; Co. Incorporated and Cowen and
    Company, LLC. A total of 8,050,000&#160;shares of common stock
    was registered and sold in the initial public offering,
    including 1,050,000&#160;shares of common stock sold upon
    exercise of the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option. No
    payments for expenses related to the initial public offering
    were made directly or indirectly to (i)&#160;any of our
    directors, officers, or their associates, (ii)&#160;any person
    owning 10% or more of any class of our equity securities, or
    (iii)&#160;any of our affiliates. The net proceeds of the
    initial public offering, approximately $110.2&#160;million, were
    invested in investment grade securities. The dollar weighted
    average effective maturity of the portfolio is less than
    9&#160;months, and no security has an effective maturity in
    excess of 12&#160;months. As of February&#160;28, 2007, we have
    used approximately $60&#160;million of the net proceeds of the
    initial public offering to fund our operations including
    preparatory activities for the Phase&#160;III trial for the
    capsule form of
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">ALTU-135,</FONT>
    activities related to the Phase&#160;II trial of ALTU-238 and
    preparation for Phase&#160;III trials, activities related to the
    development of our preclinical product candidates and general
    corporate purposes. There has been no material change in the
    planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering as
    described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to
    Rule&#160;424(b).

    8,669&#160;shares of common stock to employees or former

    pursuant to written compensatory plans or arrangements with our

    We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development
    and commercialization of oral and injectable protein
    therapeutics for gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders, with
    two product candidates in clinical development. We are using our
    proprietary protein crystallization technology to develop
    protein therapies, which we believe will have significant
    advantages over existing products and will address unmet medical
    needs. Our product candidates are designed to either increase
    the amount of a protein that is in short supply in the body or
    degrade the toxic metabolites in the gut and remove them from
    the blood stream. Our two lead product candidates are ALTU-135,
    for which we have completed a Phase&#160;II clinical trial in
    cystic fibrosis patients for the treatment of malabsorption due
    to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and ALTU-238, for which we
    have completed a Phase&#160;II clinical trial in adults for the
    treatment of growth hormone deficiency. Our lead preclinical
    product candidate, ALTU-237, is an orally-administered
    crystalline formulation of an oxalate-degrading enzyme, which we
    have designed for the treatment of hyperoxalurias. We plan to
    file an IND for ALTU-237 for the treatment of hyperoxalurias in
    the first half of 2007. We also have a pipeline of other product
    candidates in preclinical research and development. We have
    generated significant losses as we have advanced our lead
    product candidates in clinical development and expect to
    continue to generate losses as ALTU-135 and ALTU-238 move into
    later stages of clinical development, and as ALTU-237 and our
    other pre-clinical product candidates advance to clinical
    trials. As of December&#160;31, 2006, we had an accumulated
    deficit of $175.8&#160;million.

    On January&#160;31, 2006, we completed an initial public

    In February 2001, we entered into a strategic alliance agreement
    with CFFTI to collaborate on the development of ALTU-135 and
    specified derivatives of ALTU-135 in North America for the
    treatment of malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic
    insufficiency in patients with cystic fibrosis and other
    indications. The agreement, in general terms, provides us with
    funding from CFFTI for a portion of the development costs of
    ALTU-135 upon the achievement of specified development
    milestones, up to a total of $25.0&#160;million, in return for
    specified payment obligations and our obligation to use good
    faith reasonable efforts to develop and bring ALTU-135 to market
    in North America. As of December&#160;31, 2006, we had received
    a total of $18.4&#160;million of the $25.0&#160;million
    available under the CFFTI agreement and recognized cumulative
    revenue of $11.8&#160;million. Under the terms of the agreement,
    we may receive an additional milestone payment of
    $6.6&#160;million, less an amount determined by when we achieve
    the milestone.

    $1.5&#160;million to CFFTI within 30&#160;days after the

    CFFTI consisting of a percentage of worldwide net sales by us or
    our sublicensees of ALTU-135 for any and all indications until
    the expiration of specified United States patents covering
    ALTU-135. We have the option to terminate our ongoing royalty
    obligation by making a one-time payment to CFFTI, but we
    currently do not expect to do so. Under the agreement, CFFTI has
    also agreed to provide us with reasonable access to its network

    common stock at an exercise price of $0.02&#160;per share,
    including 174,443 warrants with a fair value of

    recognized as a discount to contract revenue and amortized
    against the gross revenue earned under the contract. As of
    December&#160;31, 2006, approximately $0.9&#160;million remains

    In December 2002, we entered into a development,
    commercialization and marketing agreement with Dr.&#160;Falk for
    the development by us of ALTU-135 and the commercialization by
    Dr.&#160;Falk of ALTU-135, if approved, in Europe, the countries
    of the former Soviet Union, Israel and Egypt. Under the
    agreement, we granted Dr.&#160;Falk an exclusive, sublicensable
    license under specified patents that cover ALTU-135 to
    commercialize ALTU-135 for the treatment of symptoms caused by
    exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. As of December&#160;31, 2006,
    we had received upfront and milestone payments from
    Dr.&#160;Falk under the agreement totaling
    &#128;11.0&#160;million, which equated to $12.9&#160;million
    based on exchange rates in effect at the times we received the
    milestone payments, and recognized cumulative revenue of
    $10.2&#160;million. Because our planned Phase&#160;III clinical
    trial is not an international Phase&#160;III clinical trial
    which supports EMEA marketing approval, we do not expect to
    receive any reimbursement from Dr.&#160;Falk for this trial.
    Dr.&#160;Falk holds all commercialization and marketing rights
    in the licensed territory, and we are entitled to receive
    royalties based on the net sales of ALTU-135 in the licensed
    territory and revenue for the ALTU-135 capsules supplied by us

    In December 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
    Genentech, Inc. for the development, manufacture and
    commercialization of ALTU-238. The effective date of the
    agreement was February&#160;21, 2007, following expiration of
    the waiting period under the
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Hart-Scott-Rodino</FONT>
    Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Under the terms
    of the agreement, we granted Genentech exclusive rights and a
    license to make and have made, use and import ALTU-238, and to
    sell ALTU-238 in North America following FDA approval. Genentech
    also has the option to expand the agreement to a global
    agreement. The agreement, in general terms, provides that
    Genentech will assume full responsibility for the development,
    manufacture and commercialization of ALTU-238.

    Pursuant to the agreement, Genentech agreed to make specific
    cash payments to us, including an up-front payment of
    $30&#160;million, which consists of $15&#160;million in
    non-refundable license fee payments and $15&#160;million in
    exchange for 794,575&#160;shares of common stock. Genentech also
    agreed to make cash payments to us based on the achievement of
    performance milestones during the clinical development,
    regulatory approval and commercialization process in the
    aggregate of approximately $148&#160;million, and to reimburse
    us for various development, manufacturing, regulatory, and
    commercialization activities that we perform on Genentech&#146;s
    behalf. If Genentech exercises its global option, it may be
    required to pay us an additional $110&#160;million in upfront
    payments and milestones. In addition, Genentech will pay us

    We have completed our Phase&#160;II clinical trial of the
    capsule form of ALTU-135 and are designing and preparing for our
    Phase&#160;III clinical trial and the long-term safety study,
    which we expect will begin in the second quarter of 2007, and
    conducting related development activities. Our current estimate
    of the total costs we will incur to complete the development of
    ALTU-135 and file an NDA with the FDA is approximately
    $137.5&#160;million, excluding non-cash compensation expense and
    depreciation. We revised this estimate during the third quarter
    of 2006 from a previous estimate of $118.0&#160;million, due to
    changes in specific assumptions related to the cost of
    manufacturing and the conduct of the Phase&#160;III clinical
    trials. The possibility exists that we may revise this estimate
    in the future. As of December&#160;31, 2006, we had incurred
    approximately $69.8&#160;million of these total costs. We have
    also completed a Phase&#160;II clinical trial of ALTU-238. From
    January&#160;1, 2003, the date on which we began separately
    tracking development costs for ALTU-238, through
    December&#160;31, 2006, we incurred approximately
    $26.6&#160;million in total development costs for this product
    candidate. The amount of resources we devote to ALTU-238 in the
    future is subject to Genentech&#146;s development plan and
    whether Genentech exercises its option to extend our agreement
    globally. The parties may agree to have Altus conduct certain
    efforts that would be subject to reimbursement by Genentech. We
    expect to file an IND for ALTU-237 in the first half of 2007.
    Through December&#160;31, 2006, we have incurred approximately
    $6.8&#160;million in total development costs for this
    pre-clinical product candidate. We expect our research and
    development costs to increase substantially in the foreseeable
    future as we move ALTU-135 into Phase&#160;III trials, file an
    IND and initiate clinical trials for ALTU-237 and continue the
    development of our pre-clinical pipeline.

    Product candidates in clinical development have higher
    associated development costs than those in the preclinical stage

    Phase&#160;I to Phase&#160;II or Phase&#160;II to

    Collaborative agreements are often multiple element
    arrangements, providing for a license as well as research and

    We recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery
    of the license only if the license has standalone value and the
    fair value of the undelivered performance obligations under the
    collaborative agreement can be determined. If the fair value of
    the undelivered performance obligations can be determined, such
    obligations would then be accounted for separately. If the
    license is considered to either (1)&#160;not have standalone
    value or (2)&#160;have standalone value but the fair value of
    any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be
    determined, the arrangement would then be accounted for as a

    When we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as

    We use an input based measure, specifically direct costs, to
    determine proportional performance, because, for our current
    agreements, we believe the use of an input based measure is a
    more accurate reflection of the level of effort related to our
    research and development collaborations than an output based
    measure, such as milestones. The impact of fluctuation in
    exchange rates under collaborative agreements that are
    denominated in a foreign currency is reflected in deferred
    revenue at the time cash is received and in revenue at each
    reporting period.

    Under the proportional performance method, periodic revenue
    related to upfront license payments is recognized as the
    percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total
    effort budgeted for all of our performance obligations under the
    arrangement. Significant management judgment is required in
    determining the level of effort required under an arrangement
    and the period over which we expect to complete the related
    performance obligations. These estimates include the period of
    development, the size and complexity of the clinical trials and
    the cost and availability of clinical supplies. We review our
    estimates quarterly, and may change our estimates in the future,
    resulting in a change in the amount of cumulative revenue
    recognized as of the date of the change in estimate. Since the
    inception of our collaboration agreements with CFFTI and
    Dr.&#160;Falk, we have adjusted our estimated costs to complete
    the development program for ALTU-135 on four occasions,
    including during the third quarters of 2005 and 2006, resulting
    in cumulative changes in our revenue at each time of the change
    in the estimate. During the third quarter of 2005, we reduced
    our estimated development costs for ALTU-135, which resulted in
    a $3.3&#160;million increase in our cumulative revenue in the
    third quarter of 2005. During the third quarter of 2006, we
    increased our estimated development costs for ALTU-135, which
    resulted in a $3.7&#160;million decrease in our cumulative
    revenue in the third quarter of 2006. The possibility exists
    that revenue may increase or decrease in future periods as
    estimated costs of the underlying program increase or decrease
    or as exchange rates impact the value of foreign currency
    denominated collaborations, without additional cash inflows from
    the collaborative partner or non-government institution. For
    example, as of December&#160;31, 2006, if our estimated total
    development costs for ALTU-135 were to increase by 10%, it would
    result in a $2.0&#160;million reduction of cumulative revenue.
    If our estimated total development costs for ALTU-135 were to
    decrease by 10%, it would result in a $2.4&#160;million increase
    in cumulative revenue.

    We account for transactions in which goods and services are
    received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair
    value of such goods and services received or the deemed fair
    value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more
    reliably measured. The fair value is recorded as stock-based
    compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. When
    equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the
    receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or
    services can not be readily estimated, as is true in connection
    with most stock options and warrants granted to employees,
    directors, consultants and other non-employees, we determine the
    fair value of the equity instruments using all relevant
    information, including application of the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model and, in specified situations, input from
    valuation specialists, all of which require various estimates
    and assumptions. Different estimates and assumptions can yield
    materially different results. The factors which most affect
    charges or credits to operations related to stock-based
    compensation include: the deemed fair value of the common stock
    underlying the equity instruments for which stock-based
    compensation is recorded; the volatility of such deemed fair
    value; the estimated life of the equity instrument; and the

    entitled <I>Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity
    Securities Issued as Compensation.</I> We used two primary
    valuation methodologies within the market approach in the

    comparable company IPO analysis, and a Guideline Transactions
    Analysis, or comparable company M&#38;A analysis, to determine
    the estimated deemed fair market value of our equity during the
    period discussed above. We then allocated value between the
    preferred stock and the common stock under each analysis and
    arrived at the value of the common stock based on a
    probability-weighted expected return methodology. Now that our
    common stock is publicly traded, we will use the value of that

    <I>Income Taxes.</I>&#160;&#160;As part of the process of
    preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required
    to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in
    which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual
    current tax exposure together with assessing temporary
    differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax
    and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred
    tax assets and liabilities. As of December&#160;31, 2006, we had
    federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of
    $129.9&#160;million, which expire starting in 2020, federal
    research and development credit carryforwards of
    $0.8&#160;million and total net deferred tax assets of
    $55.7&#160;million. We have recorded a valuation allowance of
    $55.7&#160;million as an offset against these otherwise
    recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty
    surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit. In
    the event that we determine in the future that we will be able
    to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset, an
    adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would create
    an income tax benefit in the period in which such a
    determination is made. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains
    provisions that may limit the utilization of net operating loss
    carryforwards and credits available to be used in any given year
    in the event of a change in ownership. Given our change in
    ownership as a result of the initial public offering, our
    utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.

    <I>2006 as compared to 2005.</I>&#160;&#160;Research and
    development expense for 2006 increased due primarily to an
    increase in third-party development costs relating to ALTU-135,
    ALTU-238 and our pre-clinical product candidates, increased
    non-cash compensation expense and an increase in personnel.
    During 2006, we incurred $6.4&#160;million in costs related to
    payments made to Lonza to purchase equipment to establish its
    manufacturing facility and
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">start-up</FONT>
    costs paid to Lonza for the manufacture of the commercial supply
    of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API&#146;s, in
    ALTU-135. Other ALTU-135 costs for the period related to the
    manufacturing of materials for planned toxicity and
    Phase&#160;III studies, including increased formulation and
    process development work for ALTU-135, as well as activities
    relating to a technical transfer to Amano of processes related
    to the manufacture of the APIs in ALTU-135. ALTU-238 costs
    during 2006 related to: (1)&#160;the completion of a
    Phase&#160;II clinical trial in growth hormone deficient adults;
    (2)&#160;the purchase of materials for ongoing process
    development and formulation activities related to our planned
    Phase&#160;III clinical trials in adults and Phase&#160;II and
    Phase&#160;III clinical trials in pediatric patients;
    (3)&#160;facility modification costs, technology transfer costs
    and validation costs relating to our clinical supply agreement
    with Althea for ALTU-238; and (4)&#160;Phase&#160;III-related
    toxicology studies. In addition, we incurred increased
    pre-clinical costs in 2006 primarily related to ALTU-237. Prior
    to 2006, we did not separately track costs relating to ALTU-237.
    To support this increased level of activity, our research and
    development headcount increased to 103&#160;full-time employees
    at December&#160;31, 2006 from 78&#160;full-time employees at
    December&#160;31, 2005.

    research and development costs will continue to increase in
    coming periods as ALTU-135 progresses into Phase&#160;III
    clinical trials, ALTU-237 begins Phase&#160;I trials and as our
    pre-clinical product candidates advance in our pipeline. The
    amount of resources we will devote to ALTU-238 in the future is
    subject to Genentech&#146;s development plan and whether
    Genentech exercises its option to extend our agreement globally.
    The parties may agree to have Altus conduct certain efforts that
    would be subject to reimbursement by Genentech.

    <I>2006 as compared to 2005.</I>&#160;&#160;General, sales and
    administrative expenses for the year ended December&#160;31,
    2006 increased from the prior year primarily due to increased
    costs associated with being a public company and an increase in
    marketing costs as we build our marketing infrastructure as our
    product candidates,
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">ALTU-135</FONT> and
    ALTU-238, advance through clinical trials. As a result of
    completing our initial public offering in January 2006, our
    legal costs, general insurance costs and consulting and
    professional service costs have increased by $2.3&#160;million.
    In addition, our stock based compensation expense for 2006
    increased by $1.1&#160;million as we added personnel into the
    general, sales and administrative group as well as changed our
    assumptions used to value stock options under SFAS&#160;123(R).
    We expect that general, sales and administrative expenses will
    continue to increase in the future due to increased payroll,
    expanded infrastructure, increased consulting, legal, accounting
    and investor relations expenses associated with being a public
    company and costs incurred to seek collaborations with respect
    to our product candidates.

    administrative expenses for the year ended December&#160;31,
    2005 increased from the prior year primarily due to increased
    personnel costs, legal costs and marketing costs, as well as an
    increase in stock based compensation. During 2005, we continued
    to grow our general, sales and administrative departments and
    granted an increased number of stock options during 2005 as
    compared to 2004 as part of the growth. In addition, in light of
    our then contemplated initial public offering, we performed a
    retrospective analysis of the fair value of our common stock to
    determine the deemed fair market value of our common stock for
    accounting purposes which resulted in additional stock based
    compensation expense being recognized during 2005. This
    retrospective analysis did not affect 2004 expense.

    We have financed our operations since inception primarily

    collaborators, borrowings and capital lease financings and,
    prior to the middle of 2004, revenue from product sales. On
    January&#160;31, 2006, we completed our initial public offering
    of 8,050,000&#160;shares of common stock at a price of
    $15.00&#160;per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of

    From September 2001 until the time of the initial public
    offering, we funded our activities primarily with issuances of

    approximately $50.4&#160;million from the issuance of
    Series&#160;C convertible preferred stock. In September and
    December 2001, we received approximately $46.2&#160;million from
    the issuance of Series&#160;B convertible preferred stock. Prior
    to September 2001, we received most of our equity and debt
    financing proceeds from the issuance of notes, common stock and
    preferred stock to Vertex, including redeemable preferred stock
    and Series&#160;A convertible preferred stock. The
    Series&#160;A, B and C convertible preferred stock were
    converted into shares of common stock upon the closing of the
    initial public offering, and accrued but unpaid dividends were
    satisfied through issuance of shares of our common stock upon
    the closing of the offering at the offering price. The

    In December 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
    Genentech for the development, manufacture and commercialization
    of ALTU-238 in North America. Pursuant to the agreement,
    Genentech will make a $15&#160;million upfront payment, with the
    potential for us to receive additional payments of approximately
    $148&#160;million based upon the successful completion of
    development and commercialization milestones. In conjunction
    with this agreement, we have received $15&#160;million from the
    sale of 794,575&#160;shares of our common stock to Genentech. In
    addition, if Genentech exercises its global option, we could
    potentially receive additional payments of more than
    $110&#160;million, comprised of additional upfront and milestone
    payments. Upon any commercialization, we will receive royalties
    on net sales of ALTU-238. The amount of resources we devote to
    ALTU-238 in the future is subject to Genentech&#146;s
    development plan and whether Genentech exercises its option to
    extend our agreement globally. The parties may agree to have
    Altus conduct certain efforts that would be subject to
    reimbursement by Genentech.

    At December&#160;31, 2006, we had $85.9&#160;million in cash,
    cash equivalents and marketable securities. The composition and
    mix of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may

    conditions in the financial markets, the maturity of specific
    investments, and our near term liquidity needs. Our funds at

    Since our inception, we have generated significant losses while
    we have advanced our product candidates into preclinical and
    clinical trials. Accordingly, we have historically used cash in
    our operating activities. During the years ended
    December&#160;31, 2006 and 2005, our operating activities used
    $54.1&#160;million and $20.3&#160;million of cash and cash
    equivalents. The use of cash in each period was primarily a
    result of expenditures associated with our research and
    development activities and amounts incurred to develop and
    maintain our administrative infrastructure, offset partially in
    2005 by milestone payments received from our collaborators.

    We have generally financed a substantial portion of our capital
    expenditures through equipment loans under which the lender
    retains a security interest in the equipment. The capital
    equipment loans are governed by a master loan and security
    agreement that contains the key terms of the loans. The master
    loan and security agreement require us to maintain insurance on
    the collateral. Each loan carries a fixed rate of interest which
    was established at the time of borrowing and is payable in fixed
    monthly installments over periods of up to four years. We intend
    to secure additional equipment loans to continue to finance a
    substantial portion of our future capital expenditures.

    Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are
    invested with highly-rated financial institutions in North
    America with the primary objective of preservation of principal,
    while maintaining liquidity and generating favorable yields.
    When purchased, investments have a maturity of less than
    18&#160;months. Some of the securities we invest in are subject
    to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market
    interest rates increase. To minimize the risk associated with
    changing interest rates, we invest primarily in bank
    certificates of deposit, United States government securities and
    investment-grade commercial paper and corporate notes.
    Substantially all of our investments at December&#160;31, 2006
    met these criteria. At December&#160;31, 2006, we had gross
    unrealized gains of approximately $25,000 on our investments. If
    market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly
    by 10% from levels at December&#160;31, 2006, we estimate that
    the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an
    immaterial amount.

    Our total debt at December&#160;31, 2006 was $5.0&#160;million,
    primarily representing drawdowns under our lease credit
    facilities and expired capital equipment facilities. All
    borrowings under these credit facilities carried fixed rates of
    interest established at the time such drawdowns were made.
    Accordingly, our future interest costs relating to such
    drawdowns are not subject to fluctuations in market interest
    rates.

    Our assets are principally located in the United States and
    substantially all of our historical revenues and operating
    expenses are denominated in United States dollars. Contract
    revenue under our collaboration with Dr.&#160;Falk and some of
    our purchases of raw materials are denominated in Euros.
    Accordingly, we are subject to market risk with respect to
    foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses. We had
    foreign currency exchange losses of $0.3&#160;million in 2005.
    There were no foreign currency gains or losses in 2006. If the
    average Euro/ United States dollar exchange rate were to
    strengthen or weaken by 10% against the average respective
    exchange rates experienced in 2006 or 2005, we estimate that the
    impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows would not be material. Since ALTU-135 has not reached
    commercialization in North America or in the territory covered
    by the Dr.&#160;Falk agreement, we do not believe we are subject
    to significant foreign currency risk at this time. We may engage
    in additional collaborations with international partners. When
    ALTU-135 or any other future drug candidates reach
    commercialization outside of the United&#160;States, if at all,
    or we enter into additional collaborations with international
    partners providing for foreign currency-denominated revenues and
    expenses, we may be subject to significant market risk.

    performance objectives, and to align executives&#146; incentives
    with stockholder value creation. To achieve these objectives,
    the Compensation Committee has maintained a compensation plan
    that ties a substantial portion of executives&#146; overall
    compensation to our research, clinical, regulatory, commercial,
    and operational performance. Because we believe the performance
    of every employee is important to our success, we are mindful of
    the effect our executive compensation and incentive programs
    have on all of our employees. In 2006, we began working on a
    revised compensation structure that is more reflective of our
    needs as a public company. We anticipate completing this work
    and implementing a new structure in 2007. Compensation decisions
    for fiscal year 2006 were determined by using the policies and
    processes in place prior to our initial public offering and are
    detailed below.

    Through fiscal year 2006, management has developed our
    compensation plans by utilizing publicly available compensation
    data and subscription compensation survey data for national and
    regional companies in the biotechnology industry, in particular
    data obtained from Radford Biotechnology Surveys, prepared by
    AON Consulting, Inc. We believe these data provide us with
    appropriate compensation benchmarks, because these companies
    have similar organizational structures and tend to compete with
    us for executives and other employees. For benchmarking
    executive compensation, we typically review the compensation
    data we have collected from the surveys, as well as various
    subsets of these data, to compare elements of compensation based
    on certain characteristics of the company, such as number of
    employees and number of shares of stock outstanding. Examples of
    companies we have used in evaluating our compensation components
    are Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc., CombinatoRx, Incorporated,
    and XenoPort, Inc.

    This collaborative annual review process begins in December of

    self-evaluation which is reviewed by the appropriate department
    manager who submits their team merit recommendations to the

    comprised of our President and Chief and Executive Officer,
    Chief Financial Officer, and Director of Human Resources. That
    group reviews the submissions by each department and prepares a
    final set of recommendations for submission to our Compensation

    Following his review of our executive officers, our President
    and Chief Executive Officer prepares compensation
    recommendations for our executive officers which are reviewed
    and finalized with our Director of Human Resources and submitted

    supporting the recommendations. The Compensation Committee may
    accept or adjust the recommendations. After the Compensation
    Committee approves the recommendations, managers then meet with

    average. For example, the average performance increase for 2006
    for comparable companies based on the Radford data was 4%. Using
    that average, we established a distribution in which, depending
    on the level of performance, employees received a lower or
    higher percentage merit salary increase for fiscal year 2007.
    These merit increase values are designed to delineate the
    various levels of performance in order to recognize and reward
    the high performing employees. To achieve this goal, certain
    ratings are assigned absolute values while others are assigned
    ranges to allow for varying degrees of performance within these
    categories.

    Our practice has been to provide employees in senior management
    level positions with the opportunity to earn an annual cash
    bonus up to a certain percentage of their annual base salary.
    The target percentages for these bonuses range from 10% for
    senior managers below the vice president level, 20% to 35% for
    vice presidents, 40% for senior vice presidents, and 50% for the
    president and chief executive officer. These target percentages
    are generally set forth in the employee&#146;s offer letter and
    are subject to adjustment in the discretion of the Compensation
    Committee. This practice is designed to enable us to attract
    senior level employees and add an additional compensation
    opportunity in the form of variable pay. As part of the annual
    review process, performance of each eligible employee is
    evaluated against the objectives that were mutually established
    by the employees and their managers. A determination is made as
    to the percent of the bonus to be awarded. Bonus awards for
    these employees are determined by the Compensation Committee
    based on overall corporate performance together with a
    subjective assessment by their manager of each employee&#146;s
    achievement of the previously established performance goals
    which relate to the employee&#146;s area of responsibility.
    Bonus awards are generally prorated for individuals who joined
    the company during the applicable year.

    In 2006, we hired five additional management level team members
    who have brought significant experience and expertise to the
    company, including two of our executive officers named in the

    We believe that long-term performance is achieved through an
    ownership culture that encourages long-term participation by our
    executive officers in equity-based awards, in the form of stock
    options. Our Amended and Restated 2002 Employee, Director and
    Consultant Stock Plan, as amended, or our 2002 Stock Plan,
    allows the grant to executive officers of stock options,
    restricted stock, and other equity-based awards. To date, we
    have only granted stock options but we may consider the
    possibility of granting other types of equity awards as our
    business strategy evolves. We typically make an initial stock
    option award to new employees and performance-based awards as
    part of our overall compensation program as well as option
    grants to reflect promotions, as necessary. We have not adopted
    stock ownership guidelines. As we mature as a company and our
    risk profile is reduced, the Compensation Committee has
    implemented a policy of ensuring that management limits equity
    awards to reflect the greater value represented by each share of
    an equity award.

    Executives who join us are awarded initial stock option grants.
    These grants have an exercise price equal to the closing price
    of our common stock on the date of grant, which is generally the
    first day of the officer&#146;s employment, and a four-year
    vesting schedule with 1/16th&#160;of the shares vesting on the
    last day of each successive three-month period following the
    date of grant. The amount of the initial stock option award is
    determined based on the executive&#146;s position with us and
    analysis of the competitive practices of the companies similar
    in size to us represented in the compensation data that we
    review with the goal of creating a total compensation package
    for new employees that is competitive with other biotechnology
    companies and that will enable us to attract high quality

    Committee believes that stock options provide management with a
    strong link to long-term corporate performance and the creation
    of stockholder value. We intend that the annual aggregate value
    of these awards will be set near competitive median levels for
    companies represented in the compensation data we review. The
    size of the pool of options or equity awards is also intended to
    be limited to the actual number of shares added to the option
    plan each year under a pre-defined, stockholder approved
    formula. The formula adds a number of shares to the option plan
    equal to 3% of our fully diluted outstanding shares and
    establishes a budget for option awards that the Compensation
    Committee uses to help assure that employee ownership is
    balanced with the interests of our stockholders. As is the case
    when the amounts of base salary and initial option awards are
    determined, a review of all components of the executive&#146;s
    compensation is conducted when determining annual option awards
    to ensure that an executive&#146;s total compensation conforms
    to our overall philosophy and objectives. A pool of options is
    reserved for executives and non-executives based on setting a
    target grant level for each employee category, with the higher
    ranked employees being eligible for a higher target grant.
    Annual performance option grants are prorated for employees who
    were employed for only part of the fiscal year.

    In determining stock option grants for 2006 performance, which
    were approved by our Compensation Committee in March 2007, we
    used the 2006 Radford Biotechnology Survey&#160;&#151; Stock
    Options as a Percent of Outstanding Shares&#160;Report as our
    starting point. This report contains data on option grants for
    each position at small publicly traded biotechnology companies,
    defined as those with less than 30&#160;million shares
    outstanding; medium publicly traded biotechnology companies,
    defined as those with 30 to 99&#160;million shares outstanding;
    and large publicly traded biotechnology companies, defined as
    those with 100&#160;million or more shares outstanding.
    Performance grants are based on the median grant levels given
    for each position by the companies surveyed which are based on a
    percentage of shares outstanding. This report however, includes
    companies that vary in size, have different number of employees,
    have different organizational structures, have a more
    established option philosophy, and multiple incumbents in a
    particular job code or position which can impact the weights
    assigned to each position. Because such variances can have an
    impact on the weight assigned to the roles within these
    companies, as additional analysis, we developed a customized
    report from the Radford report where we identified a subset of
    companies most similar to ours. In this customized report, we
    included companies with less than 500 employees and that had
    less than 30&#160;million shares outstanding. We believe the
    results of the customized report were a better benchmark for
    determining performance option grants for 2006 because it
    enabled us to base our recommendations to the Compensation
    Committee on companies that most closely resemble us.

    If an employee receives a promotion during the year, at the time

    Pursuant to our stock option agreements with our executive
    officers, in the event of a change in control, as defined in our
    2002 Stock Plan, the vesting of outstanding stock option awards
    held by these executive officers will accelerate if the
    executive officer is terminated for certain reasons after a
    change in control, which we refer to as &#147;double
    trigger&#148; acceleration. See &#147;&#151;&#160;Potential
    Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control&#160;&#151;
    Termination of Employment and Change in Control
    Arrangements&#160;&#151; Change in Control Arrangements Under
    Our 2002 Stock Plan&#148; below for a detailed discussion of
    these provisions. We believe a &#147;double trigger&#148;
    requirement maximizes stockholder value because it prevents an
    unintended windfall to management in the event of a friendly, or
    non-hostile, change in control. Under this structure, unvested
    option awards under our 2002 Stock Plan would continue to
    provide our executives with the incentive to remain with the
    company after a friendly change in control. If, by contrast, our
    2002 Stock Plan had only a &#147;single trigger,&#148; and if a
    friendly change in control occurred, management&#146;s option
    awards would all vest immediately, creating a windfall, and the
    buyer would then likely find it necessary to replace the
    compensation with new unvested equity awards in order to retain
    management. This rationale is why we believe a
    &#147;double-trigger&#148; equity vesting acceleration mechanism
    is more stockholder-friendly, and thus more appropriate for our
    company, than a &#147;single trigger&#148; acceleration
    mechanism.

    The Compensation Committee recognizes that executives,
    especially highly ranked executives, often face challenges
    securing new employment following termination. In March 2007,
    the Compensation Committee approved severance and change in
    control arrangements with each of our executive officers and
    authorized us to enter into agreements with our executive
    officers reflecting the approved terms. The Compensation
    Committee approved placing the executive officers into three
    categories, based on level of responsibility and seniority, and
    approved a corresponding set of severance and change in control
    arrangements for each category, which are detailed below under
    &#147;&#151;&#160;Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change
    in Control&#160;&#151; Severance and Change in Control
    Arrangements Approved in Fiscal Year 2007&#148;. One category is
    comprised solely of our President and Chief Executive Officer,
    Mr.&#160;Berkle, a second category includes Mr.&#160;Lieber and
    Drs.&#160;Blank and Margolin, and the third category includes
    Ms.&#160;Sabella. As a public company, we have continued to
    review the practices of companies similar to us in the
    compensation data we obtained and we believe that the approved
    terms of Mr.&#160;Berkle&#146;s severance and change in control
    arrangement, and those of our other executive officers, are
    generally in line with severance packages offered to chief
    executive officers and other executive officers of the public
    companies of similar size to us represented in the compensation
    data we reviewed.

    We entered into an employment agreement with Sheldon Berkle, our
    President and Chief Executive Officer, in May 2005.
    Mr.&#160;Berkle&#146;s annual base salary is currently $434,660.
    Pursuant to the agreement, Mr.&#160;Berkle has the opportunity
    to earn an annual performance bonus of up to 50% of his salary,
    based on achievement of a series of personal and corporate
    objectives that our Board of Directors and Mr.&#160;Berkle
    define annually, and is also eligible to receive annual stock
    option grants based on our corporate performance.
    Mr.&#160;Berkle also received a signing bonus of $153,500. Such
    bonus replaced a loan from us to Mr.&#160;Berkle in the amount
    of $150,000 at the commencement of his employment, which loan
    was repaid prior to the filing of the registration statement
    relating to our initial public offering. He will be required to
    repay $75,000 of the bonus amount in the event that he
    voluntarily terminates his employment or is terminated for cause
    before May&#160;9, 2007, less the amount of taxes he incurred in
    connection with his receipt of such portion of the bonus. Upon
    appointment as our President and Chief Executive Officer and as
    provided in the employment agreement, Mr.&#160;Berkle received
    options to purchase 566,943&#160;shares of our common stock at
    an exercise price of $3.92&#160;per share. One quarter of the
    options vested on the first anniversary of his employment, with
    the balance vesting monthly for three additional years. Of the
    566,943 options, 490,434 were immediately exercisable for shares
    of restricted stock, subject to a repurchase right by us that
    lapses based on the same vesting schedule as the options. As a
    condition of employment, Mr.&#160;Berkle has entered into a
    non-competition/non-solicitation agreement pursuant to which he
    has agreed not to compete with us for a period of 12&#160;months
    after the termination of his employment. Mr.&#160;Berkle&#146;s
    employment agreement does not have a defined term.

    As discussed above in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis,
    in March 2007, the Compensation Committee approved severance and
    change in control arrangements with our executive officers, and
    authorized us to enter into severance and change in control
    agreements with our executive officers reflecting the approved
    terms. The execution of each severance and change in control
    agreement is contingent on the executive officer executing a
    non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disclosure and assignment
    of inventions agreement pursuant to which he or she will agree
    not to compete with us for the applicable severance period
    following termination. Receipt of any benefits at the time of
    termination will be further conditioned on the executive officer
    executing a written release of us from any and all claims
    arising in connection with his or her employment.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
    have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
    control over financial reporting. Our audits included
    consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
    basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
    financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
    audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present

    Contract revenue includes revenue from collaborative license and
    development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical
    companies for the development and commercialization of the
    Company&#146;s product candidates. The terms of the agreements
    typically include non-refundable license fees, funding of
    research and development, payments based upon achievement of
    clinical development and commercial milestones and royalties on
    product sales. Contract revenue also includes non-refundable
    research and development funding under collaborative agreements
    with corporate partners and grants from various non-government
    institutions. Research and development funding generally
    reimburses the Company for a portion or all of the costs of
    development and testing related to the collaborative research
    programs or grants.

    Collaborative agreements are often multiple element
    arrangements, providing for a license as well as research and
    development services. The Company analyzes agreements with
    multiple element arrangements to determine whether the
    deliverables under the agreement, including research and
    development services, can be separated or whether all of the
    deliverables must be accounted for as a single unit of
    accounting in accordance with EITF
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">00-21.</FONT> The
    Company recognizes upfront license payments as revenue upon
    delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value
    and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations
    can be determined. If the fair value of the undelivered
    performance obligations under the collaborative agreement can be
    determined, such obligations would then be accounted for
    separately. If the license is considered to either (i)&#160;not
    have standalone value or (ii)&#160;have standalone value but the
    fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations
    cannot be determined, the arrangement would then be accounted

    When the Company determines that an arrangement should be
    accounted for as a single unit of accounting, the Company must
    determine the period during which the performance obligations
    will be performed and the revenue related to payments will be
    recognized. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative
    amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue
    earned as of the period ending date.

    The Company recognizes revenue using the proportional
    performance method provided that it can reasonably estimate the
    level of effort required to complete its performance obligations
    under an arrangement and such performance obligations are
    provided on a best-efforts basis. The Company uses an input
    based measure, specifically direct costs, to determine
    proportional performance, because, for the Company&#146;s
    current agreements, the Company believes the use of an input
    based measure most closely reflects the level of effort related
    to its research and development collaborations rather than an
    output based measure, such as milestones. The impact of
    fluctuation in exchange rates under collaborative agreements
    that are denominated in a foreign currency is reflected in
    deferred revenue at the time cash is received and in revenue at
    each reporting period.

    Under the proportional performance method, periodic revenue
    related to upfront license payments is recognized as the
    percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total
    effort budgeted for all of the Company&#146;s performance
    obligations under the arrangement. Significant management
    judgment is required in determining the level of effort required
    under an arrangement and the period over which the Company
    expects to complete the related performance obligations.
    Estimates may change in the future, resulting in a change in the
    amount of cumulative revenue recognized as of the date of the
    change in estimate. Since the inception of the Company&#146;s
    collaboration agreements with CFFTI and Dr.&#160;Falk, the
    Company has adjusted its estimated costs to complete the
    development program for ALTU-135 on four occasions, including
    during the third quarters of 2005 and 2006, resulting in
    cumulative changes in its revenue at each time of the change in
    the estimate. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company
    reduced its estimated development costs for
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">ALTU-135,</FONT>
    which resulted in a $3,313 increase in its cumulative revenue in
    the third quarter of 2005. During the third quarter of 2006, the
    Company increased its estimated development costs for ALTU-135,
    which resulted in a $3,684 decrease in its cumulative revenue in
    the third quarter of 2006. The possibility exists that revenue
    may increase or decrease in future periods as estimated costs of
    the underlying program increase or decrease or as exchange rates
    impact the value of foreign currency denominated collaborations,
    without additional cash inflows from the collaborative partner
    or non-government institution.

    examination by the appropriate taxing authority. If a tax
    position meets the &#147;more likely than not&#148; recognition
    criteria, FIN&#160;48 requires the tax position be measured at
    the largest amount of benefit greater than 50&#160;percent

    <I>Fair Value Measurements</I> (&#147;SFAS&#160;157&#148;),

    <I>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc.</I>&#160;&#151;
    In February 2001, Altus entered into a strategic alliance
    agreement with CFFTI to collaborate on the development of
    ALTU-135 and specified derivatives of
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">ALTU-135</FONT> in
    North America for the treatment of malabsorption due to exocrine
    pancreatic insufficiency in patients with cystic fibrosis and
    other indications. The agreement, in general terms, provides the
    Company with funding from CFFTI for a portion of the development
    costs of ALTU-135 upon the achievement of specified development
    milestones, up to a total of $25,000, in return for specified
    payment obligations and our obligation to use good faith
    reasonable efforts to develop and bring ALTU-135 to market in
    North America. As of December&#160;31, 2006, the Company had
    received a total of $18,400 of the $25,000 available under the
    CFFTI agreement and recognized cumulative revenue of $11,801.
    Under the terms of the agreement, the Company may receive an
    additional milestone payment of $6,600, less an amount
    determined by when the Company achieves the milestone. Revenue
    from CFFTI accounted for 45%, 49% and 43% of Altus&#146; total
    revenue in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

    If Altus is successful in obtaining FDA approval of ALTU-135, it
    will be required to pay CFFTI a license fee equal to the
    aggregate amount of milestone payments it has received from
    CFFTI, plus interest, up to a maximum of $40,000, less the fair
    market value of the shares of stock underlying the warrants
    Altus issued to CFFTI. This fee, plus interest on the unpaid
    balance, will be due in four annual installments, commencing
    30&#160;days after the approval date. In addition, Altus is
    obligated to pay royalties to CFFTI consisting of a percentage
    of worldwide net sales by it or its sublicenses of ALTU-135 for
    any and all indications until the expiration of specified United
    States patents covering ALTU-135. Altus has the option to
    terminate its ongoing royalty obligation by making a one-time
    payment to CFFTI, but it does not expect to do so. Under the
    agreement, CFFTI has also agreed to provide the Company with
    reasonable access to its network of medical providers, patients,
    researchers and others involved in the care and treatment of
    cystic fibrosis patients, and to use reasonable efforts to

    In connection with the execution of this agreement and the first
    amendment of the agreement, Altus issued to CFFTI warrants to
    purchase a total of 261,664&#160;shares of its common stock at
    an exercise price of $0.02&#160;per share, including 174,443
    warrants with a fair value of $1,748 issued upon execution of
    the agreement in February 2001. The fair value of the 174,443
    warrants is being recognized as a discount to contract revenue
    and amortized against the gross revenue earned under the
    contract. The remaining 87,221 warrants were issued in
    connection with the Series&#160;B Redeemable Convertible
    Preferred Stock financing.

    In December 2003, the Company and CFFTI amended the agreement
    again to provide the Company with an interest-bearing advance
    against a future milestone. This $1,500 advance was paid to the
    Company in January 2004 and is included in long-term deferred
    revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The advance,
    including interest at an annual rate of 15%, will be deducted
    from the milestone at the time the milestone is earned. In
    addition to the amounts deducted from the future milestone, and
    in the event ALTU-135 is approved, the Company will pay to CFFTI
    an amount equal to the advance in addition to the amounts
    otherwise owed to CFFTI. If the milestone is not achieved or
    ALTU-135 is not approved, the Company has no obligation to CFFTI
    as a result of this amendment.

    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Hart-Scott-Rodino</FONT>

    terms of the agreement, Altus granted Genentech exclusive rights
    and license to make (and have made), use and import ALTU-238,
    and to sell ALTU-238 in North America if approved by the FDA.
    Genentech was also given the option to expand the agreement to a

    Pursuant to the agreement, Genentech agreed to make specific
    cash payments, including an up-front payment of $30,000, which
    consists of $15,000 in non-refundable license fee payments and
    $15,000 in exchange for 794,575&#160;shares of Altus common
    stock. Genentech also agreed to make cash payments based on the
    achievement of various performance milestones during the
    clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization
    process of approximately $148,000, and to reimburse the Company
    for various development activities performed by Altus on

    option, it may be required to pay an additional $110,000 in
    upfront payments and milestones. In addition, Genentech will pay

    In connection with the execution of the Company&#146;s strategic
    alliance with CFFTI in 2001 (see Note&#160;4), the Company
    issued CFFTI fully vested warrants to purchase
    174,443&#160;shares of common stock at an exercise price of
    $0.02&#160;per share. The fair value of the warrants on the date
    of grant was $1,748. The Company determined the value of the
    warrants with the assistance of valuation specialists. The
    warrants are being accounted for as a discount to contract
    revenue and amortized against the gross revenue earned under the
    contract. The net carrying amount of the warrants was
    approximately $861 and $1,032 as of December&#160;31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Warrant amortization totaled $171, $292, and
    $135 during the years ended December&#160;31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

    <I>Equipment Loans</I>&#160;&#151; During 2003, the Company
    borrowed approximately $1,128 from a lender through equipment
    loan expansion agreements under an existing 1999 master loan and
    security agreement. In May&#160;2004, the Company entered into a
    new master loan and security agreement with this lender and
    entered into a new equipment loan providing up to $6,901 of
    additional funding. The Company borrowed $2,642 and $3,899,
    under this equipment loan in 2005 and 2004, respectively. During
    2006, the Company entered into two additional equipment loans
    under the 2004 master loan and security agreement providing
    $1,310 of additional funding. At December&#160;31, 2006,
    outstanding borrowings under these equipment loans were $4,955.

    <I>Capital Leases</I>&#160;&#151; In April 2002, the Company
    entered into a capital lease agreement to lease up to $3,837 of
    general equipment for a period of four years. The total amount

    the fair market value of the equipment (and the book value) at
    the time of borrowings. The unused portion of the capital lease
    agreement expired in March 2003. At December&#160;31, 2006,
    outstanding borrowings under this capital lease agreement were

    The Company has established a full valuation reserve against the
    net deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the
    future recognition of these tax assets. The increase in the
    valuation allowance during the years ended December&#160;31,
    2006 and 2005 were $20,226 and $10,580, respectively. At
    December&#160;31, 2006, the Company has federal net operating
    loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carryforwards of approximately $129,871
    and tax credits of $788 and state NOLs of $131,484 and state tax
    credits of $783. The tax loss carryforwards of the Company and
    its subsidiary may be subject to limitation by Section&#160;382
    of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the amount
    utilizable each year. The amount of the limitation, if any, has
    not been quantified by the Company. The net operating loss
    carryforwards began to expire in 2006 for state purposes and
    begin to expire starting in 2020 for federal purposes.

    On January&#160;1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS&#160;No.&#160;123(R) as required, using the modified
    prospective transition method. The Company determines the fair
    value of equity instruments using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model and recognizes compensation cost ratably
    over the appropriate vesting period.

    Prior to January&#160;1, 2006, the Company had accounted for
    stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS&#160;123, which are similar to
    those in SFAS&#160;123(R), except that SFAS&#160;123 allowed
    forfeitures to be accounted for as they occur. Under the
    modified prospective transition method of SFAS&#160;123(R), the
    compensation expense relating to the unvested portion of
    previously granted awards at the adoption date is adjusted for
    estimated forfeitures, and the adjusted compensation expense is
    recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period.
    Pre-vesting forfeitures for all grants awarded after
    January&#160;1, 2006 and for the unvested portion of previously
    granted awards that were outstanding at the date of adoption of
    SFAS&#160;123(R) were estimated to be approximately
    2.5%&#160;per annum based on historical experience.

    The expected average option life assumption is based upon the
    simplified or &#147;plain-vanilla&#148; method, provided under
    SAB&#160;107 which averages the contractual term of the
    Company&#146;s options (10&#160;years) with the vesting term
    (4&#160;years) taking into consideration multiple vesting
    tranches. The Company is allowed to use the plain-vanilla method
    for all options granted prior to or on December&#160;31, 2007.
    Upon the Company&#146;s initial filing of its
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Form&#160;S-1</FONT>
    Registration Statement on October&#160;17, 2005, the Company
    began utilizing a volatility factor in valuing options granted
    to employees. To determine an appropriate volatility factor, the
    Company reviewed volatility factors being used by a group of
    peer companies, and selected a volatility factor consistent with
    those used by this group of peers. The Company has continued to
    utilize this methodology for the year ended December&#160;31,
    2006 due to the short length of time the Company&#146;s common
    stock has been publicly traded. Prior to October&#160;17, 2005,
    the Company had excluded a volatility factor, as permitted for
    private companies under the provisions of SFAS&#160;123.

    granted at less than the fair market value of the Company&#146;s
    common stock on the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options
    may be granted at an exercise price established by the Board of
    Directors at its sole discretion. Vesting periods are generally
    over a four year period and are determined by the Board of
    Directors or a delegated subcommittee or officer. Options and
    awards granted prior to January&#160;25, 2006 are generally
    exercisable immediately, but the shares purchased are subject to
    restriction on transfer until vested. At December&#160;31, 2006,
    the Company had no such shares outstanding. In the event of
    termination of an employee or the business relationship with a
    non-employee, the Company may repurchase all unvested shares
    from the optionee at the original issue price. Options granted
    under the 1993 and 2002 Plans expire no more than 10&#160;years
    from the date of grant.
