performance based and meets other conditions. Base salary does not qualify as performance-based compensation under Section&nbsp;162(m). As one of the factors in its consideration of compensation matters, the Compensation Committee considers the
anticipated tax treatment to the Company and to the executives of various payments and benefits. The deductibility of certain compensation payments depends upon the timing of an executive&#146;s vesting or exercise of previously granted options.
Interpretations and changes in the tax laws and other factors beyond the Compensation Committee&#146;s control also affect the deductibility of compensation. For these and other reasons, the Compensation Committee may not necessarily, or in all
circumstances, limit executive compensation to that which is deductible under Section&nbsp;162(m). As applicable, the Compensation Committee will consider various alternatives to preserving the deductibility of compensation payments and benefits to

STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On November&nbsp;5, 2003, the Company signed definitive documents to effect an investment in the Company by Deutsche Bank and Essar. In the transaction,
Deutsche Bank (&#147;DB&#148;) and Essar Global Limited (&#147;Essar&#148;) provided approximately equal portions of a $28.2 million investment in the Company in return for three-year secured promissory notes and warrants to purchase up to 80
percent of the Company&#146;s common stock. The Company accounted for the warrants and notes payable issued under the Deutsche Bank and Essar transaction in accordance with APB No.&nbsp;14, &#147;Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with
Stock Purchase Warrants&#148; (&#147;APB 14&#148;). Deutsche Bank and Essar had been issued initial and subsequent warrants to purchase 527,661,932 shares of common stock. APB 14 requires a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of debt
securities with detachable stock warrants to be allocated to the warrants and treated as paid-in capital. Any resulting discount or premium on the notes payable should be recorded and amortized over the life of the notes. The Company used the
Black-Scholes model to determine the value of the warrants issued to Deutsche Bank and Essar. Under the Black-Scholes model, the value of the warrants are determined by taking the difference between acquiring the stock outright and the present value
of paying the exercise price on the expiration day. As a result, the Company valued the initial warrants at $4.4 million. This amount was recorded as paid-in capital and the resulting discount on the notes payable was recorded and is being amortized
using the interest method over the life of the notes. As a result of making $10 million in principal payments on the Notes during the first quarter of 2004, the Company recognized $1.4 million in accelerated amortization of the discount on notes
payable during the period. On July&nbsp;13, 2004, Essar exercised all 264,358,628 of their warrants in exchange for one share of common stock per warrant. The total amount of consideration given was $2.6 million. These funds were used to reduce
outstanding debt under the new line of credit and make capital investments. On August&nbsp;20, 2004, Deutsche Bank exercised all 263,303,304 of their warrants in exchange for one share of common stock per warrant. The total amount of consideration
given was $2.6 million. These funds were used to reduce outstanding debt and make capital investments. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On December&nbsp;15, 2004, the
Company executed a Secured Promissory Note in favor of Essar Global Limited (&#147;Essar&#148;). The Secured Promissory Note was executed in favor of Essar as a result of DB&#146;s exercise of the Put and Call Agreement, pursuant to which DB has
sold to Essar 80% of the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Fourth Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note, dated November&nbsp;22, 2004, made by the Company in favor of DB (the &#147;DB Debt Put&#148;).&nbsp;The DB Debt Put was
calculated as of December&nbsp;15, 2004 to be $7,443 thousand, and this amount is the principal amount of the Secured Promissory Note.&nbsp;The Fourth Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note held by DB was cancelled concurrently with the
Company&#146;s execution of the Secured Promissory Note, and the balance of the outstanding principal and interest due to DB under that instrument, or $1,860 thousand was converted into a new Fifth Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note, dated
