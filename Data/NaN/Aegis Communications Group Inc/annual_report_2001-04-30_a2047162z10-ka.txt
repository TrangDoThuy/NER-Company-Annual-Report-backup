STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

    In the Questor transaction, the Questor Investors and a group of related
investment funds we refer to as the Thayer Investors signed a Stockholder's
Agreement. The Stockholders Agreement provides that the Thayer Investors and the
Questor Investors must satisfy a "right of first offer" to the other prior to a
transfer of its shares to a third party. The Stockholders Agreement also
provides that the Questor Investors and the Thayer Investors will provide each
other with certain "tag-along" rights in the event of a sale or transfer of
shares to a third party. The Thayer Investors and the Questor Investors are
required to use their best efforts to vote all of their shares to elect and
continue in office twelve directors, six of whom are nominated by the Questor
Investors and six of whom are nominated by Thayer.

    The Questor Investors have agreed that they will use their best efforts to
cause their Board designees to abstain from voting on any Board action in
connection with the optional redemption of the Preferred F Shares. Further, the
Thayer Investors have agreed that they will use their best efforts to cause
their Board designees to abstain from voting on any Board action in connection
with the repayment of the Promissory Note by and among IQI, Blank and the Blank
Trust dated April 16, 1998, in the original aggregate principal amount of
$1.0 million, and the Promissory Note by and between IQI and Thayer Equity dated
April 16, 1998, in the original principal amount of $2.0 million, or the
redemption or repurchase of any or all of either the Series D Preferred Stock or
the Series E Preferred Stock. Additionally, each committee of the Board will be
constituted so that the number of Questor Designees (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement) and Thayer Stockholder Designees (as defined

                                       5
<PAGE>
in the Stockholders' Agreement) on any such committee is as nearly as possible
in the same proportion as the number of Questor Designees and Thayer Stockholder
Designees on the entire Board.

    The Stockholders Agreement and the Bylaws also provide that certain major
decisions will require the affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths of
the directors of the Board. Those decisions consist of the following:

    1.  Issuing shares, including any indebtedness convertible into shares, or
       any other form of equity in the Company or any subsidiary of the Company
       other than a) granting options to directors or employees of the Company
       pursuant to any incentive or other benefit plan adopted by the Board,
       b) issuing shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of such
       options and c) issuing shares of Common Stock or any security, including
       any debt convertible into shares of Common Stock, or any other form of
       equity in the Company, in one or more offerings, where the aggregate
       purchase price for all such issuances does not exceed $500,000.

    2.  Adoption of any stock-based employee benefit plan by the Company.

    3.  Incurring debt or entering into guarantees for borrowed money (excluding
       trade payables) in excess of $2,500,000 in a 12-month period, subject to
       certain exceptions.

    4.  Selling, leasing, pledging or granting a security interest or
       encumbrance in all or substantially all of the Company's or any
       subsidiary of the Company's assets, except in connection with the
       incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed money that does not involve a
       major decision under 3 above.

    5.  Acquiring (whether through an asset purchase, merger, equity purchase or
       otherwise) any assets (excluding acquisitions of raw materials and
       supplies in the ordinary course of business) having a value, individually
       or in the aggregate for any series of related transactions, in excess of
       $2,000,000.

    6.  Selling or otherwise disposing of any assets (excluding sales or other
       dispositions of inventory in the ordinary course of business) having a
       value, individually or in the aggregate for any series of related
       transactions, in excess of $2,000,000.

    7.  Amending the By-laws or the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company.

    8.  Any Change of Control Transaction (as defined in the Stockholders
       Agreement).

    9.  Executing or delivering any assignment for the benefit of creditors of
       the Company

    10. Filing any voluntary petition in bankruptcy or receivership with respect
       to the Company.

    11. Taking any action while there is a vacancy on the Board, including
       without limitation the filling of such vacancy.

COMPLIANCE WITH SEC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

    Under the securities laws of the United States, our directors, executive
officers, and any persons holding more than 10% of our outstanding Common Stock
(collectively, "insiders") are required to report their initial ownership of the
Company's Common Stock and any subsequent changes in their ownership to the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or the "Commission"). The SEC's rules
require insiders to provide us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that the
insiders file with the Commission. Specific due dates have been established by
the SEC, and we are required to disclose in this proxy statement any failure to
file by those dates. Based solely upon our review of copies of Section 16(a)
reports that we received from insiders for their 2000 transactions, we believe
that our insiders have complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements
applicable to them during 2000.

STOCK OPTION PLANS

    On July 9, 1998 we completed the acquisition of IQI, Inc., a New York
corporation ("IQI").

    In November 1996, IQI established its 1996 Incentive Stock Option Plan. The
IQI Plan provided for the award of incentive stock options to directors,
officers, key employees and members of Thayer's Advisory Board. The IQI Plan was
administered by a compensation committee, as established by IQI's board of
directors. IQI reserved 3,929,774 shares of common stock for issuance under the
IQI Plan. The IQI Plan remains in place, although Aegis common shares are
substituted for IQI shares upon exercise of options.

    Prior to the merger with IQI, our shareholders approved two stock option
plans, which provided for the granting of options to purchase up to 5,000,000
shares of our common stock to key employees, officers and directors. When we
completed the merger with IQI, options to purchase 4,447,000 shares of Common
Stock granted pursuant to these two plans were outstanding.

    In September 1998, we adopted the Aegis Communications Group, Inc. 1998
Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, which allows us to grant options to
purchase up to a maximum of 9,000,000 shares of Common Stock to key employees,
officers and directors. These options are generally exercisable for 10 years
from the date of the grant, subject to vesting schedules. We may grant options
under this plan at any time prior to September 2008. Because we have the 1998
Plan, we do not intend to grant any future options to purchase shares of Common
Stock pursuant to the IQI Plan or our two older Company Plans.

------------------------

(1) Potential realizable value is based on the assumption that the Company's
    Common Stock price appreciates at the annual rate shown (compounded
    annually) from the date of the grant until the end of the option term. The
    amounts have been calculated based on the requirements promulgated by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. The actual value, if any, a named
    executive officer may realize will depend on the excess of the stock price
    over the exercise price on the date the option is exercised (if the
    executive were to sell the shares on the date of exercise). Accordingly,
    there is no assurance that the value actually realized will be at or near
    the potential realizable value as calculated in this table.

(2) These options have a term of 10 years from the date of grant.

(3) Mr. Flynn entered into a separation agreement with the Company on
    February 26, 2001, to be effective April 1, 2001.

through March 31, 2001. Mr. Flynn will be paid an amount equal to his current
gross salary on a bi-weekly pay period, less lawful withholding for twelve
months to a maximum gross payment of $200,000. Such payments commenced on the
separation date. To the extent Mr. Flynn is able to mitigate the amount of such
severance compensation by earning compensation through other employment during
the twelve months following termination, the Company's severance obligation will
be reduced accordingly. The Company will, however, pay Mr. Flynn a minimum of
six month's salary as severance compensation.

primary responsibility to complete the Company's 1999 audit. Mr. Waller received
severance compensation equal, in the aggregate, to his annual base salary

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

    Set forth below is information as of March 31, 2001 concerning:

    - each stockholder known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of each
      class of our voting securities;

    - each director and each named executive officer; and

    - all directors and executive officers as a group.

    We based the percentage of ownership in the table on the following number of
shares of capital stock:

    - 52,171,168 shares of common stock (this number excludes 475,600 shares of
      unretired treasury stock held by the Company);

    - 96,407 shares of Series D Preferred Stock convertible into 4,998,691
      shares of common stock;

    - 54,898 shares of Series E Preferred Stock convertible into 2,397,001
      shares of common stock; and

    - 46,750 shares of Series F Preferred Stock convertible into 53,289,099
      shares of common stock.

    We determine beneficial ownership based on the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. We consider all shares of common stock that
can be issued under convertible securities, warrants or options currently or
within 60 days to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage
ownership of the person holding those securities, but do not consider those
securities to be outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of any other
person. Each owner's percentage is calculated by dividing the number of shares
beneficially held by that owner by the sum of 52,171,168 and the number of
shares that owner has the right to acquire within 60 days.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

    As of December 31, 2000, Michael G. Santry, a former director of the
Company, owed the Company approximately $2.2 million, including accrued
interest, under a secured promissory note dated September 16, 1997. The note
bears interest at an annual rate of 7% and is secured by 7,000 shares of our
Common Stock, options to purchase 1,750,000 shares of our Common Stock held by
Mr. Santry and other collateral. On May 26, 2000, under the terms of an amended
and restated promissory note and an amended pledge agreement, the Company
extended the term of the loan until March 31, 2001 and Mr. Santry agreed to pay
accrued but unpaid interest on the loan for the period October 1, 1999 through
September 30, 2000, pay rent on office space sub-leased from the Company, and
make certain other payments to the Company. On July 1, 2000, October 1, 2000,
January 1, 2001 and April 1, 2001, Mr. Santry defaulted on certain payment
conditions of the amended and restated secured promissory note. As a result, the
Company exercised its rights under the amended and restated secured promissory
note to cancel the options to purchase 1,750,000 shares of our Common Stock held
by Mr. Santry. Mr. Santry resigned as a director of the Company on August 9,
2000. Mr. Santry remains obligated under the promissory note, which remains
secured by the collateral described above, less the cancelled options. Because
Mr. Santry was an affiliate of the Company and the amount of the loan had been
outstanding for more than one year, the balance of the note receivable was
reclassified as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in shareholders'
equity in the fourth quarter of 1999.

    Aegis provides services to certain clients, including its most significant
client, who, directly or through affiliates, have non-controlling ownership
interests in Thayer Equity. In addition, the Company provides services to
certain clients, who, directly or through affiliates, have non-controlling
ownership interests in Questor.

                                       15

    In connection with the IQI merger, the Thayer Investors provided the Company
with $6.8 million in subordinated indebtedness due August 31, 2003, bearing
interest at a 12% annual rate as well as a guarantee for $2.0 million in bridge
financing to assist in funding the Company's working capital needs. In
connection with the guarantee, and for additional consideration of $110,000, the
Company issued to Thayer warrants to purchase 1,100,000 shares of the Company's
Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.96 (the "First Warrant").

    Prior to the IQI merger, on July 2, 1998, the Company received an additional
financing commitment from Thayer and certain other shareholders of IQI. Under
the commitment, the Thayer-led group agreed to lend the Company, at its
election, up to an additional $4.0 million in subordinated indebtedness at any
time within 90 days after the merger. As of October 23, 1998, the Company had
drawn the full commitment amount of $4.0 million. In connection with this
commitment and effective upon the merger, the Company issued the Thayer-led
group additional warrants to purchase up to 350,000 shares of the Company's
Common Stock at an exercise price of $2.375 per share and provided certain
anti-dilution protection (the "Second Warrant"). This indebtedness is
convertible into the Company's Common Stock at a conversion price of $2.375 per
share. This debt is in addition to, and on the same basic terms as, the
subordinated debt that Thayer had previously loaned to the Company.

    On March 30, 1999, Thayer Equity provided the Company with approximately
$5.7 million in additional subordinated indebtedness. Approximately one-half of
the proceeds from this financing were used to pay down bank debt and the
remainder for working capital purposes. The additional indebtedness is
convertible into the Company's Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.15 per
share. This debt is in addition to, and on the same basic terms as, the
subordinated debt that Thayer Equity had previously loaned to the Company.

    In an effort to reduce debt and improve the Company's balance sheet,
effective June 30, 1999, the Thayer-led group agreed to convert approximately
$12.1 million of its subordinated debt into two new series of convertible
preferred stock. The 77,300 shares of new Series D Preferred Stock ($.01 par
value per share, $100 per share liquidation preference) are convertible into
Company Common Stock at $2.00 per share, and the 44,018 shares of new Series E
Preferred ($.01 par value per share, $100 per share liquidation preference) are
convertible into Company Common Stock at $2.375 per share. Both series earn
cumulative dividends (payable-in-kind in additional shares of the respective
series of preferred stock) at the annual rate of 15%, and are non-voting except
on specified matters. In consideration of the conversion of the subordinated
debt into preferred stock, the Company issued the Thayer-led group warrants to
purchase an additional 1,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock (the "Third
Warrant") at $0.90625 per share, the closing price of such stock on the date the
debt was converted into equity.

    On December 17, 1997, IQI issued warrants to Ed Blank to purchase 25,403
shares for $808,600 and 6,013 shares for $191,400, both of which were converted
upon the IQI merger into warrants to purchase 306,347 shares of Company Common
Stock at an exercise price of $3.26 per share (the "Fourth Warrant").

    Paul G. Stern and Frederic V. Malek, each directors of the Company, are
partners in and/or advisors to Thayer Equity.

    Henry L. Druker, Peter D. Fitzsimmons, Dean Anderson, Kevin J. Prokop and
David M. Wathen, each directors of the Company, are partners or affiliates of
Questor.

    As previously noted, on December 10, 1999, we completed the sale of 46,750
shares of newly issued Series F Preferred Stock to the Questor Investors for
$46,750,000 in cash. The Company used this money to repay outstanding bank debt
and pay transaction expenses, including a $1.7 million transaction fee to
Questor Management Company. The Series F Preferred Stock votes on an
as-converted basis (approximately 1000 votes per share) and represents
approximately 50% of our

                                       16
<PAGE>
voting equity stock. In that transaction, the Questor Investors and the Thayer
Investors signed a Stockholder's Agreement that we have described earlier in
this Proxy Statement.

    In addition, we granted the Questor Investors certain registration rights
with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Series F Preferred
Stock. We agreed that, upon written request from the holders of more than 50% of
the Series F Preferred Stock, we would file and cause to become effective one
registration on a form other than Form S-3 and up to three registrations on
Form S-3 covering the Common Stock issued or issuable upon exercise or
conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock held by the Questor Investors. The
Questor Investors may require a "shelf" registration that would remain effective
for at least one year. The Company further agreed to provide the Questor
Investors with certain "incidental", or "piggyback" registration rights, subject
to rights of the Company's underwriters to "cut back" the number of shares to be
included in such registrations. At the same time the Company granted these
rights to the Questor Investors, the Company also granted the same rights to the
Thayer Investors. Previously, the Company had granted the Thayer Investors
certain demand and piggyback registration rights, but with respect only to
certain shares issued in the subordinated debt and warrant transactions
described above. The new grant extends these rights to all shares of Common
Stock held by the Thayer Investors, including shares issued in connection with
the IQI merger.

    On March 1, 2001, the Company received an offer from an acquisition group
made up of its principal shareholders for the purchase of all of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock not already owned by the acquisition group at a price of
$1.00 per share in cash. Questor and certain affiliated funds are leading the
acquisition group and are expected to fund the transaction. The acquisition
group will include Thayer and certain affiliated funds and is expected to
include certain other significant shareholders. It is anticipated that Thayer
and certain other significant shareholders would receive approximately
$10 million of cash in exchange for certain of the Company's securities held by
such shareholders.

    The offer was made to the Company's Board of Directors. On March 15, 2001,
the Board established a special committee of two independent directors to
consider the offer. The special committee has engaged Robert Baird and
Company, Inc., as its independent financial advisor and McDermott, Will and
Emery as its legal counsel in connection with the proposed transaction.
Questor's proposal also indicates that Questor is interested only in acquiring
the publicly held shares, and is not interested in selling its interest in
Aegis.
