<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Stock Option Plans  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective as of August&nbsp;21, 2003, in connection with the anticipated AllServe transaction, all outstanding options to purchase capital stock of the Company
or its subsidiaries were terminated and released by their holders, with an aggregate cost to the Company for obtaining those releases of $53,000. The Company currently has no stock options issued and
outstanding, although it does have an incentive stock option plan in place and 20,929,774 shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under that plan. The Compensation Committee is reviewing
whether it will use equity based compensation in the future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November&nbsp;1996, IQI,&nbsp;Inc. established the 1996 Incentive Stock Option Plan, or the IQI Plan. The IQI Plan provides for the award of incentive stock options to directors,
officers, key employees and members of Thayer's Advisory Board. A Compensation Committee, as established by IQI's Board of Directors, administered the IQI Plan. These options are intended to qualify
as incentive stock options, or ISOs, under the Internal Revenue Code or non-statutory stock options, also referred to as NSOs, which are not intended to qualify. IQI reserved 3,929,774
shares of common stock for issuance under the IQI Plan. Options granted pursuant to the IQI Plan are exercisable for ten years from the date of the grant subject to vesting schedules. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to the merger with IQI, ATC shareholders approved two stock option plans, known as the ATC Plans, which provided for the granting of options to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of
common stock to key employees, officers and directors of ATC and its operating subsidiary. At the date of the IQI Merger, options to purchase 4,447,000 shares of common stock granted pursuant to the
ATC Plans were outstanding. Options granted pursuant to the ATC Plans are exercisable for ten years from the date of the grant subject to vesting schedules. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
September&nbsp;1998, we initiated the Aegis Communications Group,&nbsp;Inc. 1998 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, or the 1998 Aegis Communications Group Plan, which
provides for the granting of options to purchase up to a maximum of 12,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, officers and directors of us and our operating subsidiaries. Options granted
pursuant to the 1998 Aegis Communications Group Plan are exercisable for ten years from the date of the grant subject to vesting schedules. We may grant additional options under the 1998 Aegis
Communications Group Plan at any time prior to September&nbsp;2008. As a result of the adoption of the 1998 Aegis Communications Group Plan, we will not grant any future options to purchase shares
of common stock pursuant to the IQI
Plan or the ATC plansIn connection with the Company's acquisition of IQI,&nbsp;Inc. in 1998, the Company retained the IQI,&nbsp;Inc. 1996 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "IQI Incentive Plan"),
whereby IQI,&nbsp;Inc. awarded incentive stock options to its officers, directors, and key employees. While the IQI Incentive Plan remains in place, shares of the Company's Common Stock are
substituted for shares of IQI Common Stock upon the exercise of stock options previously granted under the IQI Incentive Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has an incentive stock option plan with 20,929,774 shares authorized for issuance, but currently has no stock options outstanding. Prior to the
Company's transaction with Deutsche Bank and Essar in November&nbsp;2003, the Company did use incentive stock options to compensate its Board, with each non-executive director of the
Company receiving non-qualified stock options to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock upon his or her initial election to the Board. Stock options granted were also granted
to the non-executive directors and were priced at 100% of the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date and typically vested in three equal annual increments,
beginning one year from the grant date. Directors who were employees or are otherwise affiliates of the Company were not compensated for their services as directors or committee members. Effective as
of August&nbsp;21, 2003, in connection with the anticipated AllServe transaction, all outstanding options to purchase capital stock of the Company or its subsidiaries were terminated and released by
their holders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to the Deutsche Bank and Essar transaction on November&nbsp;5, 2003, Messrs, Patrick Gross, Josh Weston and Stanton Anderson served on the Board of Directors. During his tenure
as Chairman of the Board in 2003, Mr.&nbsp;Patrick Gross received a monthly director fee of $12,500 for the first three months of that year. Beginning April&nbsp;1, 2003, Mr.&nbsp;Gross received
a quarterly director fee of $12,500, while Mr.&nbsp;Josh Weston and Mr.&nbsp;Stanton Anderson each received annual director fees of $25,000 in 2003. The director fees earned by Mr.&nbsp;Weston
during 2003 were donated to the charity of his choice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;5, 2003, the Company signed definitive documents to effect, and did effect, an investment in the Company by Deutsche Bank and Essar. The
transaction resulted in Deutsche Bank and Essar providing approximately equal portions of a $28.231&nbsp;million investment in the Company in return for three-year secured promissory
notes and warrants to purchase up to 80&nbsp;percent of the Company's common stock on a fully-diluted basis. In addition to the repayment of senior and subordinated debt, the other uses of the
proceeds of the transaction included collateralizing the letters of credit that remained outstanding under the Company's former credit facility, payment of investment banking, legal and accounting
fees, payment of management retention bonuses, and amounts to be reserved for the holders of the Company's Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock. The three-year promissory notes purchased from
the Company by Deutsche Bank and Essar in the transaction have a floating interest rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Borrowing Offered Rate plus 0.50% per annum. Interest under the notes
is payable quarterly in cash or the Company may, at its option cause such interest to be capitalized and added to the principal amount of the notes. The principal amount of each note is payable in two
installments. The first installment of $12.344&nbsp;million was due on the earlier of February&nbsp;5, 2004 or the date on which the Company had availability under a new credit facility. On
January&nbsp;28, 2004, $8.0&nbsp;million of the first required installment was paid as a result of
entering into a new credit facility. On January&nbsp;28, 2004, the promissory notes were amended. The principal amount of the amended notes in the aggregate was $20.231&nbsp;million, with each
note still payable in two installments. The first installment of $4.344&nbsp;million was due as the cash collateralized letters of credit were replaced under the new credit facility and the funds
released to the Company. The Company made additional payments totaling $2.0&nbsp;million dollars in March&nbsp;2004 on the first installment. The remaining balance of $2.344&nbsp;million on the
first installment was amended on March&nbsp;30, 2004 and the maturity date extended to January&nbsp;3, 2005. The second installment of $16.054&nbsp;million, which includes </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Stockholders Agreement  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of a Stockholders Agreement among Deutsche Bank and Essar, Deutsche Bank and Essar each have the right to nominate three of the ten board members,
while the President and Chief Executive Officer, along with three independent directors will be the remaining four board members. Any major decision must be approved by at least three-fourths of the
directors, which must include at least one Deutsche Bank director and one Essar director. As a result, Deutsche Bank and Essar can exercise significant control over the outcome of substantially all
matters that require a Board of Directors or shareholder vote. This fact may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of Aegis Communications Group,&nbsp;Inc. In addition, since our officers
serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, Deutsche Bank and Essar may be able to exert influence over day-to-day operations. Additionally, each committee of the Board
will be constituted so that the number of Deutsche Bank Designees (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) and Essar Designees (as defined in the Stockholders' Agreement) on any such committee is as
nearly as possible in the same proportion as the number of Deutsche Bank Designees and Essar Designees on the entire Board. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Stockholders Agreement provides that the parties to the agreement satisfy a "right of first offer" to the others prior to a transfer of shares to a third party. The Stockholders
Agreement also provides that the parties provide each other with certain "tag-along" rights in the event of a sale or transfer of shares to a third party. The Stockholders' Agreement and
the Bylaws also provide that certain major decisions will require the affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths of the directors
of the Board and the agreement of at least one Deutsche Bank director and one Essar director. The list of major decisions include: </FONT></P>
