PART I

     This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements
with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of
Alliance Financial Corporation and its subsidiary. These forward-looking
statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such
forward-looking statements include, among others, the following possibilities:
(1) an increase in competitive pressure in the banking industry; (2) changes in
the interest rate environment reduce margins; (3) changes in the regulatory
environment; (4) general economic conditions, either nationally or regionally,
are less favorable than expected, resulting in, among other things, a
deterioration in credit quality; (5) changes in business conditions and
inflation; and (6) changes in the securities markets; (7) changes occur in
technology used in the banking business; (8) the new Syracuse area branches do
not attract the expected loan and deposit customers; (9) the ability to maintain
and increase market share and control expenses; and (10) other factors detailed
from time to time in the Company's SEC filings.

Item 1 -- Description of the Business

General

     Alliance Financial Corporation ("Company") is a New York registered bank
holding company formed on November 25, 1998 as a result of the merger of
Cortland First Financial Corporation and Oneida Valley Bancshares, Inc., which
were incorporated in May 30, 1986 and October 31, 1984, respectively. The
Company is the parent holding company of Alliance Bank, N.A. (the "Bank"), which
was formed as the result of a merger of First National Bank of Cortland and
Oneida Valley National Bank as of the close of business, April 16, 1999. Unless
the context otherwise provides, references herein to the "Company" mean Alliance
Financial Corporation and the Bank.

     The Company provides banking services through dual headquarter offices
located at 65 Main Street, Cortland, NY and 160 Main Street, Oneida, NY, as well
as through 19 customer service facilities located in Cortland, Madison,
Onondaga, northern Broome, and western Oneida counties.

     At December 31, 2000, the Company had 266 full-time employees and 22
part-time employees.

     The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Home
Loan Bank System, and deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") up to applicable limits.

Services

     The Company offers full service banking with a broad range of financial
products to meet the needs of its commercial, retail, government, and trust
customers. Depository account services include interest and non-interest bearing
checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, time deposit
accounts, and individual retirement accounts. The Company's lending activities
include the making of residential and commercial mortgage loans, business lines
of credit and business term loans, working capital facilities and accounts
receivable financing programs, as well as installment loans, home equity loans,
student loans, and personal lines of credit to individuals. Trust and investment
department services include personal trust, employee benefit trust, investment
management, custodial, financial planning and brokerage services. The Company
also offers safe deposit boxes, travelers checks, money orders, wire transfers,
collection services, internet banking, drive-up banking facilities, automated
teller machines, 24-hour telephone banking, and 24-hour night depositories.

Competition

     The Company's business is extremely competitive. The Company competes not
only with other commercial banks but also with other financial institutions such
as thrifts, credit unions, money market and mutual funds, insurance companies,
brokerage firms, and a variety of other companies offering financial services.

Supervision and Regulation

     The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHCA") and as such is subject to regulation by
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve
Board"). As a bank holding company, the Company's activities and those of its
subsidiaries are limited to the business of banking and activities closely
related or incidental to banking. The BHCA requires the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve Board in any case where a bank holding company proposes to
acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of
the voting shares of, or substantially all of the assets of, any bank (unless it
owns a majority of such bank's voting shares) or otherwise to control a bank or
to merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. The BHCA also
prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring more
than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank. The Company is a
legal entity separate and distinct from its bank subsidiary. The principal
source of the Company's income is earnings from the Company's subsidiary bank.
Federal laws impose limitations on the ability of subsidiary banks to pay
dividends as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Federal Reserve Board policy requires bank holding companies to serve as a
source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks by standing ready to use
available resources to provide adequate capital funds to their subsidiary banks
during periods of financial stress or adversity. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") substantially revised the
depository institution regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act and made revisions to several other federal banking statures.
Among other things, federal banking regulators are required to take prompt
corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum
capital requirements. FDICIA identifies the following capital categories for
financial institutions: well capitalized, adequately capitalized,
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically
undercapitalized. Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies under FDICIA
provide that an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if the institution
has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based
ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and the
institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive, or
prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any
capital measure. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on
operation, management, and capital distributions, depending on the capital
category in which an institution is classified. At December 31, 2000, the
Company and its subsidiary bank were in the well-capitalized category based on
the ratios and guidelines noted above.

     As a national bank, the Company's subsidiary bank is supervised and
regularly examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the ("OCC").
The various laws and regulations administered by the OCC affect corporate
practices such as payment of dividends, incurrence of debt, and acquisition of
financial institutions, and affect business practices, such as payment of
interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, the types of business
conducted, and location of offices. The Company's regulators have broad
authority to initiate proceedings designed to prohibit its subsidiary bank from
engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices.

     On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("Gramm-Leach") was signed
into law that concluded a decade of debate in the Congress regarding a
fundamental reformation of the nation's financial system. As discussed above,
the activities of bank holding companies have traditionally been limited to the
business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking.
Gramm-Leach now permits bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of
financial activities by electing to become financial holding companies, which
may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other
activities that are financial in nature. Among the activities that will be
deemed "financial in nature", in addition to the traditional lending activities,
securities underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities, are the
sponsoring of mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and
agency activities, merchant banking activities, and activities which the Federal
Reserve Board considers to be closely related to banking. A bank holding company
may become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach only if each of its
subsidiary banks is well capitalized, is well managed and has at least a
satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. A bank holding company
that does not comply with such requirement may be required to cease engaging in
certain activities. Any bank holding company that does not elect to become a
financial holding company remains subject to the current restrictions of the
BHCA. Under Gramm-Leach, the Federal Reserve Board serves as the primary
"umbrella" regulator of financial holding companies with supervisory authority
over each parent company and limited authority over its subsidiaries. The
primary regulator of each subsidiary of a financial holding company will depend
on the type of activity conducted by the subsidiary. At this time, the Company
has not elected to become a financial holding company.

The offices at Fairmount, Lyndon Corners, One Park Place, TOPS Plaza, Tully,

Item 3 -- Legal Proceedings

     In December of 1998, the Oneida Indian Nation ("The Nation") and the U.S.
Justice Department filed a motion to amend a long-standing land claim against
the State of New York to include a class of 20,000 unnamed defendants who own
real property in Madison County and Oneida County. An additional motion sought
to include the Company as a representative of a class of landowners. On
September 25, 2000, the United States District Court of Northern New York
rendered a decision denying the motion to include the landowners as a group, and
thus, excluding the Company and many of its borrowers from the litigation. The
State of New York, the County of Madison and the County of Oneida remain as
defendants in the litigation. This ruling may be appealed by The Nation, and
does not prevent The Nation from suing landowners individually, in which case
the litigation could involve assets of the Company. Management believes that,
ultimately, the State of New York will be held responsible for these claims and
this matter will be settled without adversely impacting the Company.

     There are no other pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation
incidental to the business of the subsidiary bank, to which the Company or its
subsidiary bank is a party or to which their property is the subject. In
management's opinion, no pending action, if adversely decided, would materially
affect the bank or the Company"s financial condition.

Item 4 -- Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     No matter was submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders during
the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2000.

Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

         The Company is a New York Corporation, which was formed in November
1998 as a result of the merger of Cortland First Financial Corporation
("Cortland") and Oneida Valley Bancshares, Inc. ("Oneida"). The Company is a
bank holding company that operates one wholly owned subsidiary, Alliance Bank,
N.A., which provides a full range of financial services in the Central New York
marketplace.

         The following discussion and analysis reviews the Company's business,
and provides information that is intended to provide the reader with a further
understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations
of the Company and its operating subsidiary. This discussion should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes,
and other information included elsewhere in this 2000 Annual Report on Form
10-K.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Net income for 2000 was $5,425,000, or $1.52 per share, compared to
$5,402,000 or $1.51 per share, in 1999. The Company's 2000 net income increased
$23,000 and earnings per share increased $0.01, compared to 1999 results. Growth
in average earning assets in excess of 11% during 2000, that resulted from the
Company's expanding branch network and growing business lines, generated
increased revenues that more than offset a significant increase in the Company's
cost of funds caused by higher market interest rates throughout the year.
Increased net interest income, combined with substantial increases in
non-interest income, offset higher operating expenses and income taxes, and
resulted in an increase in net income over the prior year. Although the return
on average assets declined from 1.09% in 1999 to 0.98% in 2000, the return on
average equity increased over the comparable periods from 10.56% to 10.86%.

NET INTEREST INCOME

     Net interest income is the Company's principal source of operating income
for payment of overhead and providing for possible loan losses. It is the amount
that interest and fees on loans, investments, and other earning assets exceeds
the cost of deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities.

     Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased $253,000, to
$21,754,000 in 2000 following an increase of $1,520,000 in 1999 when compared to
the prior year. The growth in net interest income resulted from increases in
average earning assets during the year 2000, which offset a declining net
interest margin.

     Loans represented the majority of the Company's interest earning assets and
have remained stable at 58% of earning assets over the past three years. Average
loans increased $34,560,000 in 2000 with yields increasing 26 basis points to
8.94%. The Company reported higher yields on commercial and consumer loans but
lower yields on its residential mortgage loans. Commercial loans were most
favorably impacted by the rise in short-term market rates since the majority of
the portfolio is indexed to the Wall Street Journal Prime or other similar
short-term market rates. The average yield on commercial loans in 2000 increased
85 basis points compared to 1999. The average yield on consumer loans,
particularly indirect auto loans, increased 13 basis points, as the Company's


                                       10
<PAGE>

growth in the business was influenced by very competitive pricing. The average
yield on the residential mortgage portfolio declined 27 basis points in 2000 as
longer term interest rates moved in a more narrow range during the year, and
most of the new business was originated in a lower yielding adjustable rate
product. Interest income on loans in 2000 was up $3,778,000, or 16.5%, compared
to 1999. Average loans in 1999 increased $19,312,000 compared to 1998 while
average loan yields declined 30 basis points. Interest income on loans was up
$959,000 in 1999 compared to 1998.

     Average investments in 2000 increased by $22,504,000, with tax-equivalent
interest income from investments up $1,869,000 compared to 1999. In comparison,
average investment securities increased $27,588,000 in 1999 compared to 1998,
with tax-equivalent interest income up $1,702,000. The average tax-equivalent
yield of the portfolio increased 18 basis points, from 6.41% in 1999 to 6.59% in
2000. Interest income in 2000 from the sale of federal funds in the amount of
$286,000 declined $147,000 compared to 1999 as the Company reduced its average
federal funds sold balances throughout the year.

     Tax-equivalent interest income for 2000 at $41,221,000, was $5,500,000 more
than 1999, with the 2000 tax-equivalent yield on average earning assets at
7.94%, an increase of 27 basis points over 1999. Average earning assets for 2000
were $518,899,000, up $53,318,000 compared to 1999, and represented 93.8% of
total average assets in 2000. Asset yields showed steady improvement throughout
the year following repeated Federal Reserve Board actions that increased the
federal funds rate. Tax equivalent interest income for 1999 at $35,721,000, was
$2,342,000 more than 1998, although the 1999 tax equivalent yield on average
earning assets was 7.67%, 19 basis points less than 1998. Average earning assets
for 1999 were $465,581,000, up $41,155,000 compared to 1998. Average earning
assets in 1999 were 93.6% of total average assets.

     During 2000, average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $57,491,000,
or 14.9%, to $444,191,000. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 70
basis points from 3.68% in 1999 to 4.38% in 2000. The Company's interest
expense, which is a function of the volume of and rates paid for interest
bearing liabilities, increased $5,247,000, or 36.9%, in 2000. The increase was
primarily a result of volume and rate increases on time deposits, along with
higher rates paid on increased borrowings primarily through the Federal Home
Loan Bank. By comparison, interest expense increased $822,000, or 6.1%, in 1999
compared to 1998 as a result of volume increases in time deposit balances and
Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. During 1999, average interest-bearing
liabilities increased by $41,800,000, or 12.12%, to $386,700,000. The cost of
interest-bearing liabilities declined 20 basis points from 3.88% in 1998 to
3.68% in 1999.

     The Company's net interest margin (federal tax-equivalent net interest
income divided by average earning assets) declined 43 basis points, from 4.62%
in 1999, to 4.19% in 2000, following a 9 basis point decline the prior year.

     The following table sets forth information concerning average
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the yields and
rates thereon. Interest income and yield information is adjusted for items
exempt from federal income taxes and assumes a 34% tax rate. Non-accrual loans
have been included in the average balances. Securities are shown at average
amortized cost.

     The following table sets forth the dollar volume of increase (decrease) in
interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in the volume of
earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and from changes in rates.
Volume changes are computed by multiplying the volume difference by the prior
year's rate. Rate changes are computed by multiplying the rate difference by the
prior year's balance. The change in interest due to both rate and volume has
been allocated equally between the volume and rate variances.

NON-INTEREST INCOME

     Non-interest income for 2000 was $6,649,000, which was up 45.9%, or
$2,091,000, compared to 1999. Non-interest income increased 14.3%, or $569,000,
in 1999. The Company's non-interest income is composed of recurring fees from
normal banking operations, trust and data processing department fees, and net
gains/losses from sales of investment securities. Income from service charges on
deposits at $1,993,000, up 2.8% from the prior year following a 13.7% increase
in 1999 over 1998, was the principal source of the bank's non-interest income.
Trust department income increased 22.8% in 2000 to $1,393,000, compared to
$1,134,000 in 1999. The growth in trust revenue is a reflection of both an
increase in the market value of trust department assets as well as growth in the
departments' customer base resulting from strong new business development
efforts over the past two years. Trust department income represents 21% of total
non-interest income. Trust department income increased 43.7% in 1999 compared to
1998. Significant contributions to the Company's non-interest income were
derived from electronic banking service fees, data processing service contracts
with other financial institutions, and dividends received from the credit
insurance programs offered through the Company's subsidiary bank. During 2000,
the Company took gains from the sale of both equity and fixed income investment
securities. Gains on sales of securities in 2000 of $711,000 compared to
$136,000 in 1999 and $26,000 in 1998. A purchase of company owned life insurance
in the fourth quarter of 1999, generated other income in 2000 in the form of
increases in its cash value of $469,000, compared to $80,000 in 1999. In the
third quarter of the year, the Company booked a $532,000 gain on the termination
of the former Oneida Valley National Bank defined benefit pension plan. The
Company approved termination of the plan in 1999 in connection with the merger
of the banks and the subsequent consolidation and creation of a uniform plan of
employee benefits.

The following table sets forth certain information on non-interest income for
the years indicated.

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE

     Operating expense in 2000 increased $2,012,000, or 12.1%, compared to 1999.
Excluding 1998 nonrecurring merger-related expenses, non-interest expense in
1999 was up $829,000, or 5.2%, compared to 1998. Salaries and associated benefit
expenses in 2000 were up $1,302,000, or 14.3%, compared to a 4.6% increase in
1999, and represented the majority of the increase. Increases in salary and
benefit expenses were associated with the staffing of three new Syracuse area
branches that opened during the year, the addition of new business development
and account officers employed in the growing commercial loan, indirect loan,
municipal, and trust departments, along with the addition of several key
administrative personnel including a new bank president. The Company's occupancy
and equipment expense increased $274,000, or 10.6%, in 2000 compared to 1999.
The opening of the three new branches during the year contributed significantly
to the increase. Increased costs associated with the purchase and development of
technology systems designed to provide customers account access through the
internet also contributed to the increase. Occupancy and equipment expense
declined approximately 1% in 1999 compared to 1998. Other non-interest expense
increased $436,000, or 8.9% compared to last year. In 2000, higher expenses were
associated with the Company's loan origination and servicing areas relating
specifically to credit analysis and legal collection services. Fees paid for
trust accounting services were up, as were other expense categories including
FDIC insurance, telephone expense, and contributions. Excluding 1998 merger
related expenses, other operating expense in 1999 increased $449,000, or 10%,
compared to 1998.

favorable return on low-risk, high-quality investments. The Company classifies
the majority of its investment securities as available-for-sale to support and
maintain the Company's interest risk objectives. The Company does not engage in
securities trading or derivatives activities in carrying out its investment
strategies. Based on amortized cost, the Company classified 95% of its
investment portfolio as available-for-sale at year-end 2000. The Company's book
value of investment debt securities increased $22,649,000, or 11.6%, in the 12
months ended December 31, 2000 to a total of $217,787,000, compared to an
increase of $26,705,000, or 15.9%, in 1999 over 1998. The average tax-equivalent
yield of the portfolio increased 18 basis points, from 6.41% in 1999 to 6.59% in
2000. The portfolio yield increased 13 basis points in 1999 compared to 1998.

     During the year ended December 31, 2000, market interest rates declined
significantly, with the yield on three year U.S. Treasury securities
approximately 125 basis points below its December 31, 1999 rate. The decline in
rates, which causes an increase in the market value of fixed rate investment
securities, resulted in the Company's available-for-sale investment securities
reflecting a market value which was 0.56% greater than the portfolios' book
value. In compliance with SFAS 115, the Company reflects net unrealized gains
and losses on its available-for-sale portfolio in its financial statement
investment securities total, as well as the after tax effect of the gains and
losses in the accumulated other comprehensive income section of its
shareholders' equity. The Company's investment portfolio reflects an unrealized
gain on available-for-sale securities of $1,171,000, with an after tax effect of
$702,000 being reflected as an increase in shareholders equity. At December 31,
1999, the Company reported unrealized losses in its available-for-sale portfolio
of $3,476,000 and a decrease in shareholders' equity of $2,086,000.

     The composition of the portfolio as of December 31, 2000 consisted of U.S.
Treasury and Agency securities representing 23% of the total, mortgage-backed
securities at 42%, tax-exempt investments at 24%, and other securities
representing 11% of the total. Changes in the composition of the portfolio
during 2000 reflected an increase in mortgage-backed securities with a reduction
in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities. Gains on sales of investment securities
in 2000 were $711,000 compared to $136,000 in 1999 and $26,000 in 1998.

(1)  Weighted average yields on the tax-exempt obligations have been computed on
     a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a marginal federal tax rate of 34%.
     These yields are an arithmetic computation of interest income divided by
     average balance and may differ from the yield to maturity which considers
     the time value of money.

LOANS

     The loan portfolio is the largest component of the Company's earning assets
and accounts for the greatest portion of total interest income. The Company
provides a full range of loan products delivered through its branch network.
Consistent with the focus on providing community banking services, the Company
generally does not attempt to diversify geographically by making a significant
amount of loans to borrowers outside of the primary service area. Loans are
internally generated and lending activity is primarily confined to Cortland,
Madison, Onondaga, northern Broome, and Western Oneida counties. The Company
does not engage in highly leveraged transactions or foreign lending activities.

     The following table sets forth the composition of the Company's loan
portfolio at the dates indicated.

     On December 31, 2000, loans (net of unearned discount) were $315,748,000,
increasing $30,311,000, or 10.6%, during the year. Loans increased $32,141,000,
or 12.7%, in 1999. Although the majority of the Company's loans continue to be
residential mortgage loans on our customers' primary residences, increasing
emphasis has been placed on growing the commercial and consumer loan portfolios.
Residential mortgage loans, which represented 38.4% of net loans at December 31,
2000, increased $5,498,000, or 4.8%, during 2000 following an increase of
$880,000, or approximately 1%, in 1999 compared to 1998. The mortgage portfolio
consists of 77% in fixed-rate loans, and 23% in loans that have adjustable rate
features. The Company originated $16,961,000 in mortgage loans during 2000. As
of December 31, 2000, the Company was servicing mortgage loans sold in the
secondary market with balances of $15,766,000. The total of mortgage loans being
serviced at December 31, 1999 was $16,612,000.

     Loans in the commercial category consist primarily of short-term and/or
floating rate loans, lines of credit, as well as commercial mortgage loans, made
to small and medium-sized companies. Commercial loans in 2000 increased
$3,278,000, or 3.1%, to $108,447,000, following an increase of $25,048,000, or
31.3%, in 1999 when compared to 1998. Growth in commercial relationships, and
increased use of approved lines of credit throughout the year, resulted in
average commercial loans during 2000 being $18,502,000, or 20.9%, greater than
1999.

     Consumer loans, net of unearned discount, which include indirect auto, home
equity, and revolving credit loans, increased 32.7%, or $21,535,000, to
$87,353,000 as of December 31, 2000 compared to year-end 1999. During 2000, the
Company continued its focus on indirect auto lending and significantly increased
the number of dealers that it has relationships with. Indirect auto loans
increased $21,820,000, or 108%, in 2000 compared to 1999, following an increase
of $3,865,000, or 23.6%, in 1999 compared to 1998.

     The following table shows the amount of loans outstanding as of December
31, 2000, which, based on remaining scheduled payments of principal, are due in

</TABLE>

     Non-performing assets, defined as non-accruing loans plus loans 90 days or
more past due, along with other real estate owned and other repossessed assets
as of December 31,2000 were $1,821,000, increasing $461,000, or 33.9%, compared
to year-end 1999. The ratio of non-performing assets to year-end loans, other
real estate owned, and other repossessed assets increased 20.8% during 2000,
from 0.48% at December 31, 1999 to 0.58% at December 31, 2000. The ratio had
increased 4 basis points, or 1%, during 1999, as compared to 1998.

     The Company's policy is to place a loan on non-accrual status and recognize
income on a cash basis when it is more than ninety days past due, unless in the
opinion of management, the loan is well secured and in the process of
collection. The impact of interest not recognized on non-accrual loans was
immaterial in 2000. The Company considers a loan impaired when, based on current
information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to
collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to
the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The measurement of impaired loans
is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the
historical effective interest rate, except that all collateral-dependent loans
are measured for impairment based on fair value of the collateral. As of
December 31, 2000, there were no impaired loans for which specific valuation
allowances had been recorded.

     The Company has a loan review program that it believes takes a conservative
approach to evaluating non-performing loans and the loan portfolio in general.
The loan review program continually audits the loan portfolio to confirm
management's loan risk rating system and track problem loans, to insure
compliance with loan policy underwriting guidelines, and to evaluate the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.

     Management determines the allowance for loan losses based on a number of
factors including reviewing and evaluating the bank's loan portfolio in order to
identify potential problem loans, concentrations of credit, and risk factors
connected to the portfolio, as well as current local and national economic
conditions. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of an
amount that is adequate to provide for potential losses inherent in the loan
portfolio. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses, in
accordance with the Company's loan policy, when they are determined by
management to be uncollectible. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are
credited to the allowance for loan losses when they are received. When
management determines that the allowance for loan losses is less than adequate
to provide for potential losses, a direct charge is made to operating income.

     The allowance for loan losses account at December 31, 2000 was $3,370,000,
or 1.07% of loans outstanding (net of unearned discount), compared to
$3,412,000, or 1.20% of loans outstanding (net of unearned discount), at
December 31, 1999.

     The provision expense in 2000 of $1,150,000 approximated the net charge-off
amount of $1,192,000. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding
increased to 0.40% in 2000 compared to 0.21% in 1999. Significant losses on two
commercial loans in 2000 increased gross commercial loan charge-offs to $780,000
compared to $73,000 in 1999. Loan losses in the Company's residential mortgage
loan portfolio continue to be negligible, while net consumer loan losses in 2000
of $431,000, representing 0.57% of average net consumer loans outstanding,
declined from $475,000, or 0.75% of average net consumer loans outstanding in
1999.

     The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans at December 31, 2000 at
0.46% increased from 0.38% at December 31, 1999, but continues to compare
favorably to the most recent peer bank data contained in the Uniform Bank
Performance Report for all banks with assets between $500,000,000 and
$1,000,000,000 in total assets as published by the Federal Reserve Board's
Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, which as of September 30, 2000
reported a peer average of 0.63%. The adequacy of the allowance to provide
coverage for non-performing loans was 230% at year-end 2000 compared to 313% at
year-end 1999.

     The following table summarizes loan balances at the end of each period
indicated and the daily average amount of loans. Also summarized are changes in
the allowance for possible losses arising from loans charged-off and recoveries
on loans previously charged-off and additions to the allowance, which have been
charged to expense.

DEPOSITS AND OTHER BORROWINGS

     The Company's deposit accounts represent its primary source of funds. The
deposit base is comprised of demand deposit, savings and money market accounts,
and other time deposits which are provided by individuals, businesses, and local
governments within the communities served. The Company continuously monitors
market pricing, competitors' rates, and internal interest rate spreads to
maintain and promote growth and profitability.

     Average deposits for 2000 increased $28,756,000, or 6.7%, to $459,836,000,
compared to a $34,253,000, or 8.6%, increase in 1999 over 1998. Compared to
December 31, 1999, deposits as of December 31, 2000 in the amount of
$474,899,000 were up $39,825,000, or 9.2%. The Company opened three new branches
in the second half of 2000, which contributed $10,000,000, or 25% of the
increase. Over the past three years, as a result of rising interest rates and
competitive markets, the Company's deposit mix has reflected a slight shift from
lower cost demand deposit, savings, and money market accounts, to higher cost
time deposit accounts. The Company's average demand deposits, including both
interest-bearing and non interest-bearing accounts, declined 2% as a percentage
of total average deposits, to 25.6% during 2000, following a 1.3% decline the
prior year. These core transactional accounts continue to represent a
significant percentage of total deposits and provide the Company with an
important low cost source of funds. With a higher level of market interest rates
during 2000, average time deposits increased $26,420,000, or 16.2%, compared to
1999, following an increase of $22,476,000, or 16%, when comparing 1999 to 1998.
Depositors continued to favor time deposits with maturities of 18 months or
less. Time deposits in excess of $100 thousand, which are more volatile and
sensitive to interest rates, totaled $94,728,000 at year-end 2000, 44.3% of
total time deposits and 19.9% of total deposits, compared to 43.2%, and 16.7%,
respectively, at year-end 1999. The Company has been more aggressive in
acquiring large balance time deposits in the past two years, matching the
liabilities with assets that have similar interest rate risk characteristics.
The Company's total municipal deposits of $118,286,000 on December 31, 2000
represented 24.9% of total deposits compared to $110,819,000, or 25.5%, on
December 31, 1999.

     The average daily amount of deposits, the average rate paid, and the
percentage of deposits on each of the following deposit categories are
summarized below for the years indicated.

The following table indicates the amount of the Company's time deposits of
$100,000 or more by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2000.

     The Company offers retail repurchase agreements primarily to its larger
business customers. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company sells
investment portfolio securities to the customer and agrees to repurchase the
securities at a specified later date. The Company views the arrangement as a
deposit alternative for its business customers. As of December 31, 2000,
repurchase agreements amounted to $6,936,000 compared to balances of $7,225,000
at December 31, 1999. During 2000, the Company continued to utilize advances
from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York as a liability management practice
and as an alternative source of funding to deposits. At December 31, 2000, term
advances in the amount of $36,750,000 compared to $15,000,000 at December 31,
1999. These borrowings, which have various terms and maturities, are considered
an alternative to purchasing large time deposits from corporate or municipal
customers based on cost and timing issues. Borrowings are frequently maturity
matched against specific or pooled loans. At December 31, 2000, the Company had
overnight advances outstanding of $2,400,000 compared to $9,000,000 at December
31, 1999.

OTHER LIABILITIES

     Other liabilities increased $3,114,000, or 85.2%, when comparing December
31, 2000 to December 31, 1999. The primary reason for the change was a
$1,859,000 increase in income tax payable as a result of a $4,647,000
appreciation in the Company's investment portfolio. During the year ended
December 31, 1999, a $5,291,000 decline in the value of the Company's
available-for-sale investment securities reduced the tax liability by $2,117,000
as total liabilities declined by $2,538,000 compared to 1998. Other liabilities
increasing during 2000 were interest payable, up $477,000 due to higher interest
rates paid on deposits and borrowings, increased dealer reserves payable
associated with the growth in indirect loans, along with increases in
post-retirement plans, deferred compensation, and supplemental executive
retirement plans.

CAPITAL

     In 2000, the Company added $5,425,000 into equity through net income and
returned $2,534,000 to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends, retaining
$2,891,000 in undivided profits. During the year, the Company repurchased 91,441
shares of its common stock at a cost of $1,889,000 in connection with a stock
repurchase program. The board of directors believes that the 2000 repurchases of
stock have been an excellent investment opportunity for the Company and its
shareholders, based on the Company's strong capital position and growth
potential. Total shareholders' equity also reflects an adjustment for the SFAS
115 required change in market value of the Company's available-for-sale
investment securities. As previously discussed in the Investment Securities
section, the after-tax effect of the net unrealized gains and losses is reported
as the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income component of shareholders' equity,
and reflects an increase in total shareholders' equity of $702,000 as of
December 31, 2000. The Company's ratio of shareholders' equity to total assets
of 9.13% at December 31, 2000 compares to 9.48% at December 31, 1999. The
Company's goal is to maintain a strong capital position, consistent with the
risk profile of its subsidiary bank, that supports growth and expansion
activities while at the same time exceeding regulatory standards. Capital
adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios
which measure capital against total assets, as well as against total assets,
that are weighted based on defined risk characteristics. At December 31, 2000,
the Company exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios and met the
regulatory definition of a "well capitalized institution". A more comprehensive
analysis of regulatory capital requirements, including ratios for the Company
and its subsidiary bank, is included in Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial
Statements section of this Annual Report.


                                       24
<PAGE>

     The Company paid cash dividends equal to $0.71 per share in 2000 compared
to $0.70 in 1999. During the second quarter of the year, the Company paid a 5%
stock dividend and in the fourth quarter of the year, the quarterly dividend
rate was increased from $0.175 per share to $0.185 per share. The 2000 dividend
pay-out ratio was 47%.


LIQUIDITY

     Liquidity is the ability of the Company to generate and maintain sufficient
cash flows to fund its operations and to meet customer's loan demands or deposit
withdrawals. Maintaining a stable core deposit base is one of the fundamentals
in the Company's liquidity management policy. It is the Company's goal to raise
cash when needed, at the most reasonable cost, with a minimum of loss.
Management carefully monitors its liquidity position and seeks to maintain
adequate liquidity to meet its needs. The Company meets its liquidity needs by
balancing levels of cash flow from the sale or maturity of available-for-sale
investment securities and loan amortizing payments and maturities, as well as
with the availability of dependable borrowing sources which can be accessed when
needed. Lines of credit with the bank's primary correspondents and the Federal
Home Loan Bank as of year-end 2000 were $97,209,000, of which $58,059,000
remained available.

Item 7A -- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

     Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from
adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. The Company's
market risk arises principally from interest rate risk in its lending, deposit
and borrowing activities. Other types of market risks do not arise in the normal
course of the Company's business activities. Management actively monitors and
manages its interest rate risk exposure. Although the Company manages other
risks, as in credit quality and liquidity risk, in the normal course of
business, management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant
market risk and could potentially have the largest material effect on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company's
profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Management's goal
is to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate
fluctuations and earnings. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may
adversely impact the Company's earnings to the extent that the interest rates on
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not change at the
same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. The Company monitors the
impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using a computer
simulation model.

     The model measures the change in net interest income which results when
market interest rates change. As of December 31, 2000, an instantaneous 200
basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to have a negative
impact of 11.90% on net interest income over the next twelve-month period, while
a 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates was estimated to have a
positive impact of 6.73% on the Company's net interest income. By comparison, at
December 31, 1999 the Company estimated an instantaneous 200 basis point rise in
rates would have a negative impact of 5.19% on net interest income during 2000
while a 200 basis point decline in rates would have a positive impact of 3.63%
on net interest income during 2000. The Company aligned its asset/liability mix
during 2000 on expectations that the economy would slow in 2001, and as a result
the Federal Reserve Bank Board would begin to lower interest rates. The Company
increased its short-term liabilities through increased municipal certificates of
deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances while at the same time investing in
longer term investment securities. The Company expects both an improvement in
its net interest margin and the potential for gains on the sale of securities
with lower interest rates. The potential change in net interest income resulting
from this analysis falls within the Company's interest rate risk policy
guidelines.

     Computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes
are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest
rates, loan prepayments and deposit rate changes, and should not be relied upon
as indicative of actual results.

     The following table shows the Company's financial instruments that are
sensitive to changes in interest rates, categorized by expected maturity, and
the instruments' fair values at December 31, 2000.

     Expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of
principal. The Company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and
expected maturities. For assets, expected maturities are based upon contractual
maturity, projected repayments and prepayment of principal. The prepayment
experience reflected herein is based on the Company's historical experience. The
actual maturities and run-off of loans could vary substantially if future
prepayments differ from the Company's historical experience. For liabilities,
Regular Savings and Now Accounts of individuals, partnerships and corporations
(IPC) are considered to be 90% core (maturing in over five years), with 10%
assumed to mature in one year. IPC Money Market Savings are considered to be 75%
core. Savings and Now Accounts of municipalities are considered 75% core
(maturing in over five years), with 25% assumed to mature in one year. Money
Market Savings accounts of public entities are considered to be 50% core.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations: Alliance Financial Corporation (the Company) is a bank
holding company, which owns and operates Alliance Bank, N.A. The Company
provides financial services primarily to individuals, small- to medium-sized
businesses and government customers from 21 office locations in Broome,
Cortland, Madison, Oneida, and Onondaga counties. The Bank has a substantially
wholly owned subsidiary, Alliance Preferred Funding Corp., which is engaged in
residential real estate activity.

Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary after elimination of
intercompany accounts and transactions.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Business Combination: In November 1998, Cortland First Financial Corporation
(Cortland) completed a merger with Oneida Valley Bancshares, Inc. (Oneida) and
commenced operations under the name Alliance Financial Corporation. Pursuant to
the terms of the merger, each share of Cortland stock was exchanged for one
share of the Company's stock and each share of Oneida stock was exchanged for
1.8 shares of the Company's stock. The merger constituted a tax-free
reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16.

     In conjunction with the merger, the Company recorded a 1998 charge to
operating expenses of $1,701 ($1,022 after taxes, or $0.28 per common share) for
direct merger and restructuring costs relating to the merger. Restructuring
costs primarily relate to the consolidation of administration and operational
functions.

Reclassification: Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect
on net income as previously reported.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, and federal funds
sold. Generally, federal funds are purchased and sold for one-day periods.

Investment Securities: The Company classifies investment securities as
held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are those
that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, and
are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts. Investment securities not classified as held-to-maturity are
classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with net
unrealized holding gains and losses reflected as a separate component of
stockholders' equity, net of the applicable income tax effect. None of the
Company's investment securities have been classified as trading securities.
Gains and losses on the sale of investment securities are based on the specific
identification method. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and
accreted into income using the interest method over the life of the security.


                                       32

Loans: Loans are stated at unpaid principal balances less the allowance for loan
losses, unearned interest income and net deferred loan origination fees and
costs.

     Unearned income on certain installment loans is taken into income on the
actuarial method. Interest on all other loans is based upon the principal amount
outstanding. Interest on loans is accrued except when in management's opinion
the collectibility of interest is doubtful, at which time the accrual of
interest on the loan is discontinued.

     Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred and the net amount is amortized as a yield adjustment over the life of
the loan. The Company is generally amortizing these amounts over the contractual
life of the related loans. However, for certain fixed-rate mortgage loans that
are generally made for a 20-year term, the Company has anticipated prepayments
and used an estimated life of 7.5 years.

Allowance for Credit Losses: The adequacy of the allowance for possible loan
losses is periodically evaluated by the Company in order to maintain the
allowance at a level that is sufficient to absorb probable credit losses.
Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on a review of
the Company's historical loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan
portfolio, including adverse circumstances that may affect the ability of the
borrower to repay interest and/or principal, the estimated value of collateral,
and an analysis of the levels and trends of delinquencies, charge-offs, and the
risk ratings of the various loan categories. Such factors as the level and trend
of interest rates and the condition of the national and local economies are also
considered.

     A loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if
it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments
of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement. The measurement of impaired loans is generally discounted at the
historical effective interest rate, except that all collateral-dependent loans
are measured for impairment based on fair value of the collateral.


                                       33
<PAGE>

Income Recognition on Impaired and Nonaccrual Loans: Loans, including impaired
loans, are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due as to
maturity of payment of principal or interest for a period of more than 90 days
unless they are well secured and are in the process of collection. While a loan
is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectibility of the recorded loan
balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied
as a reduction to principal outstanding.

Other Real Estate: Other real estate is comprised of real estate acquired
through foreclosure and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value (net of
estimated costs to sell) at the date of acquisition.

Bank Premises, Furniture, and Equipment: Bank premises, furniture, and equipment
are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation computed principally using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance
and repairs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. The asset cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts for assets sold or
retired and any resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of the
income.

Income Taxes: Provision for income taxes is based on taxes currently payable or
refundable and deferred income taxes on temporary differences between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial
statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported in the financial
statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in
which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or
settled.

Trust Department Assets: Assets held in fiduciary or agency capacities for
customers are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
condition, since such items are not assets of the Company. Fees associated with
providing trust management services are recorded on a cash basis of income
recognition and are included in Other Income.

Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding throughout each
year; 3,569,073, 3,576,728, and 3,596,548 for 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. Diluted earnings per share gives the effect to weighted average
shares which would be outstanding assuming the exercise of options using the
treasury stock method. Weighted average shares outstanding adjusted for the
effect of the assumed exercise of stock options were 3,579,114, 3,577,109, and
3,596,548 for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. For the years ending
December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998 both basic and diluted earnings per share were
$1.52, $1.51, and $0.95, respectively.

RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

     The Company provides retirement benefits through a defined contribution
401(k) plan that covers substantially all of its employees. Prior to July 1,
1999, a group of employees were covered by a noncontributory defined benefit
pension plan. That plan was terminated effective June 30, 1999 and following a
satisfactory review by the Internal Revenue Service, distributions of plan
participants benefit obligations were completed during the third quarter of
2000. As a result of the settlement, the Company received $1,239 and recognized
a net gain of $532 in other operating income. The pension plan had no assets
remaining at December 31, 2000. The Company also provides postretirement medical
and life insurance benefits to qualifying employees under a plan developed in
the fourth quarter of 1999. Benefits are available to full-time employees who
have worked 15 years and attained age 55. Retirees and certain active employees
with more than 20 years of service to the Company continue to receive benefits
in accordance with the former plans.

     The following tables set forth the changes in the plan's benefit
obligation, fair value of plan assets, and prepaid (accrued) benefit cost as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999.

For measurement purposes, with respect to the postretirement benefit plans, a
6.5 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health
care benefits is assumed for 2001. The rate is assumed to decrease gradually to
4.5 percent by the year 2005 and remain at that level thereafter.

Contributions to the Company's 401(k) plan are determined by the Board of
Directors and are based on percentages of compensation for eligible employees.
Contributions are funded following the end of the plan (calendar) year. Company
contributions to the plan were $470, $440, and $425 in 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION & SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company maintains optional deferred compensation plans for its directors,
whereby fees normally received are deferred and paid by the Company upon the
retirement of the director. At December 31, 2000 and 1999 other liabilities
included approximately $1,142 and $980, respectively, relating to deferred
compensation. Deferred compensation expense for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999, and 1998 approximated $162, $191, and $157, respectively.

The Company has supplemental executive retirement plans for certain employees.
Included in other assets, the Company has segregated assets of $878 and $875 at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, to fund the estimated benefit
obligation. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, other liabilities included
approximately, $1,026 and $904 accrued under these plans. The benefit
obligation, service cost, and actuarial gain/(loss) were $1,339, $189, and
($272), respectively, at December 31, 2000 and $839, $124, and $58,
respectively, at December 31, 1999. Compensation expense includes approximately
$138, $65, and $87 relating to these plans at December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively.


STOCK OPTION PLAN

During November 1998, shareholders approved the 1998 long-term incentive
compensation plan. This plan authorized grants of options of up to 400,000
shares of authorized but unissued common stock of the Company. Under the plan,
the Board of Directors may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, and restricted stock awards to officers, employees, and certain other
individuals. All options have a 10-year term. Of the 306,914 options outstanding
at December 31, 2000, 20,000 options vest and become exercisable ratably over a
three-year period. The remainder of the options vest one year after the issue
date and become exercisable based on the Company achieving specified stock
prices. At December 31, 2000, there were 93,086 shares available for grant.

The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plan in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for stock options in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. Had the Company determined compensation cost
based on the fair value of its stock options at the grant date under SFAS No.

pro forma amounts indicated in the following table:

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit
and letters of credit which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk
in excess of amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of condition. The
contract amount of those commitments and letters of credit reflects the extent
of involvement the Company has in those particular classes of financial
instruments. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for commitments
to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount
of the instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making
commitments and letters of credit as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

     Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk:

                                                      Contract Amount
                                             -------------------------------
                                               2000                   1999
                                             -------                --------
                                                  (Dollars In Thousands)
Commitments to extend credit                 $46,057                $38,351
Standby letters of credit                       $346                 $1,443

     Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payments of a fee. Since some of the commitment amounts are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements.

     Standby letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the
Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those
guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing
arrangements, including bond financing and similar transactions.

     The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the
same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Since the
letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

     For both commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, the amount of
collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon the extension of
credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty.
Collateral held varies, but includes residential and commercial real estate.

     Principal operating leases are for bank premises. At December 31, 2000,
aggregate future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
with initial or remaining terms equal to or exceeding one year consisted of the
following: 2001-$211; 2002-$185; 2003-$179; 2004-$128; 2005-$128; and $1,016
thereafter. Total rental expenses amounted to $241 in 2000, $147 in 1999, and
$146 in 1998.

     The Company is required to maintain a reserve balance as established by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The required average total reserve for the
14-day maintenance period ended December 31, 2000 was $2,050.

DIVIDENDS AND RESTRICTIONS (Dollars In Thousands)

The primary source of cash to pay dividends to the Company's shareholders is
through dividends from its banking subsidiary. The Federal Reserve Board and the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are authorized to determine certain
circumstances that the payment of dividends would be unsafe or unsound practice
and to prohibit payment of such dividends. The payment of dividends that deplete
a bank's capital base could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound
practice. Banking organizations may generally only pay dividends from the
combined current year and prior two years net income less any dividends
previously paid during that period. At December 31, 2000, approximately $3,800
was available for the declaration of dividends by the bank. There were no loans
or advances from the subsidiary bank to the Company at December 31, 2000.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair
Value of Financial Instruments," requires disclosure of fair value information
of financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the statement of
condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using
present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly
affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of
future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be
substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not
be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. Accordingly, the
aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of
the Company.

</TABLE>

The fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is
not significant.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its
fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated
statement of condition for cash and short-term instruments approximate those
assets' fair value.

Investments Securities: Fair values for investment securities are based on
quoted market prices or dealer quotes.

Loans: Fair values for loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis,
based on interest rates approximating those currently being offered for loans
with similar terms and credit quality. The fair value of accrued interest
approximates carrying value.

Deposits: The fair values disclosed for noninterest-bearing accounts and
accounts with no stated maturity are, by definition, equal to the amount payable
on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of time deposits was estimated
by discounting expected monthly maturities at interest rates approximating those
currently being offered on time deposits of similar terms. The fair value of
accrued interest approximates carrying value.

Borrowings: The carrying amounts of borrowings approximate their fair value.

Off-balance-sheet Instruments: Off-balance-sheet financial instruments consist
of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, with fair value
based on fees currently charged to enter into agreements with similar terms and
credit quality.

REGULATORY MATTERS

The Company and its banking subsidiary are subject to various regulatory capital
requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet
minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly
discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy
guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the
Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures
of the Company's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as
calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts
and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators
about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require the Company and its subsidiary bank to maintain minimum amounts and
ratios (set forth in the tables below) of total and Tier 1 Capital (as defined
in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 Capital
(as defined) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of December
31, 2000, that the Company and its subsidiary bank met all capital adequacy
requirements to which they are subject.

As of June 30, 2000, the most recent notification from the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency categorized the bank as "well-capitalized," under
the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as
"well-capitalized," the bank must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based
and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the tables below. There are no
conditions or events since that notification that management believes have
changed the institution's category. The Company's actual capital amounts and
ratios are presented in the following table:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Alliance Financial Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of condition and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Alliance Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY


     Management is responsible for preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and related financial information contained in all sections of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the determination of amounts that must
necessarily be based on judgments and estimates. It is the belief of management
that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity, in
all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate
in the circumstances and that the financial information appearing throughout
this annual report is consistent, in all material respects, with the
consolidated financial statements.

     Management depends upon the Company's system of internal accounting
controls in meeting its responsibility for reliable financial statements. This
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded
and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization
and are properly recorded.

     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of outside
directors, meets periodically with the Company's management, internal auditors
and independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, to review matters relating
to the quality of financial reporting, internal accounting control, and the
nature, extent and results of audit efforts. The internal auditors and
independent auditors have unlimited access to the Audit Committee to discuss all
such matters.

     The information required by this Item 10 is incorporated herein by
reference to the section entitled "Information Concerning Nominees for

     On January 18, 2001, the Company announced organizational changes to the
Boards of Directors of the Company and its operating subsidiary, Alliance Bank,
N.A. Boards of the Company and the Bank determined that a consolidation of the
two boards, along with a reduction in the number of the combined Board members,
would provide the opportunity for improved and more efficient corporate
governance. The combined number of Board members was reduced from 21 to 14, with
seven members retiring effective with the announcement. The consolidation
reflects the Company's original plans to reduce the number of Board members
after a successful transition period following the 1998 merger of Cortland First
Financial Corporation and Oneida Valley Bancshares, Inc.
