Defined  Benefit  Retirement and Supplemental Executive  Retirement  Plans.
AMC  sponsors  a  defined benefit retirement plan (the  "Retirement  Plan")
which  provides  benefits to certain employees of AMC and its  subsidiaries
based  upon years of credited service and the highest consecutive five-year
average  annual  remuneration  for  each  participant.   For  purposes   of
calculating  benefits, average annual compensation is  limited  by  Section
401(a)(17)  of  the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), and is  based  upon
wages,  salaries  and  other  amounts paid to  the  employee  for  personal
services,  excluding certain special compensation.  A participant  earns  a
vested right to an accrued benefit upon completion of five years of vesting
service.

      AMC also sponsors a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan to provide
the  same level of retirement benefits that would have been provided  under
the Retirement Plan had the federal tax law not been changed in the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which reduced the amount of compensation
which  can  be  taken  into  account in a qualified  retirement  plan  from
$235,840 (in 1993), the old limit, to $170,000 (in 2000).

      The following table shows the total estimated annual pension benefits
(without regard to minimum benefits) payable to a covered participant under
AMC's  Retirement  Plan  and  the Supplemental Executive  Retirement  Plan,
assuming  retirement in calendar 2000 at age 65 payable in the  form  of  a
single  life  annuity.  The benefits are not subject to any  deduction  for
Social  Security or other offset amounts.  The following table assumes  the
old limit would have been increased to $275,000 in 2000.

</TABLE>

      As  of  March  30,  2000,  the years of credited  service  under  the
Retirement Plan for each of the Named Executive Officers were: Mr. Peter C.
Brown,  nine years, Mr. Philip M. Singleton, 26 years, Mr. Richard M.  Fay,
four  years;  Mr. Richard T. Walsh, 25 years; and Mr. John D. McDonald,  25
years.

      AMC  has  established a Retirement Enhancement Plan ("REP")  for  the
benefit  of  officers who from time to time may be designated  as  eligible
participants therein by the Board of Directors.  The REP is a non-qualified
deferred  compensation  plan  designed to provide  an  unfunded  retirement
benefit  to an eligible participant in an amount equal to (i) sixty percent
(60%)  of  his  or  her average compensation (including paid  and  deferred
incentive  compensation) during the last three full  years  of  employment,
less  (ii)  the sum of (A) such participant's benefits under the Retirement
Plan  and  Social Security, and (B) the amount of a straight  life  annuity
commencing  at  the  participant's normal retirement date  attributable  to
AMC's  contributions under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan,  the
401(k)  Savings Plan, the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan and  the
Executive Savings Plan.  The base amount in clause (i) will be reduced on a
pro  rata  basis  if the participant completes fewer than twenty-five  (25)
years  of service.  The REP benefit vests upon the participant's attainment
of  age  55  or  completion of fifteen (15) years of service, whichever  is
later, and may commence to a vested participant retiring on or after age 55
(who  has  participated in the plan for at least 5 years) on an actuarially
reduced  basis  (6  2/3%  for  each  of  the  first  five  years  by  which
commencement  precedes age 65 and an additional 3 1/3%  for  each  year  by
which  commencement precedes age 60).  Benefits commence at a participant's
normal  retirement  date (i.e., the later of age 65  or  the  participant's
completion  of  five  years  of  service  with  AMC)  whether  or  not  the
participant  continues to be employed by AMC.  The accrued benefit  payable
upon  total  and  permanent disability is not reduced by  reason  of  early
commencement.  Participants become fully vested in their rights  under  the
REP  if  their employment is terminated without cause or as a result  of  a
change  in  control,  as  defined in the  REP.   No  death,  disability  or
retirement  benefit  is payable prior to a participant's  early  retirement
date  or  prior to the date any severance payments to which the participant
is entitled cease.

     Mr. Peter C. Brown, Mr. Stanley H. Durwood and Mr. Philip M. Singleton
have  been  designated as eligible to participate in the REP.   The  amount
paid  to Mr. Durwood with respect to fiscal 2000 under the REP was $345,000
and  is  not  included  in the Summary Compensation Table.   The  estimated
monthly  amounts  that  Mr. Brown and Mr. Singleton  will  be  eligible  to
receive under the REP at age 65 are $41,000 and $15,000, respectively; such
amounts   are   based  on  certain  assumptions  respecting  their   future
compensation  amounts  and  the amounts of AMC  contributions  under  other
plans.   Actual amounts received by such individuals under the REP  may  be
different than those estimated.

Compensation of Directors
     Prior  to  December  2,  1999, each of AMCE's  non-employee  directors
received  an  annual fee of $32,000 for service on the Board  of  Directors
and,  in addition, $1,500 for each Board meeting and $1,000 for each  Board
committee  meeting which they attended.  Effective December 2,  1999,  each
non-employee  director  receives  $65,000  for  service  on  the  Board  of
Directors  and, in addition, $1,500 for each Board meeting and  $1,000  for
each Board committee meeting which they attend.

     Pursuant  to  the 1999 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors,  which
was  approved by stockholders at the annual meeting in December, 1999,  the
non-employee directors are permitted to elect to receive up to all of their
annual  $65,000  fee in the form of stock options.  The number  of  options
which may be received is determined by dividing the amount of the fee taken
in  the  form  of options by 30% of the fair market value of the  Company's
Common  Stock  on  the  effective date of the grant,  which  is  the  first
business  day  after the annual meeting.  Under the plan, each non-employee
director  also received a one-time grant of options whose value  (estimated
under  the  plan for this purpose at 30% of the fair market  value  of  the
Company's  stock)  was $14,000.  Options generally become  exercisable  one
year   after   grant  and  terminate  ten  years  after  grant.    However,
exercisability is accelerated upon the occurrence of a change  in  control,
as  defined  in  the plan, death, disability or retirement  upon  or  after
reaching  age 70, and options will terminate prior to the tenth anniversary
date of grant within specified periods following termination of service  as
a  director.  Directors may elect to pay any required withholding taxes  in

issuable  under the plan is 200,000, and no director may receive more  than
50,000 shares under the plan.

Employment  Contracts,  Termination of  Employment  and  Change  in  Control
Arrangements
     Mr.  Stanley H. Durwood had an employment agreement with AMCE and  AMC
dated  January  26,  1996  retaining him as Chairman  and  Chief  Executive
Officer  and President.  It provided for an annual base salary of  no  less
than  $500,000,  plus  payments and awards under AMC's Executive  Incentive
Program  ("EIP"),  the  1994 Option and other bonus  plans  in  effect  for
Executive  Officers  at a level reflecting his position,  plus  such  other
amounts  as  may  be  paid  under  any other  compensatory  arrangement  as
determined  in  the  sole  discretion of the Compensation  Committee.   Mr.
Durwood's   annual base salary at the date of his death was $567,000.   The
Company  had also agreed to use its best efforts to provide Mr. Durwood  up
to  $5,000,000 in life insurance and to pay the premiums thereon and  taxes
resulting from such payment.  Mr. Durwood's employment agreement had a term
of  three  years and was automatically extended one year on its anniversary
date,  January  26, so that as of such date each year the agreement  had  a
three-year term.  The employment agreement was terminable without severance
if  he  engaged in intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law  or
breached  his  duty of loyalty to the Company.  The agreement provided  for
severance payments in the event of Mr. Durwood's death equal to three times
the sum of his annual base salary in effect at the time of termination plus
the  average of annual incentive or discretionary cash bonuses paid  during
the  three  fiscal  years preceding the year of termination.   The  Company
could  elect to pay such severance payments in monthly installments over  a
period of three years or in a lump sum after discounting such amount to its
then  present  value.   On July 26, 1999, the Company  paid  $1,509,000  in
settlement of Mr. Durwood's employment agreement.

     Messrs.  Peter C. Brown, Philip M. Singleton, Richard M. Fay,  Richard
T.  Walsh and John D. McDonald have entered into employment agreements with
the  Company  providing  for  annual base salaries  of  no  less  than  the
following  amounts:  Mr. Brown-$400,000; Mr. Singleton-$375,000;  Mr.  Fay-
$285,000;  Mr.  Walsh-$285,000 and Mr. McDonald-$210,000.   The  agreements
also   provide   for   discretionary  bonuses,  an  automobile   allowance,
reimbursement  of  reasonable travel and entertainment expenses  and  other
benefits  offered  from  time  to  time to other  executive  officers.  The
employment  agreements of Mr. Brown and Mr. Singleton have terms  of  three
years  and those of Mr. Fay, Mr. Walsh and Mr. McDonald have terms  of  two
years.  On the anniversary date of each agreement, one year shall be  added
to  its  term, so that each employment agreement shall always have a three-
year  or  two-year  term, as the case may be, as of each anniversary  date.
Each  employment agreement terminates generally without severance  if  such
employee  is terminated for cause, as defined in the employment  agreement,
or  upon such employee's resignation, death or disability as defined in his
employment agreement. Pro rata bonus payments will be made upon termination
by  reason of disability or death. If either Mr. Brown or Mr. Singleton  is
terminated  without cause or terminates his agreement following a  material
breach  by the Company or a change in control, as defined in the agreement,
he  will  be entitled to receive (i) a lump sum cash payment equal  to  the
lesser  of  4.5 times current base salary or 2.99 times average annual  W-2
earnings  for  the prior five years and (ii) the value of  all  outstanding
employee stock options held by such employee. If either Mr. Fay, Mr.  Walsh
or  Mr.  McDonald is terminated without cause or terminates  his  agreement
subsequent  to  specified changes in his responsibilities, base  salary  or
benefits  following a change in control, as defined in  the  agreement,  he
will be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to two years base
salary.  In  addition,  if  either Mr. Brown  or  Mr.  Singleton  dies,  is
terminated  without cause or terminates his agreement following a  material
breach  by  the  Company or a change in control, the  Company  will  redeem
shares  previously purchased by him with the proceeds of a  loan  from  the
Company.  (Mr. Brown financed the purchase of 375,000 shares  with  such  a
loan and Mr. Singleton financed the purchase of 250,000 shares with such  a
loan).  In such event, if the employee's obligations under the note to  the
Company  exceed  the  value of the stock which he acquired  with  the  note
proceeds,  the Company will forgive a portion of such excess in  an  amount
based  on a formula set forth in the agreement. The amounts payable to  the
Named  Executive  Officers  under  these  employment  agreements,  assuming
termination by reason of a change of control as of March 30, 2000  were  as
follows:  Mr. Brown-$1,094,000; Mr. Singleton-$1,375,000; Mr. Fay-$570,000;
Mr.  Walsh-$570,000; and Mr. McDonald-$480,000.  The value  of  outstanding
employee stock options payable to the Named Executive Officers under  these
employment  agreements,  assuming termination by  reason  of  a  change  of
control  as  of  March  30, 2000 were, as follows:  Mr.  Brown-$0  and  Mr.
Singleton-$0.   The  amount of note proceeds and  interest  that  would  be
forgiven  by   the Company assuming termination by reason of  a  change  of
control as of March 30, 2000 were as follows:  Mr. Brown-$4,274,000 and Mr.
Singleton-$1,963,000.

      As  permitted by the 1994 and 1999 Stock Option and Incentive  Plans,
stock  options granted to participants thereunder provide for  acceleration
upon the termination of employment within one year after the occurrence  of
certain change in control events, whether such termination is voluntary  or
involuntary,  or  with  or  without cause.  In addition,  the  Compensation
Committee   may  permit  acceleration  upon  the  occurrence   of   certain
extraordinary transactions which may not constitute a change of control.

       AMC   maintains   a  severance  pay  plan  for  full-time   salaried
nonbargaining employees with at least 90 days of service.  For an  eligible
employee  who is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA")  overtime
pay  requirements (a "nonexempt eligible employee"), the plan provides  for
severance pay in the case of involuntary termination of employment  due  to
layoff  of  the  greater of two weeks' basic pay or one  week's  basic  pay
multiplied  by  the employee's full years of service up  to  no  more  than
twelve  weeks'  basic  pay.   There is no severance  pay  for  a  voluntary
termination,  unless up to two weeks pay is authorized in lieu  of  notice.
There  is  no  severance  pay  for an involuntary  termination  due  to  an
employee's  misconduct.   Only two weeks' severance  pay  is  paid  for  an
involuntary  termination due to substandard performance.  For  an  eligible
employee  who is exempt from the FLSA overtime pay requirements,  severance
pay  is  discretionary (at the Department Head/Supervisor level), but  will
not  be  less  than  the amount that would be paid to a nonexempt  eligible
employee.
