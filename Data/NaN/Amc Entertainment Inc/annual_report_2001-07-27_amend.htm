</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;AMC sponsors a defined benefit retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan") which provides benefits to certain employees of AMC and its subsidiaries based upon years of credited service and the highest consecutive five-year average
annual remuneration for each participant. For purposes of calculating benefits, average annual compensation is limited by Section&nbsp;401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), and is based upon wages, salaries and other amounts paid to the
employee for personal services, excluding certain special compensation. A participant earns a vested right to an accrued benefit upon completion of five years of vesting service. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;AMC also sponsors a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan to provide the same level of retirement benefits that would have been provided under the Retirement Plan had the federal tax law not been changed in the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, which reduced the amount of compensation which can be taken into account in a qualified retirement plan from $235,840 (in 1993), the old limit, to $170,000 (in 2001). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The following table shows the total estimated annual pension benefits (without regard to minimum benefits) payable to a covered participant under AMC's Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, assuming
retirement in calendar 2001 at age 65, payable in the form of a single life annuity. The benefits are not subject to any deduction for Social Security or other offset amounts. The following table assumes the old limit would have been increased to $285,000
in 2001. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;/table&gt;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of March&nbsp;29, 2001, the years of credited service under the Retirement Plan for each of the Named Executive Officers were: Mr.&nbsp;Peter C. Brown, ten years; Mr.&nbsp;Philip M. Singleton, 27&nbsp;years; Mr.&nbsp;Richard M.
Fay, five years; Mr.&nbsp;Richard T. Walsh, 26&nbsp;years; and Mr.&nbsp;John D. McDonald, 26&nbsp;years. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;AMC has established a Retirement Enhancement Plan (the "REP") for the benefit of officers who from time to time may be designated as eligible participants therein by the Board of Directors. The REP is a non-qualified deferred
compensation plan designed to provide an unfunded retirement benefit to an eligible participant in an amount equal to (i)&nbsp;sixty percent (60%) of his or her average compensation (including paid and deferred incentive compensation) during the last
three full years of employment, less (ii)&nbsp;the sum of (A)&nbsp;such participant's benefits under the Retirement Plan and Social Security, and (B)&nbsp;the amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's normal retirement date
attributable to AMC's contributions under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, the 401(k) Savings Plan, the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan and the Executive Savings Plan. The base amount in clause&nbsp;(i) will be reduced on a pro rata
basis if the participant completes fewer than twenty-five (25)&nbsp;years of service. The REP benefit vests upon the participant's attainment of age 55 or completion of fifteen (15)&nbsp;years of service, whichever is later, and may commence to a vested
participant retiring on or after age 55 (who has participated in the plan for at least 5&nbsp;years) on an actuarially reduced basis (6<SUP> </SUP>2/3% for each of the first five years by which commencement precedes age 65 and an additional 3<SUP> </SUP>1/3% for each year by which commencement precedes age 60). Benefits commence at a participant's normal retirement date (i.e., the later
of age 65 or the participant's completion of five years of service with AMC) whether or not the participant continues to be employed by AMC. The accrued benefit payable upon total and permanent disability is not reduced by reason of early commencement.
Participants become fully vested in their rights under the REP if their employment is terminated without cause or as a result of a change of control, as defined in the REP. No death, disability or retirement benefit is payable prior to a participant's
early retirement date or prior to the date any severance payments to which the participant is entitled cease. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Mr.&nbsp;Peter C. Brown and Mr.&nbsp;Philip M. Singleton have been designated as eligible to participate in the REP. The estimated monthly amounts that Mr.&nbsp;Brown and Mr.&nbsp;Singleton will be eligible to receive under the REP
at age 65 are $64,000 and $19,000, respectively; such amounts are based on certain assumptions respecting their future compensation amounts and the amounts of AMC contributions under other plans. Actual amounts received by such individuals under the REP
may be different than those estimated. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change of Control Arrangements</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Messrs.&nbsp;Peter C. Brown, Philip M. Singleton, Richard M. Fay, Richard T. Walsh and John D. McDonald have entered into employment agreements with the Company, each with a term commencing as of July&nbsp;1, 2001. The
employment agreements provide for annual base salaries of no less than the following amounts: Mr.&nbsp;Brown - $625,000; Mr.&nbsp;Singleton - $425,000; Mr.&nbsp;Fay - $300,000; Mr.&nbsp;Walsh - $300,000; and Mr.&nbsp;McDonald - $275,000. The employment
agreements also provide for discretionary bonuses, an automobile allowance, reimbursement of reasonable travel and entertainment expenses and other benefits offered from time to time to other Executive Officers. The employment agreement of Mr.&nbsp;Brown
has a term of five years, that of Mr.&nbsp;Singleton has a term of three years and those of Mr.&nbsp;Fay, Mr.&nbsp;Walsh and Mr.&nbsp;McDonald have terms of two years. On the anniversary date of each employment agreement, one year shall be added to its
term, so that each employment agreement shall always have a five year, three year or two year term, as the case may be, as of each anniversary date. Each employment agreement terminates generally without severance if such employee is terminated for cause
or upon such employee's resignation, each as defined in his employment agreement. The Company will pay the employee a pro rata portion of the bonus he would otherwise be eligible to receive upon termination by reason of employee's retirement. If any of
Messrs. Fay, Walsh or McDonald dies or is terminated without cause or following his disability or terminates his agreement subsequent to specified changes in his responsibilities, annual base salary or benefits following a change of control, each as
defined in the agreement, he will be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to two years annual base salary. If either Mr. Brown or Mr. Singleton dies or is terminated without cause or following his disability or terminates his agreement for
good reason or following a change of control, each as defined in the agreement, he will be entitled to receive (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to such employee's then annual base salary for the remainder of the term of the agreement plus the bonus such
employee would be entitled to receive as if the target level had been obtained multiplied by the number of years remaining in the term of the employment agreement and (ii) a cash payment equal to the difference between (a) the value of all vested and
unvested stock options granted by the Company to employee which have an exercise price per share less than the closing price per share of the Company's Common Stock on the date of termination and (b) the exercise price of such options. In addition, the
Company will redeem shares of the Company's Common Stock previously purchased by Mr. Brown or Mr. Singleton with the proceeds of a loan from the Company. (Mr. Brown financed a purchase of 375,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock with such a loan and
Mr. Singleton financed the purchase of 250,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock with such a loan.) In such event, if the employee's obligations under the note to the Company exceed the value of the stock which he acquired with the note proceeds, the
Company will forgive a portion of such excess in an amount based upon a formula set forth in the employment agreement and also pay employee an amount equal to all taxes imposed on employee as a result of the note forgiveness. Furthermore, the Compensation
Committee has the discretion to permit the employee or his estate to retain all shares of the Company's Common Stock purchased with the proceeds of the note. The amounts payable to the Named Executive Officers under these employment agreements, assuming
termination by reason of a change of control as July&nbsp;16, 2001 were as follows: Mr.&nbsp;Brown - $5,330,000; Mr.&nbsp;Singleton - $2,055,000, Mr.&nbsp;Fay - $600,000, Mr.&nbsp;Walsh - $600,000 and Mr.&nbsp;McDonald - $550,000. The values of
outstanding employee stock options that would be payable to the Named Executive Officers under these employment agreements, assuming termination by reason of a change of control as of July&nbsp;16, 2001, were as follows: Mr.&nbsp;Brown - $1,303,726 and
Mr.&nbsp;Singleton - $791,843. The amount of note proceeds and interest that would be forgiven by the Company assuming termination by reason of a change of control as of July&nbsp;16, 2001, together with payments by the Company equal to the estimated
amount of taxes which would have been incurred by the employee as a result of the forgiveness, were as follows: Mr.&nbsp;Brown - $2,308,104 and Mr.&nbsp;Singleton - $156,426. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As permitted by the 1994 and 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plans, stock options granted to participants thereunder provide for acceleration upon the termination of employment within one year after the occurrence of certain change
of control events, whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, or with or without cause. In addition, the Compensation Committee may permit acceleration upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary transactions which may not constitute a change
of control. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;AMC maintains a severance pay plan for full-time salaried nonbargaining employees with at least 90&nbsp;days of service. For an eligible employee who is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") overtime pay requirements (a
"nonexempt eligible employee"), the plan provides for severance pay in the case of involuntary termination of employment due to layoff of the greater of two weeks' basic pay or one weeks' basic pay multiplied by the employee's full years of service up to
no more than twelve weeks' basic pay. There is no severance pay for a voluntary termination, unless up to two weeks' pay is authorized in lieu of notice. There is no severance pay for an involuntary termination due to an employee's misconduct. Only two
weeks' severance pay is paid for an involuntary termination due to substandard performance. For an eligible employee who is exempt from the FLSA overtime pay requirements, severance pay is discretionary (at the Department Head/Supervisor level), but will
not be less than the amount that would be paid to a nonexempt eligible employee. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Compensation of Directors</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Effective December&nbsp;2, 1999, each non-employee director receives $65,000 annually for service on the Board of Directors and, in addition, $1,500 for each Board meeting and $1,000 for each Board committee meeting which they
attend. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Pursuant to the Company's 1999 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (the "1999 Directors Option Plan"), the non-employee directors are permitted to elect to receive up to all of their $65,000 annual fee in the form of stock
options. The number of options which may be received is determined by dividing the amount of the fee taken in the form of options by 30% of the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the effective date of the grant, which is the first business
day after the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Under the 1999 Directors Option Plan, each non-employee director also receives a one time grant of options whose value (estimated under the 1999 Directors Option Plan for this purpose at 30% of the fair market
value of the Company's Common Stock) is $14,000. Options generally become exercisable one year after grant and terminate ten years after grant. However, exercisability is accelerated upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company, as defined in
the 1999 Directors Option Plan, or such director's death, disability or retirement from service as a director upon or after reaching age 70, and options will terminate prior to the tenth anniversary of the date of grant within specified periods following
termination of service as a director. Directors may elect to pay any required withholding taxes in connection with the exercise of an option by having the Company withhold shares otherwise issuable upon exercise. The maximum number of shares issuable
under the 1999 Directors Option Plan is 200,000 and no director may receive more than 50,000 shares under the 1999 Directors Option Plan. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;29, 2001, the non-employee directors received the following for their service as directors under the Company's compensation arrangements for non-employee directors: Mr.&nbsp;Charles J. Egan,
Jr., $78,500; 0 options; Mr.&nbsp;W. Thomas Grant, II, $60,607; 23,660 options; Mr.&nbsp;Paul E. Vardeman, $64,000; 14,010 options; and Charles S. Paul, $58,607; 23,660 options. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<SUP>(1)</SUP>The Company's Class&nbsp;B Stock is held of record by the Durwood Voting Trust established under that certain 1992 Durwood,&nbsp;Inc. Voting Trust Agreement dated December&nbsp;12, 1992, as amended and restated as of
August&nbsp;12, 1997. Beneficial interests in the Durwood Voting Trust are held by a trust established under a Revocable Trust Agreement of Mr.&nbsp;Stanley H. Durwood dated August&nbsp;14, 1989, as amended and restated as of May&nbsp;12, 1999 (the
"Revocable Trust") and by the Pamela Yax Durwood Marital Trust created pursuant to the above described Revocable Trust Agreement (the "Marital Trust"). The Trustees of the Durwood Voting Trust and of the Revocable Trust are Mr.&nbsp;Raymond F. Beagle,
Jr., the Company's general counsel, and Mr.&nbsp;Charles J. Egan, Jr., a Director of the Company. The Trustee of the Marital Trust is Mr.&nbsp;Charles J. Egan, Jr. As Trustees, Messrs.&nbsp;Beagle and Egan share voting and investment power over all
outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock and may be deemed to beneficially own all of such shares. (Although Mr.&nbsp;Egan is the sole trustee of the Marital Trust, Mr.&nbsp;Beagle shares the power to dispose of the shares in which the Marital Trust has a
beneficial interest because under the terms of the Voting Trust, the Voting Trust trustees must approve any transfer of shares held in the Voting Trust). Each of Messrs.&nbsp;Beagle and Egan disclaims beneficial ownership of any of such shares
attributable to him solely by reason of his position as Trustee. Under the terms of the Durwood Voting Trust, the Trustees (or their successors and any additional trustees whom they might appoint) have all voting powers with respect to shares held
therein, and exercise such rights by majority vote. Unless otherwise terminated or extended in accordance with its terms, the Durwood Voting Trust will terminate in 2030. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The 4,041,993 shares of the Company's Class&nbsp;B Stock constitute 100% of the outstanding shares of such class. Pursuant to the Company's Restated and Amended Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of the Company's Class&nbsp;
B Stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters that are voted upon as a class by the holders of the Company's Common Stock, Class&nbsp;B Stock and, if applicable, Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock entitled to be voted on an as converted basis.
Shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock are convertible into Common Stock on a share-for-share basis at any time at the option of the holder. As of July&nbsp;16, 2001, the shares of the Company's Class&nbsp;B Stock and Common Stock held by the Durwood Voting Trust
represent 66.7% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding stock, other than in the election of directors or in matters reserved for a class vote by the holders of the Company's Common Stock or Class&nbsp;B Stock. This percentage includes
approximately 772,027 votes attributable to the shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock held by the Sandler Funds (see Note <SUP>(3)</SUP>), which are entitled to vote on an "as converted" basis with the Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Stock on certain matters. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The voting control of the Trustees may be diluted if the Trustees are required to dispose of shares to honor provisions of the Revocable Trust or the Marital Trust or otherwise. Other factors which may substantially dilute the
voting control of the Trustees include, but are not limited to, the following: (1)&nbsp;the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock by the Company, including under the Company's employee benefit plans; (2)&nbsp;the transfer by the Apollo Purchasers
of shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock to persons who may be entitled to vote such shares on an "as-converted" basis; (3)&nbsp;the conversion of shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock into Common Stock; and (4)&nbsp;the exchange of Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Stock for Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock. If all Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock is exchanged for Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock, the Class&nbsp;B Stock would represent 42.4% of the total voting power (other than in the election of directors) of all
outstanding stock of the Company, assuming all of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock is either converted to Common Stock or held by persons entitled to vote such stock on an as converted basis. See Notes&nbsp;<SUP>(2)</SUP>,<SUP>(3)</SUP> for information regarding limitations on the conversion rights of certain holders of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<SUP>(2)</SUP>Beneficial ownership is as reported in Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to Schedule&nbsp;13D dated as of July&nbsp;3, 2001. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As used herein, "Initial Apollo Purchasers" means Apollo Investment Fund IV, L.P. and Apollo Overseas Partners IV, L.P. (collectively, the "Apollo IV Purchasers"), Apollo Investment Fund V, L.P. and Apollo Overseas Partners V, L.P.
(collectively, the "Apollo V Purchasers"). "Apollo" means Apollo Management IV, L.P., in its capacity as investment manager of the Apollo IV Purchasers ("Apollo IV Management"), and Apollo Management V, L.P., in its capacity as investment manager to the
Apollo V Purchasers ("Apollo V Management"), together with their affiliates. According to their Schedule&nbsp;13D filed on April&nbsp;20, 2001, Apollo Advisors IV, L.P. is the general partner of Apollo Investment Fund IV, L.P. and the managing general
partner of Apollo Overseas Partners IV, L.P., and Apollo Advisors V, L.P. is the general partner of Apollo Investment Fund V, L.P. and the managing general partner of Apollo Overseas Partners V, L.P. The foregoing parties identified in this paragraph,
together with AP&nbsp;Entertainment LLC, are referred to collectively as the "Apollo Group." </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Pursuant to an Investment Agreement dated April&nbsp;19, 2001, the Initial Apollo Purchasers acquired 92,000 shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and 158,000 share of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock from the Company. According to
Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to Schedule&nbsp;13D of the Initial Apollo Purchasers filed on July&nbsp;3, 2001, on June&nbsp;29, 2001 the Initial Apollo Purchasers sold 3,680 shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and 6,320 shares of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock
to AP Entertainment LLC, a vehicle formed for the purpose of holding the Company's securities that is managed by Apollo V Management. On July&nbsp;3, 2001, the Initial Apollo Purchasers sold 5,520 shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and 9,480 shares
of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock to the Sandler Funds. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;After giving effect to these transactions, the Apollo Group owns 87,722 shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and 152,312 shares of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock provide that each
share is convertible into 139.86 shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment. Presently, these shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock are convertible into an aggregate of 12,268,811 shares of Common Stock, or 38.7% of the shares of such class giving
effect only to such conversion. At the next annual meeting of stockholders ("Annual Meeting"), the Company will seek stockholder approval of an amendment to its Restated and Amended Certificate of Incorporation that will increase the number of shares of
Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue (the "Amendment"). If the Amendment is approved, to the extent such an exchange will not result in a change in control under the Indentures, the 152,312 shares of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock will be
automatically exchanged for 152,312 shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock. These 152,312 shares of Series A Preferred Stock would be convertible into an additional 21,302,377 shares of Common Stock, which, together with the 12,268,811 shares of Common
Stock referred to above, would represent 63.3% of the shares of such class, giving effect only to such conversion. However, pursuant to an agreement between the Company and certain members of the Apollo Group, members of the Apollo Group may not convert
their shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock into Common Stock, except in connection with a disposition of such shares, before April&nbsp;20, 2006. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Regular dividends on the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock are payable at the annual rate of 6.75% per annum and must be paid with additional shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock through April&nbsp;19, 2004 (the "PIK Period").
Thereafter, dividends on shares of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock may be paid in cash or shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock, at the Company's option, through April&nbsp;19, 2008. Assuming that the Amendment to the Restated and Amended Certificate
of Incorporation referred to above is approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, by the end of the PIK Period the Apollo Purchasers might hold an aggregate of 289,506 shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock. Based on the current
conversion price of $7.15 per share of Common Stock, assuming full conversion of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock for Common Stock at the end of the PIK Period, the Apollo Purchasers would hold an aggregate of 40,490,349 shares of Common Stock at the end
of such period. However, pursuant to an agreement between the Company and certain members of the Apollo Group, members of the Apollo Group may not convert their shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock into Common Stock, except in connection with a
disposition of such shares, before April&nbsp;20, 2006. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Apollo and the Apollo Purchasers are bound by a Standstill Agreement with the Company which, for a period of five years ending April&nbsp;19, 2006 (the "Standstill Period"), among other matters, restricts their ability to (i)&nbsp;
acquire additional voting securities of the Company, (ii)&nbsp;propose certain extraordinary corporate transactions, (iii)&nbsp;seek to elect or remove members of the Board of Directors or (iv)&nbsp;engage in election contests. Further, if during the
Standstill Period an Apollo Purchaser wishes to convert Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock to Common Stock it may do so only in connection with a permitted disposition under the Standstill Agreement. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Until such time as the Apollo Purchasers no longer beneficially own 50% of the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Investment Agreement (reduced by the shares sold on July&nbsp;3, 2001 to the
Sandler Funds) or either Apollo is terminated as investment manager of the Apollo Purchasers or an Apollo affiliate is removed as the general partner of the Apollo Purchasers and, in either case, is not replaced by another Apollo affiliate, (i)&nbsp;
Apollo's approval is required with respect to certain corporate actions, including, generally, amending the Company's Restated and Amended Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, creating, issuing or purchasing capital stock, paying cash dividends,
prepaying indebtedness, incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers with other companies, engaging in certain affiliate transactions, changing the size of the Board of Directors or acquiring significant assets and (ii)&nbsp;Apollo Purchasers that are
holders of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, acting as a single class, are entitled to elect three members of the Company's Board of Directors. Pursuant to an Investment Agreement between the Company, Apollo and the Initial
Apollo Purchasers, the Apollo Purchasers have agreed that so long as they hold shares of Preferred Stock and the Apollo Purchasers have Preferred Stock Approval Rights, Apollo Investment Fund IV and Apollo Investment Fund V shall be entitled to elect two
of the three directors, with each being entitled to elect one of the two so long as it holds Preferred Shares. The third director is to be elected collectively by all Apollo Purchasers. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In their Schedule&nbsp;13D filed on April&nbsp;20, 2001, as amended on July&nbsp;3, 2001, each member of the Apollo Group reported that it shared the power to dispose of the shares reported therein as beneficially owned but stated
that, in light of its agreement in the Investment Agreement not to convert shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock into Common Stock from April&nbsp;20, 2001 until April&nbsp;20, 2006 except in connection with the disposition of such Common Stock to an
unaffiliated third party, notwithstanding the right to elect directors, such person has no ability to exercise voting power with respect to the Common Stock following conversion during such time period. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<SUP>(3)</SUP>These shares were acquired by Sandler Capital Partners&nbsp;V, L.P., Sandler Capital Partners&nbsp;V FTE, L.P., and Sandler Capital Partners&nbsp;V Germany, L.P. on July&nbsp;3, 2001 from the Initial Apollo
Purchasers. Sandler Capital Management, Sandler Investment Partners, L.P. and MJDM Corp. are general partners of each of the purchasers, which purchasers are referred to collectively as the Sandler Funds in Note&nbsp;<SUP>(2)</SUP>. Pursuant to the agreement under which the Sandler Funds acquired the shares of Preferred Stock from the Initial Apollo Purchasers, the Sandler Funds are subject to restrictions similar to those to which the Apollo Purchasers are subject.
Generally, without the Company's consent, the Sandler Funds may not convert their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock before April 20, 2006, except in connection with a disposition of such shares, and may not transfer their shares of
Series B Preferred Stock before October 19, 2002. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company seeks to ensure that all transactions with related parties are fair, reasonable and in the best interest of the Company. In this regard, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company reviews all
material proposed transactions between the Company and related parties to determine that, in their best business judgment, such transactions meet that standard. The Company believes that each of these transactions was on terms at least as favorable to the
Company as could have been obtained from an unaffiliated third party. Set forth below is a description of significant transactions which have occurred since March&nbsp;31, 2000 or which involve obligations that remain outstanding as of July&nbsp;16, 2001. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In connection with the 1997 merger of the Company and Durwood,&nbsp;Inc. ("DI"), the Company agreed to pay Mr.&nbsp;Stanley H. Durwood's estate any credit amounts arising after March&nbsp;31, 2000 that result from net tax benefits
realized by the Company from the utilization by the Company of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and Missouri operating loss carryforwards of DI. The maximum amount of credit amounts that could be paid to Mr.&nbsp;Durwood's estate is
approximately $1,100,000. At this time, the Company has not realized any of DI's net tax benefits on the tax returns it has filed since 1998. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As a Successor Trustee of the Voting Trust with shared voting powers over shares held in the Durwood Voting Trust, Mr.&nbsp;Raymond F. Beagle, Jr. may be deemed to beneficially own in excess of 5% of the Company's voting
securities. Mr.&nbsp;Beagle serves as general counsel to the Company under a three year retainer agreement which provides for annual payments of $400,000. On each anniversary date of the retainer agreement, one year will be added to the term so that as of
each anniversary date the retainer agreement will have a three year term. The agreement provides for severance payments upon a change of control or termination (other than upon resignation or retirement or for cause) equal to the annual payments for the
remaining term. The agreement also provides for deferred payments from a previously established rabbi trust in a formula amount ($35,623 monthly as of July&nbsp;16, 2001, which amount reflects a $150,000 discretionary deferred bonus which has been paid to
the rabbi trust during fiscal 2002), for a period of twelve years after termination of services or a change of control. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Pursuant to a program recommended by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Company's Board of Directors, the Company loaned Mr.&nbsp;Peter C. Brown $5,625,000 to purchase 375,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock.
Mr.&nbsp;Brown purchased such shares on August&nbsp;11, 1998. Under such program the Company also loaned Mr.&nbsp;Philip M. Singleton $3,765,000 to purchase 250,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. Mr.&nbsp;Singleton purchased such shares from
September&nbsp;11 to September&nbsp;15, 1998 and unused proceeds of $811,000 were repaid to the Company, leaving a remaining unpaid principal balance of $2,954,000. Such loans are unsecured and bear interest at a rate at least equal to the applicable
federal rate prescribed by Section&nbsp;1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code in effect on the date of such loan (6% per annum for the loans to Messrs.&nbsp;Brown and Singleton). Interest on these loans accrues and is added to principal annually on the
anniversary date of such loan, and the full principal amount and all accrued interest is due and payable on the fifth anniversary of such loan. On July&nbsp;16, 2001, the principal amount of the loan to Mr.&nbsp;Brown was $6,270,000 and the principal
amount of the loan to Mr.&nbsp;Singleton was $3,292,000. Accrued interest on the loans as of July&nbsp;16, 2001 was $477,600. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Periodically, the Company and DI or Delta Properties,&nbsp;Inc. ("Delta"), a former subsidiary of DI, reconciled any amounts owed by one company to the other. Charges to the intercompany account have included payments made by the
Company on behalf of DI or Delta. The largest balance owed by DI or Delta to the Company during fiscal 2001 was $11,322. This balance was reimbursed by Delta on June&nbsp;7, 2000. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During fiscal 1998, the Company sold the real estate assets associated with 13 theatres to Entertainment Properties Trust ("EPT"), a real estate investment trust, for an aggregate purchase price of $283,800,000. The Company leased
the real estate assets associated with the theatres from EPT pursuant to non-cancelable operating leases with terms ranging from 13 to 15&nbsp;years at an initial lease rate of 10.5% with options to extend for up to an additional 20&nbsp;years. (Such
sales and leases being referred to herein collectively as the "Sale and Lease Back Transaction"). The Company leases four additional theatres from EPT under the same terms as those included in the Sale and Lease Back Transaction. Annual rentals for these
four theatres are based on an estimated fair value of $102,600,000 for the theatres. In addition, for a period of five years subsequent to November&nbsp;1997, EPT has a right of first refusal and first offer to purchase and lease back to the Company the
real estate assets associated with any theatre and related entertainment property owned or ground-leased by the Company, exercisable upon the Company's intended disposition of such property. Mr.&nbsp;Peter C. Brown, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer, President and a Director of the Company, is also the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of EPT. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Lathrop&nbsp;&amp; Gage L.C., a law firm of which Mr.&nbsp;Raymond F. Beagle, Jr. is a member, renders legal services to the Company and its subsidiaries. During fiscal 2001, the Company paid Lathrop&nbsp;&amp; Gage L.C. $3,252,000
for such services. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On April&nbsp;19, 2001, the Initial Apollo Purchasers purchased 92,000 shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and 158,000 shares of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $250&nbsp;million. In accordance
with the Investment Agreement pursuant to which the shares were purchased, the Company paid Apollo a fee of $8.75&nbsp;million and paid Apollo's transaction expenses of $3.75&nbsp;million. The Company has entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with
the Initial Apollo Purchasers in which it has given the Apollo Purchasers and their permitted transferees demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock held by them. The Company has consented to the
assignment by the Initial Apollo Purchasers to the Sandler Funds of registration rights with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock (and underlying shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock) sold by the Initial Apollo
Purchasers to the Sandler Funds. </P>
