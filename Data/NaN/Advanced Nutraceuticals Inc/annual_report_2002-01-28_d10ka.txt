Compensation Committee Report
-----------------------------

  The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors has
been established by the Board to periodically review the compensation philosophy
for the Company's executives, and to recommend to the Board compensation
packages for the Company's executives. The Committee also reviews and recommends
to the Board any additions to or revisions of the Company's stock option plans.
The Committee consists exclusively of non-employee directors, appointed by
resolution of the entire Board.

  The Committee's objective is to set executive compensation at levels which (i)
are fair and reasonable to the shareholders, (ii) link executive compensation to
long-term and short-term interest of the shareholders, and (iii) are sufficient
to attract, motivate and retain outstanding individuals for executive positions.

  Fairness to the shareholders is balanced with the need to attract, retain and
motivate outstanding individuals by comparing the Company's executive
compensation with the compensation of executives at other companies. The
Committee's overall goal is to achieve strong performance by the Company and its
executives by affording the executives the opportunity to be rewarded for strong
performance. The Committee attempts to provide both short-term and long-term
incentive pay. To accomplish its objectives, the Committee has structured the
executive compensation program with three primary components. These primary
components are base salary, annual incentives, and long-term incentives.

  In late 1999, the Company finalized acquisitions of three companies. In
connection with those acquisitions, the Company entered into employment
agreements with the officers of those companies, Gregory Pusey, Barry Loder,
Pailla Reddy, Neil Sirkin and Allan Sirkin, to continue serving as officers.

  As a result of the Company's worsening financial condition, in September 2000,
Mr. Bertrand, Ms. Mitcham, Mr. Pusey and Mr. Loder, as well as Jeff McGonegal,
the Company's Senior Vice President of Finance, agreed to terminate their
respective employment agreements or arrangements and to substantial reductions
in their salaries.

  The Committee periodically reviews executive salaries. In addition to the
external competitive compensation market, base salary levels reflect each
officer's performance over time and each individual's role in the Company.
Consequently, employees with higher levels of sustained performance over time
and/or employees assuming greater responsibilities will typically be paid
correspondingly higher salaries. Individual performance criteria used to assess
performance include leadership, professionalism, initiative and dependability.
However, individual performance assessments are made qualitatively and in total,
and no specific weightings are attached to these performance indicators, nor is
a formula utilized in determining appropriate salary increases or salary levels.

<PAGE>

  The Committee periodically reviews the performance of executive officers to
determine whether bonuses should be paid to those persons. The Committee has not
established specific performance measures for determining the award of bonuses.
The Committee believes that bonuses should be provided to reward key employees
based on Company and individual performance and to provide competitive cash
compensation opportunities to the Company's executives. During June 2001,
following the closing of the sale of NFLI, bonuses of $75,000, $50,000 and
$30,000 were paid to Messrs. Bertrand, Pusey and McGonegal, respectively. In
September 2001, a bonus of 103,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock (valued
at $97,850) was approved for Dr. Reddy, and the shares were issued subsequent to
the fiscal year-end.

  The Company's stock option plans are designed to focus executive efforts on
long-term goals of the Company and to maximize total return to the Company's
shareholders. The Committee believes that stock options advance the interests of
employees and shareholders by providing value to the executives through stock
price appreciation only. Options terminate if the employee's employment with the
Company is terminated. All options awarded must have an exercise price of at
least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant.

  The exact number of shares actually granted to a particular participant
reflects both the participant's performance and role in the Company, as well as
the Company's financial success, and its future business plans. All of these
factors are assessed subjectively and are not weighted. In determining each
grant, the Committee also considers the number of stock options, which are
outstanding, and the total number of options to be awarded.

  In making grants during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the
Committee also considered the number of outstanding options previously granted
to each officer. Due to the decline in the Company's stock price during the
year, all of the options granted to executive officers of the Company in fiscal
2001 were "out-of-the-money" at the fiscal year end of September 30, 2001. The
Committee believes that its awards were consistent with the Company's
compensation philosophy to increase the emphasis placed on long-term incentives
and to be competitive in its total compensation program.

  Under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, public
companies are precluded from receiving a tax deduction on compensation paid to
executive officers in excess of $1,000,000, unless the compensation is excluded
from the $1,000,000 limit as a result of being classified performance- based. At
this time, the Company's executive officers cash compensation levels do not
exceed the payment limit and will most likely not be affected by the regulations
in the near future. Nonetheless, the Committee intends to review its executive
pay plans over time in light of these regulations.

                                    COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

                                    F. Wayne Ballenger
                                    M. F. Florence

Compensation of Directors
-------------------------

  Effective in November 2001, the Company's policy is paying Directors who are
not employees of the Company $12,000 per year. Prior to November 2001, Directors
received $18,000 per year, $400 for each Board meeting attended, and $200 for
each committee meeting attended. Directors who are also employees of the Company
receive no additional compensation for serving as Directors. The Company
reimburses its Directors for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection
with their attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors.

  During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the Company granted options
to purchase 12,500 shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.16 per share to F.
Wayne Ballenger, 12,500 shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.16 per share to
M.F. Florence, and 12,500 shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.26 per share
to Randall D. Humphreys. The option grants were made pursuant to the Company's
1995 Stock Option Plan, as amended. Each option will expire ten years from the
date of grant, except that an option will expire, if not exercised, 30 days
after the optionee ceases to be a consultant to the Company.
