Compensation Committee Report
-----------------------------

The compensation committee (the "Committee") of the Board has been established
by the Board to periodically review the compensation philosophy for our
executives, and to recommend to the Board compensation packages for our
executives. The Committee also reviews and recommends to the Board any additions
to or revisions of our stock option plans. The Committee consists exclusively of
non-employee directors, appointed by resolution of the entire Board.

The Committee's objective is to set executive compensation at levels which (i)
are fair and reasonable to the shareholders, (ii) link executive compensation to
long-term and short-term interest of the shareholders, and (iii) are sufficient
to attract, motivate and retain outstanding individuals for executive positions.

<PAGE>
Fairness to the shareholders is balanced with the need to attract, retain and
motivate outstanding individuals by comparing our executive compensation with
the compensation of executives at other companies. The Committee's overall goal
is to achieve strong performance by the Company and its executives by affording
the executives the opportunity to be rewarded for strong performance. The
Committee attempts to provide both short-term and long-term incentive pay. To
accomplish its objectives, the Committee has structured the executive
compensation program with three primary components. These primary components are
base salary, annual incentives, and long-term incentives.

The Committee periodically reviews executive salaries. In addition to the
external competitive compensation market, base salary levels reflect each
officer's performance over time and each individual's role in the Company.
Consequently, employees with higher levels of sustained performance over time
and/or employees assuming greater responsibilities will typically be paid
correspondingly higher salaries. Individual performance criteria used to assess
performance include leadership, professionalism, initiative and dependability.
However, individual performance assessments are made qualitatively and in total,
and no specific weightings are attached to these performance indicators, nor is
a formula utilized in determining appropriate salary increases or salary levels.
Information regarding salary levels is included in the Executive Compensation
Table.

The Committee periodically reviews the performance of executive officers to
determine whether bonuses should be paid to those persons. The Committee has not
established specific performance measures for determining the award of bonuses.
The Committee believes that bonuses should be provided to reward key employees
based on Company and individual performance and to provide competitive cash
compensation opportunities to the Company's executives. During June 2001,
following the closing of the sale of NFLI, bonuses of $75,000, $50,000 and
$30,000 were paid to Messrs. Bertrand, Pusey and McGonegal, respectively. In
September 2001, a bonus of 103,000 shares of our common stock (valued at
$97,850) was approved for Dr. Reddy, and the shares were issued subsequent to
the fiscal year-end. During the year ended September 30, 2003, bonuses of
$9,615, $4,808 and $20,769 were paid to Messrs. Reddy, Pusey and McGonegal,
respectively.

Our stock option plans are designed to focus executive efforts on our long-term
goals and to maximize total return to our shareholders. The Committee believes
that stock options advance the interests of employees and shareholders by
providing value to the executives through stock price appreciation only. Options
terminate if the employee's employment with us is terminated. All options
awarded must have an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the
date of grant.

The exact number of shares actually granted to a particular participant reflects
both the participant's performance and role in the Company, as well as our
financial success, and our future business plans. All of these factors are
assessed subjectively and are not weighted. In determining each grant, the
Committee also considers the number of stock options which are outstanding, and
the total number of options to be awarded.

<PAGE>
In making grants during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Committee
also considered the number of outstanding options previously granted to each
officer. The Committee believes that its awards were consistent with our
compensation philosophy to increase the emphasis placed on long-term incentives
and to be competitive in its total compensation program.

Under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, public
companies are precluded from receiving a tax deduction on compensation paid to
executive officers in excess of $1,000,000, unless the compensation is excluded
from the $1,000,000 limit as a result of being classified performance-based. At
this time, our executive officers cash compensation levels do not exceed the
payment limit and will most likely not be affected by the regulations in the
near future. Nonetheless, the Committee intends to review its executive pay
plans over time in light of these regulations.

                                            COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

                                              F. Wayne Ballenger
                                              Randall D. Humphreys

Compensation of Directors
-------------------------

Effective in November 2001, our policy is to pay directors who are not employees
of the Company $12,000 per year. Prior to November 2001, directors received
$18,000 per year, $400 for each Board meeting attended, and $200 for each
committee meeting of the Board attended. Directors who are also employees of the
Company receive no additional compensation for serving as directors. We
reimburse our directors for expenses incurred for attendance at meetings of the
Board.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, we granted options to purchase
12,500 shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.16 per share to F. Wayne
Ballenger, 12,500 shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.16 per share to M.F.
Florence, and 12,500 shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.26 per share to
Randall D. Humphreys. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, we
granted options to each of these non-employee directors to purchase 10,000
shares of Common Stock at a price of $.46 per share. During the year ended
September 30, 2003, we granted options to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock
at a price of $.63 per share to David E. Welch, upon his becoming a director of
the Company. During the year ended September 30, 2003, M. F. Florence resigned
from the Board and his options have now expired. The option grants were made
pursuant to the Company's 1995 Stock Option Plan, as amended. Each option will
expire ten years from the date of grant, except that an option will expire, if
not exercised, 30 days after the optionee ceases to be a consultant to the
Company. Each grant was made at an expense price equivalent to the trading price
of the Common Stock at the date of grant.

            ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS


Bactolac, headquartered in Hauppauge, New York, conducts its operations in a
facility leased from its President, Pailla M. Reddy, comprising approximately
32,700 square feet. Bactolac's current monthly rental is approximately $30,000,
of which $6,000 pertains to improvements made by an entity owned by Dr. Reddy,
that escalates over the remaining term on the lease through December 2010.
Bactolac has a five-year renewal option on the facility.

<PAGE>
During March 2003, the remaining $500,000 Note payable to Dr. P. M. Reddy, was
repaid. The Note arose from the November 1999, purchase of Bactolac.

During March 2003, Bactolac and Dr. Reddy entered into an amended employment
agreement extending to November 1, 2005. In addition to a base annual salary of
$250,000, and performance bonus features, the agreement contains customary
confidentiality and benefit provisions.

In February 2003 the Company entered into an employment agreement with Jeffrey
G. McGonegal, Senior Vice President for a two year term under which he currently
receives an annual salary of $150,000 and may receive a performance bonus at the
Company's discretion

During January 2002, the Company borrowed $250,000 from Cambridge Holdings, Ltd.
The 7% note was scheduled to mature in one year, and was convertible at the
option of the holder into shares of ANI Common Stock at $1.00 per share, which
conversion subsequently occurred. The Company also issued a warrant to allow
Cambridge to acquire 50,000 shares of ANI Common Stock at $1.00 per share,
through June 2004. Greg Pusey and Jeff McGonegal, officers of the Company, are
also officers and directors of Cambridge. These transactions were approved by a
disinterested majority of the Company's Board and the Board believes that the
terms are at least as favorable as could have been obtained from an unaffiliated
party.


ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES

During fiscal 2002 and 2003, we retained our principal auditor, Grant Thornton
LLP ("GT"), to provide services. On September 10, 2003, the Company dismissed GT
and on September 12, 2003 the Company engaged Gelfond Hochstadt Pangburn, P. C.
as principal auditor. Aggregate fees were billed in the following categories and
amounts:

          Other Fees                             7,600            8,778

Other fees for 2003 and 2002 related to 401(k) plan audits. All of the services
described above were approved by the Company's audit committee and prior to
performance. The audit committee has determined that the payments made to its
independent accountants for these services are compatible with maintaining such
auditors' independence.
