Item 1.   Business
          General developments of business.

                Incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1945, Allen Organ  Company  and
          Subsidiaries  ("Company") operate in four industry segments:  Musical
          Instruments,  Data  Communications, Electronic Assemblies  and  Audio
          Equipment.
                During 2002 the Company's Data Communications segment increased
          its  sales  and  operating results when compared to 2001.   This  was
          mainly   the  result  of  new  product  introductions,  cost  cutting
          initiated  in  previous  years,  and  from  the  redirection  of  the
          Company's  sales  and marketing efforts away from  Competitive  Local
          Exchange Carriers (CLEC's) to other Data Communications markets.  The
          Company  continues  to  be cautious because the  Data  Communications
          industry  remains in a long recession and the general  weak  economic
          environment.   Future sales in this segment have become  increasingly
          dependent  on  larger sales opportunities that could  result  in  the
          amount and timing of future revenue being more volatile.
                The  economic  downturn has negatively affected  the  Company's
          Electronic  Assemblies  segment as well resulting  in  a  significant
          reduction  in its order rate in 2002.  Management expects this  lower
          order rate to continue into future quarters.
                While  there  are  many factors that may affect  the  Company's
          future business, the Company is particularly concerned with the  weak
          economic  environment  that may alter or delay  customers  purchasing
          decisions in any of the four industry segments that it operates.

          Industry segments.

                 The  Company  operates  in  four  industry  segments:  Musical
          Instruments,  Data  Communications, Electronic Assemblies  and  Audio
          Equipment.   For financial information concerning the  segments,  see
          Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

          Description of business.

              Musical Instruments.

                Allen  Organ  Company is a leading manufacturer  of  electronic
          keyboard  musical  instruments, primarily digital  electronic  church
          organs and accessories.  This segment accounted for 37%, 40% and  39%
          of net sales in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
                The  principal  market for the Musical Instruments  segment  is
          institutions, primarily churches.  Sales to the home market make up a
          smaller  portion  of this segment's sales.  Musical  Instruments  are
          distributed  mostly  through  dealers, primarily  independent  retail
          music  stores throughout the United States, with a lesser  percentage
          distributed through dealers internationally.  The segment's  business
          is not seasonal.
                The principal raw materials used in the segment's products  are
          electronic  components and wood, all of which are  readily  available
          from various sources without undue difficulty.  Traditionally, organs
          have  longer  service requirements than other digital  products.   As
          life  cycles for electronic components have shortened in recent years
          the  Company  has had to redesign some circuit boards to satisfy  the
          needs of current and past customers.  At the present time, management
          does  not  expect this issue to significantly affect  future  product
          shipments.
                This  segment  does  not engage in any significant  amounts  of
          consignments,  extended  payment terms,  or  lease  guarantees.   The
          Company  is contingently liable in connection with certain customers'
          financing  arrangements  (see Note 12 to the  Consolidated  Financial
          Statements).  The dollar amounts and number of times the Company  has
          had to honor these repurchase agreements are negligible.
                The  Musical Instruments segment is not dependent on any single
          or  small group of customers, the loss of which would have a material
          adverse  effect on the business.  The dollar amount of the  segment's
          unshipped order backlog at the end of February 2003 and 2002 was $4.2
          million  and $5.2 million, respectively.  All orders are expected  to
          be filled in the current year.
                The electronic organ industry is competitive involving at least
          five (5) domestic and foreign companies.  In addition, there are many
          small  pipe  organ companies in the institutional organ market.   The
          organ   market   consists  of  two  basic  divisions,   institutional
          (primarily churches) and home or entertainment.  Management  believes
          it  has  a  major position in the institutional market in the  United
          States  (largest  world  market) because of product  performance  and
          competitive  prices,  and  a  smaller  percentage  of  the  home   or
          entertainment market.

                Data Communications.

                The  Data  Communications segment consists of Eastern Research,
          Inc.  (ERI). During 2001 the Company combined the operations  of  VIR
          Linear Switch with ERI.  The combined operations are headquartered at
          ERI's  facility in Moorestown, New Jersey.  ERI designs  and  markets
          data  networking  products  enabling  network  service  providers  to
          deliver services to their customers.  This segment accounted for 54%,
          43% and 46% of net sales in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
                Data Communications products are sold directly to end-users, to
          wholesale  and retail distributors worldwide and to a smaller  extent
          under  OEM agreements with some customers.  The segment maintains  an
          inventory  of  in-process  and finished  goods  to  allow  for  rapid
          fulfillment of customer orders that is expected in the industry.
                The  principal  raw  materials used in the Data  Communications
          products are electronic components, which are readily available  from
          various  sources  without  undue  difficulty.   As  life  cycles  for
          electronic components have shortened in recent years, the Company has
          had  to  redesign some circuit boards to satisfy the needs of current
          and  past customers.  At the present time, management does not expect
          this to significantly affect future product shipments.
                The  Data  Communications segment derived 40% of its net  sales
          from two customers in 2002 and 13% and 16% of its net sales from  one
          customer in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
                ERI's  customer  base  includes  major  end-user  corporations,
          Network  Service  Providers,  Wireless  Service  Providers,  Internet
          Service   Providers  and  systems  integrators.    There   are   many
          competitors  in this market that is dominated by several  large  data
          communications companies, such as Adtran, Tellabs and  Alcatel.   The
          Company's  strategy  has been to target market niches  with  products
          that provide new features and packaging with attractive pricing.
                ERI initially built its business in the CSU/DSU market and also
          developed  router technology products.  In 1997, ERI  introduced  its
          multi-service access concentrator (DNX) family of products.  ERI  has
          expanded  this  product  family and broadened  its  feature  set  and
          considers  the DNX its flagship product.  The DNX revenues  represent
          approximately  89%  of  ERI's  net  sales  for  2002.   To   properly
          capitalize  on  this  market's  opportunities,  ERI  has  implemented
          aggressive marketing strategies and product development work and will
          continue  to do so in a way that takes into account ERI's  needs  and
          the current economic environment.
               ERI markets the VIR Linear Switch products that consist of patch
          and testing equipment, often referred to as tech control products and
          test access equipment.  These products are of varying complexity  and
          are  used  to connect, switch, test and trouble shoot data  lines  in
          large computer installations.
                This segment derived approximately 28% and 13% of its net sales
          from  international markets in 2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily
          from  Asia  Pacific and Europe.  ERI will continue to  pursue  growth
          opportunities in markets outside the United States.  The  realization
          of  future  business  from  these opportunities  could  be  adversely
          affected  by  currency fluctuations, social and political  risks  and
          changes in foreign economies.
                The  dollar  amount of unshipped order backlog at  the  end  of
          February   2003   and  2002  was  $2.0  million  and   $3.0   million
          respectively.   All orders are expected to be filled in  the  current
          year.
                This segment has redirected its sales and marketing efforts  to
          focus on markets for which its product line is well suited, including
          the   wireless,  enterprise,  government  and  certain  international
          markets.   This segment has been successful in increasing  its  sales
          and  operating income during 2002.  Future sales in this segment have
          become  increasingly  dependent on larger  sales  opportunities  that
          could  result in the amount and timing of future revenue  being  more
          volatile.
                During  2002, ERI introduced the DNX-1u, which is  targeted  at
          Wireless  Service  Providers.  This and prior  product  introductions
          have  strengthened the DNX product line and contributed to the  sales
          growth during 2002.

               Electronic Assemblies.

                Allen  Integrated Assemblies (AIA), a division of  Allen  Organ
          Company,  provides  subcontract manufacture of electronic  assemblies
          for  outside  customers.   The Electronic Assemblies  segment  is  an
          outgrowth  of  the  technical  skills and manufacturing  capabilities
          developed by the Company for its Musical Instruments business.   This
          segment accounted for 7% of 2002 net sales, 14% of 2001 net sales and
          12%  of  net sales in 2000.  AIA derived 73%, 82% and 76% of its  net
          sales from three customers in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
                The  Electronic  Assemblies segment is  very  competitive  with
          numerous manufacturers offering similar services.  AIA customers  are
          generally  obtained  from  a geographic area  located  close  to  the
          Company.
                The  dollar amount of the segment's unshipped order backlog  at
          the  end  of  February  2003  and 2002  was  $721,000  and  $529,000,
          respectively.   All orders are expected to be filled in  the  current
          year.

               Audio Equipment.

                The Audio Equipment segment operates through Legacy Audio,  Inc
          and Allen Audio, Inc.  This segment accounted for 2% of net sales  in
          2002 and 3% of net sales in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
                The principal raw materials used in the segment's products  are
          audio  speakers,  electronic components and wood, all  of  which  are
          readily available from various sources without undue difficulty.
                The  Audio Equipment segment is not dependent on any single  or
          small  group  of customers, the loss of which would have  a  material
          adverse effect on the business
               Legacy Audio, Inc. (LAI) designs, manufactures and markets high-
          quality  audio  speaker cabinets for hi-fi stereo  and  home  theater
          applications.   It also markets electronic audio equipment,  such  as
          amplifiers,  that  are  manufactured to its specifications  by  third
          party suppliers.
                The  principal market for LAI's products is consumers for  home
          use.    The   segment's  products  are  mainly  distributed   through
          independent retail dealers and directly to end-users.  This segment's
          business is not seasonal.
                LAI  historically  sold its products through direct  marketing.
          Management believes that this method of distribution has limited  its
          ability  to  penetrate the broader market.  During 2001  the  Company
          began  implementing a plan to distribute its products through a  more
          traditional dealer network.  The Company has added independent retail
          dealers and will continue to do so in a conservative manner to  build
          a  quality dealer network.  During this period LAI has been  shifting
          marketing  resources to the new method of distribution.  In addition,
          the general economic slowdown has negatively affected sales.
                The high-end audio market is evolving from the traditional two-
          channel  to  the  multi-channel market, which  is  utilized  in  home
          theater   applications.   LAI  has  developed  and  markets  products
          specifically for these home theater applications.
                In  August  2002,  LAI  closed its  manufacturing  facility  in
          Springfield,  Illinois  and  consolidated  all  production  into  the
          Company's manufacturing facility in Macungie, PA.
                LAI  competes with several other high-end audio speaker cabinet
          manufacturers  including  Martin-Logan, Thiel,  B&W,  Celestion,  and
          others.
                LAI  is  not  dependent  on  any single,  or  small  group,  of
          customers.   The  dollar  amount  of the  segment's  unshipped  order
          backlog  at  the  end  of  February 2003 and 2002  was  $106,000  and
          $244,000, respectively.  All orders are expected to be filled in  the
          current year.
               Allen Audio, Inc. (AAI) designs, manufactures and markets Public
          Address  System products.  AAI has developed a public address  system
          mixer  utilizing Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technology also  used
          in  the  Allen  digital organs.  AAI has also  developed  a  line  of
          speaker  cabinets for the public address field.  These  products  are
          being   distributed   through  dealers,  primarily   in   the   sound
          reinforcement business.

          General.

                The  Company's working capital is sufficient to meet the normal
          expansion of inventory and receivables.
                The  Company  spent $7,782,571, $8,004,838, and  $7,340,209  in
          2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, on research and development.  The
          Company  maintains  an ongoing commitment to new product  development
          and expects future expenditures for these activities to be comparable
          to the 2002 level.
                The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries employ  approximately  490
          persons.
                The  Company  monitors its compliance with applicable  federal,
          state,  or  local  provisions  with regard  to  the  environment  and
          implements  procedures or modifies its equipment as  necessary.   The
          Company  does  not  expect any significant capital additions  in  the
          coming year to maintain its compliance.

           Financial information about geographic areas.

                The  Company does not own manufacturing or sales facilities  in
          any  foreign  countries.   See Note 14 to the Consolidated  Financial

                The  Company has established a Foreign Sales Corporation within
          the  meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  This wholly-owned
          subsidiary  is  Allen  Organ International, Inc.,  a  Virgin  Islands
          corporation.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
          Results of Operations

     Liquidity and Capital Resources:
        The  Company continues to maintain a strong financial position and high
     level of liquidity, which enables it to generate funds internally to  meet
     operating  needs,  capital expenditures and short-term  obligations.   Key
     indicators of the Company's liquidity are presented below:
                                            December 31,
                                       2002             2001
          Working Capital          $41,551,688      $38,656,758
          Current Ratio               4.8 to 1         6.0 to 1
          Debt to Equity Ratio       0.30 to 1        0.18 to 1

        Cash  flows provided by operating activities increased during 2002,  as
     compared to 2001 and 2000 primarily due to higher operating income in  the
     Data  Communications  segment, reductions  in  inventory  in  the  Musical
     Instruments and Electronic Assemblies segments and income tax refunds.
        Cash  flows provided by operating activities decreased during  2001  as
     compared  to 2000, primarily due to operating losses incurred in the  Data
     Communications segment.
        Cash  flows  used  in investing activities during  2002  were  used  to
     purchase  approximately $1,039,000, $188,000 and $672,000 of property  and
     equipment  in  the  Musical Instruments, Electronic  Assemblies  and  Data
     Communications segments, respectively.
        Cash  flows  provided by investing activities during 2001 includes  the
     sale  of  more  than  $12,000,000 in short term investments  to  fund  the
     repayment  of  ERI's  bank  loans.   Cash  flows  were  used  to  purchase
     approximately  $529,000  and $736,000 of property  and  equipment  in  the
     Musical Instruments and Data Communications segments, respectively.
        Cash  flows  used  in investing activities during  2000  were  used  to
     purchase  approximately  $3,157,000  in  plant  and  equipment,  including
     $2,148,000  for leasehold improvements and new computer, office  and  test
     equipment to support the growth of ERI.
        As  indicated  in Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  ERI
     had  obtained bank financing to provide them with working capital as  well
     as  funds  to repay $7,000,000 of ERI's inter-company loans due  to  Allen
     Organ  Company.   The  proceeds of the term  loan  were  invested  in  the
     Company's short-term investment accounts.  During June 2001 ERI repaid all
     outstanding bank loans totaling $12,000,000 with funds provided  by  Allen
     Organ  Company.  The Company originally obtained these loans to  give  ERI
     financial autonomy as it explored strategic alternatives.  As a result  of
     changes  in  the  financial  markets, the Company  decided  to  repay  the
     outstanding loans to eliminate the costs related to this financing.

     Results of Operations:

     Sales and Operating Income
        Consolidated  sales for 2002 increased $7,252,035 (12%)  when  compared
     to 2001, primarily due to higher sales in the Data Communications segment.
     Consolidated sales for 2001 decreased $12,025,695 (17%) when  compared  to
     2000, primarily due to lower sales in the Data Communications segment,  as
     well as in the Musical Instruments segment.

     Musical Instruments Segment

        The  domestic  sales for 2002 increased $1,077,932.   While  the  order
     rate for 2002 was slightly lower than 2001, the 2002 sales were higher due
     to  shipments made to customers against a higher order backlog.  The  2001
     decrease  in  domestic  sales was the result of  shipments  in  2000  made
     against  a  higher order backlog.  As discussed on page  3,  the  economic
     downturn may affect future order volume.
        Export sales were lower in 2002, as compared to the previous year,  and
     approximately equal in 2001 and 2000.  Certain foreign markets continue to
     be affected by unfavorable economic conditions.  While the value of the US
     dollar  compared to certain foreign currencies has decreased, there  is  a
     time lag before any such change can have an impact on export sales.
        In  recent  years  the Company has entered a different  subset  of  the
     organ  market  that  includes the sale of its organ consoles  and  control
     electronics to customers that want to retain their wind-blown  pipes.   In
     the  past,  this market was served by pipe organ manufacturers  and  local
     pipe  organ  maintenance organizations.  The Company's ability to  produce
     both  the wood cabinetry and digital electronics gives it an advantage  in
     this market.
        Gross  profit  margins on sales were 29.5%, 30.1%  and  36.5%  for  the
     years  ended  December  31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.   The  2002
     decrease  was  due  to higher operating costs, primarily employee  pension
     expense  and lower absorption of fixed costs related to planned  decreases
     in   the  level  of  inventory  necessitating  slightly  lower  levels  of
     production.  The decrease in gross profit in 2001, when compared to  2000,
     was  a  result of lower sales volume over which to absorb fixed costs  and
     changes in product mix.
        Selling and advertising expenses remained relatively constant in  2002,
     2001   and   2000.    General   and  administrative   expenses   increased
     approximately   $38,000  in  2002  when  compared  to  2001,   which   was
     approximately equal to 2000.
        Research  and development expenses decreased approximately  $29,000  in
     2002 from 2001 and decreased approximately $25,000 in 2001 from 2000.
        Several  of  the  Company's  operating expenses  continue  to  rise  at
     significant  rates  including business insurances,  medial  insurance  and
     pension expense.  The Company's pension expense has increased due to lower
     investment  returns  realized  in the Company's  defined  benefit  pension
     plans.  The Company has reduced its long-term rate of return assumption in
     both  of  its defined benefit pension plans due to lower projected  future
     investment returns and expects that pension related costs will increase in
     future years.

     Data Communications Segment

        Domestic  sales increased $3,539,977 in 2002, compared to the  previous
     year,   and   decreased  $2,989,447  in  2001  when  compared   to   2000.
     International sales increased $7,086,312 in 2002, compared to the previous
     year,  and  decreased $4,422,010 during 2001 when compared to  2000.   The
     increase  in international sales in 2002 was primarily from sales  to  one
     customer.   The 2002 sales increased due to new product introductions  and
     from  redirecting  the  Company's sales and marketing  efforts  away  from
     CLEC's to other Data Communications markets, for which its product line is
     well  suited, including the wireless, enterprise, government  and  certain
     international  markets.   The 2001 sales decreased  from  2000  due  to  a
     general slowdown in the world economy and a more significant industry-wide
     slowdown  in Data Communications markets.  Some of this segment's products
     had  been sold to CLEC's, many of which had difficulty raising capital and
     became insolvent.
        Gross  profit  margins were 50%, 40% and 47% in 2002,  2001  and  2000,
     respectively.   The 2002 increase is attributable to higher  sales  volume
     over  which  to absorb fixed costs and changes in product  mix.   Cost  of
     goods  sold for 2001 includes $1,539,000 of additional non-cash  inventory
     valuation  adjustments recorded at VIR, Inc. for slow moving and  obsolete
     inventory associated with discontinued product lines.  The result of these
     adjustments was to decrease the 2001 gross profit margin by 6% from 46% to
     40%.   The  decrease in the 2001 gross profit margin from 2000,  excluding
     the  inventory valuation adjustments, was due to lower sales  volume  over
     which  to  absorb fixed costs and competitive pressures to  lower  selling
     prices  of products.  While the Company strives to maintain profit margins
     by developing products that offer desirable features, the industry is very
     competitive which often results in pricing changes to obtain and  maintain
     market share.
        Selling  expenses decreased approximately $654,000 in 2002 compared  to
     2001,  and  decreased approximately $1,123,000 in 2001 from  2000.   These
     decreases are related to cost cutting measures initiated in the first half
     of  2001  due  to  the  economic downturn.   In  addition,  2001  expenses
     decreased due to lower sales in 2001.
        Administrative  expenses  decreased  approximately  $21,000   in   2002
     compared to 2001, and decreased approximately $347,000 in 2001 compared to
     2000,  from cost cutting measures initiated in the first half of 2001  due
     to the economic downturn.
        Research  and  development  expenses were  $6,352,909,  $6,599,104  and
     $5,911,740  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2002,  2001  and  2000,
     respectively.    The 2002 decrease is primarily due to the combination  of
     the  VIR  operations into ERI during the second half of 2001.  The segment
     is  committed to new product development and expects these expenditures to
     continue at approximately the same level in 2003.
        The  combination  of increased sales, higher gross  margins  and  lower
     operating costs resulted in operating income of $2,105,802 during 2002 for
     this  segment  compared to an operating loss of $8,284,232 in  2001.   The
     2001  operating  loss  was  negatively  affected  by  inventory  valuation
     adjustments, plant closing costs, and a charge to write down the  goodwill
     and intangible assets of VIR totaling $3,469,000.  Future sales visibility
     remains limited throughout the Data Communications market that ERI  serves
     with  many companies that buy equipment continuing to lower their  capital
     expenditures  for  such equipment.  These factors,  along  with  continued
     uncertainty  in  completing sales to larger accounts,  create  significant
     uncertainty of operating results in future quarters.

     Electronic Assemblies Segment

        Sales  decreased $3,631,878 and $242,178 in 2002 and 2001, respectively
     compared  to  the  previous  year.   The segment's  order  rate  decreased
     significantly  beginning in the second half of 2001 as  a  result  of  the
     economic   slowdown   that  has  also  affected  the  Company's   contract
     manufacturing  customers.  The order rate is expected  to  continue  at  a
     lower  level in future quarters.  Because of this decrease in  sales,  the
     Company  continues to take steps to reduce its costs at its  Macungie,  PA
     plant.
        Gross  profit  margin  for  2002 was a loss of approximately  $(61,000)
     (1%).   Gross  profit  margins were 7.1% and  19.5%  for  2001  and  2000,
     respectively.  These decreases are the result of lower sales over which to
     absorb fixed costs.
        Selling,  general  and administrative expenses decreased  approximately
     $52,000  in 2002 compared to 2001, and increased approximately $95,000  in
     2001 compared to 2000.  The segment continues its efforts to diversify its
     customer base and to improve its production capabilities to offer state of
     the art manufacturing services to its customers.

     Audio Equipment Segment

        Sales  decreased $312,659 and $689,870 in 2002 and 2001,  respectively,
     compared  to  the previous year.  Legacy Audio has historically  sold  its
     products  through  a direct marketing program.  Management  believes  that
     this  method  of  distribution has limited its ability  to  penetrate  the
     broader market.  In 2002, Legacy began distributing its products through a
     more traditional dealer network.  The Company has added independent retail
     dealers  and will continue to do so in a conservative manner  to  build  a
     quality  dealer  network.  During this period, Legacy  has  been  shifting
     marketing  resources to the new method of distribution.  In addition,  the
     general  economic  slowdown has slowed the sales of some  consumer  goods.
     This  has resulted in a decrease in direct sales that has not been  offset
     by dealer sales.
        Gross  profit  margins  were  22%, 12% and  43%  for  the  years  ended
     December  31,  2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The 2002 increase  over
     the  previous year was due to steps taken to reduce this segment's  costs,
     including  the  consolidation of all manufacturing into the  Macungie,  PA
     plant.  The 2001 decrease compared to 2000 is attributable to lower  sales
     volume over which to absorb fixed costs.
        Selling,  general  and  administrative  costs  decreased  approximately
     $233,000  and  $250,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively,  compared  to  the
     previous  year, as a result of steps taken to reduce operating  costs  and
     because of Legacy Audio's switch to a dealer based selling model.
        The  Company  has  developed a line of Public Address  System  products
     which  it  markets  under the name Allen Audio.  These products  are  sold
     through a dealer network, some of which are also organ dealers.

     Other Income (Expense)

        Investment  income increased slightly for the year ended  December  31,
     2002 when compared to 2001 due to realized gains on investments and higher
     invested  balances  that offset lower rates of return on  invested  funds.
     Investment  income  for the year ended December 31,  2001  decreased  when
     compared  to  2000 due to lower invested balances.  Interest  expense  was
     incurred in 2001 and 2000 on short-term bank financing related to ERI.
        The  2001  loss  on  the sale of property, plant &  equipment  includes
     approximately  $158,000 of losses related to the disposition  of  property
     and  equipment  at  VIR's  Southampton, PA facility  that  was  closed  in
     September 2001.

     Income Taxes

        The  effective tax rate (benefit) was 29.3%, (36.8%) and 22.4% in 2002,
     2001  and 2000, respectively.  The decrease in the 2002 effective tax rate
     is due to tax credits and other non-taxable items.  The 2001 effective tax
     rate  increased  due to tax credits and other preference items  increasing
     the benefit to the Company related to the 2001 loss.

     Significant Accounting Policies

        The  significant  accounting policies of the Company are  described  in
     Note  1  of  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.  The  preparation  of
     financial  statements  in conformity with accounting principles  generally
     accepted  in  the  United  State of America requires  management  to  make
     estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  and
     liabilities  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities  at  the
     date  of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue  and
     expense during the reporting period.
        Certain   accounting   estimates  and  assumptions   are   particularly
     sensitive  because  of  their significance to the  consolidated  financial
     statements  and  the  possibility that future events  affecting  them  may
     differ  markedly.  The accounting policies of the Company , which  require
     significant estimates and assumptions, are described below.

          Carrying  Value of Obsolete and Slow Moving Inventory:   The  Company
          has  written down the value of inventory that may become obsolete  or
          that  will  not  be  used in the normal course  of  business  to  its
          estimated net realizable value.

          Allowance  for  Doubtful  Accounts:   The  Company  has  recorded  an
          allowance  for  the  estimated amount of accounts  which  may  become
          uncollectible.

          Carrying  Value  of  Goodwill  and Intangible  Assets:   The  Company
          reviews  the  recoverability of its goodwill and  intangible  assets.
          Any impairment in value is charged against current operations.

          Realization  of Deferred Income Tax Benefits:  As discussed  in  Note
          17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has recorded
          valuation allowances related to the uncertainty of realizing  certain
          state and federal net operating loss carryforwards.

        Risk  factors that may affect these judgements include the  volume  and
     timing  of  orders  received, changes in global  economics  and  financial
     markets,  changes  in the mix of products sold, market acceptance  of  the
     Company's  and  its  customer's products, competitive  pricing  pressures,
     global currency valuations, the availability of electronic components that
     the  Company  purchases  from suppliers, the  Company's  ability  to  meet
     increasing  demand, the Company's ability to introduce new products  on  a
     timely basis, the timing of new product announcements and introductions by
     the Company or its competitors, changing customer requirements, delays  in
     new  product  qualifications,  the  timing  and  extent  of  research  and
     development expenses and fluctuations in manufacturing yields.

     Factors that May Affect Operating Results

        The  statements  contained in this report on Form  10-K  that  are  not
     purely  historical are forward looking statements within  the  meaning  of
     Section  27A  of  the  Securities Act of  1933  and  Section  21E  of  the
     Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934, including  statements  regarding  the
     Company's  expectations,  hopes, intentions or  strategies  regarding  the
     future.   Forward looking statements include: statements regarding  future
     products or product development; statements regarding future research  and
     development  spending and the Company's marketing and product  development
     strategy and statements regarding future production capacity.  All forward
     looking  statements  included in this document are  based  on  information
     available  to the Company on the date hereof, and the Company  assumes  no
     obligation  to  update any such forward looking statements.   Readers  are
     cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements,
     which  reflect management's opinions only as of the date hereof.   Readers
     should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents  the
     Company  files  from  time  to  time  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange
     Commission,  including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be  filed  by
     the  Company  in  fiscal  year 2003.  It is important  to  note  that  the
     Company's  actual  results  could differ materially  from  those  in  such
     forward  looking statements.  Some of the factors that could cause  actual
     results to differ materially are set forth below.
        The  Company  has  experienced and expects to  continue  to  experience
     fluctuations  in  its  results of operations.   Factors  that  affect  the
     Company's  results of operations include the volume and timing  of  orders
     received,  changes in global economics and financial markets,  changes  in
     the  mix  of  products sold, market acceptance of the  Company's  and  its
     customer's  products,  competitive  pricing  pressures,  global   currency
     valuations,  the  availability of electronic components that  the  Company
     purchases from suppliers, the Company's ability to meet increasing demand,
     the  Company's  ability to introduce new products on a timely  basis,  the
     timing  of  new product announcements and introductions by the Company  or
     its  competitors, changing customer requirements, delays  in  new  product
     qualifications, the timing and extent of research and development expenses
     and fluctuations in manufacturing yields.  As a result of the foregoing or
     other  factors,  there  can  be no assurance that  the  Company  will  not
     experience  material  fluctuations  in  future  operating  results  on   a
     quarterly or annual basis, which would materially and adversely affect the
     Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

     New Accounting Standards

        In  December  2002, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board  ("FASB")
     issued  SFAS  No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition
     and  Disclosure-an amendment of SFAS No. 123." This statement amends  SFAS
     No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative
     methods  of  transition for a voluntary change to  the  fair  value  based
     method  of  accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
     this  Statement  amends the disclosure requirements of  Statement  123  to
     require  prominent  disclosures  in  both  annual  and  interim  financial
     statements  about  the  method  of  accounting  for  stock-based  employee
     compensation  and the effect of the method used on reported  results.  The
     Company continues to account for stock-based compensation using Accounting
     Principles  Board  Statement  No.  25, "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to
     Employees,"  and has not adopted the recognition provisions  of  SFAS  No.
     123,  as  amended  by SFAS No. 148. However, the Company has  adopted  the
     disclosure  provisions for the current fiscal year and has  included  this
     information in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
        Effective  January  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted  SFAS   No.   142.
     Accordingly,   no   amortization  of  goodwill  was  recognized   in   the
     accompanying consolidated financial statements of operations for the  year
     ended  December 31, 2002, compared to $52,666 and $129,627 for  the  years
     ended  December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  In accordance  with  the
     provisions  of  SFAS  No.  142,  management  has  performed  the  required
     transitional  impairment  test of goodwill  and  has  determined  that  no
     impairment  loss need be recognized in the year ended December  31,  2002.
     As  required  by  SFAS No. 142, prior results have not been  restated.   A
     reconciliation  of the previously reported net income (loss)  and  earning
     (loss) per common share for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, as
     if SFAS No. 142 had been adopted as of January 1, 2000, is as follows:
                                                     December 31,
                                                  2001          2000
           Reported net (loss) income         $(4,083,810)   $3,954,896
           Add back: Goodwill amortization,
            net of related tax effect              32,165        79,612
           Adjusted net (loss) income         $(4,051,645)   $4,034,508

           Basic and diluted (loss) earnings
            per share, as reported            $     (3.49)   $     3.38
           Impact of goodwill amortization,
            net of tax                               0.03          0.07
           Adjusted basic and diluted (loss)
            earnings per share                $     (3.46)   $     3.45

        During   2002  the  FASB  issued.  SFAS  146,  "Accounting  for   Costs
     Associated  with  Exit or Disposal Activities", which addresses  financial
     accounting  and  reporting  for costs associated  with  exit  or  disposal
     activities.  The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.  146  to
     have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

        Financial  instruments that potentially subject the Company  to  market
     and/or credit risk consist principally of short-term investments and trade
     receivables.   The Company places substantially all of its investments  in
     mutual funds holding federal, state and local government obligations  and,
     by  policy,  limits the amount of credit exposure in any  one  investment.
     The  Company's  Musical Instruments segment sells  most  of  its  products
     through  established  dealer  networks.  The Data  Communications  segment
     sells  most  of  their products directly to end-users,  to  wholesale  and
     retail  distributors worldwide and under OEM agreements  with  other  data
     communications  companies.   The market and credit  risk  associated  with
     related  receivables  is limited due to the large number  of  dealers  and
     distributors  and their geographic dispersion.  The Company has  no  other
     material exposure to market risk.

Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplemental Data

        The  information required by this Item is set forth on pages 15 through
     34 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
        Financial Disclosure

        There were no reportable events as described in Item 304(b).

The Board of Directors
 and Stockholders
Allen Organ Company


      We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated balance  sheets  of
Allen  Organ Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002  and  2001,
and  the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'  equity
and  cash flows and the related financial statement schedule for each  of
the  years  in  the  three year period ended December  31,  2002.   These
consolidated  financial statements and financial statement  schedule  are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  and
financial statement schedules based on our audits.

      We  conducted  our  audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards
generally  accepted  in  the United States of America.   Those  standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An  audit  includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting  the
amounts  and  disclosures  in the financial statements.   An  audit  also
includes   assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement  presentation. We believe that our audits provide a  reasonable
basis for our opinion.

      In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred  to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Allen  Organ Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002  and  2001,
and  the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three year period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also,  in  our  opinion, the related financial statement  schedule,  when
considered  in  relation to the basic consolidated  financial  statements
taken  as  a  whole,  presents  fairly, in  all  material  respects,  the
information set forth therein.

     As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets".

                     ALLEN ORGAN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 Background and Significant Accounting Policies
     Background:
        Allen  Organ  Company  and  Subsidiaries  (Company)  operate  in   four
     industry  segments:  Musical Instruments, Data Communications,  Electronic
     Assemblies,  and Audio Equipment.  See Note 21 for additional  information
     on the operating activities of each segment.

     Principles of Consolidation:
        The  consolidated  financial statements include  the  accounts  of  the
     Company  and  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries  (Allen  Audio,  Inc.,  Allen
     Diversified,  Inc.,  Legacy  Audio, Inc.)  and  majority-owned  subsidiary
     (Eastern  Research, Inc.).  In addition, the Company has  other  inactive,
     wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  All material intercompany  transactions  have
     been eliminated.

     Use of Estimates:
        The  preparation of financial statements in conformity  with  generally
     accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to
     make  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
     and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
     date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues  and
     expenses  during  the reported period.  Actual results could  differ  from
     those estimates.

     Investments:
        The  Company accounts for its short-term investments in accordance with
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for
     Certain  Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.  Management determines
     the  appropriate  classification of its investments  in  debt  and  equity
     securities  at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination  at
     each balance sheet date.

     Accounts Receivable Reserve:
         The   Company   records   an  allowance  for  uncollectible   accounts
     receivable based on historical loss experience, customer payment  patterns
     and  current  economic trends.  Management reviews  the  adequacy  of  the
     allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable on a quarterly basis  and,
     if necessary, increases or decreases the reserve.

     Inventories:
        Inventories  are  valued  at the lower of  cost  or  market.   Cost  is
     determined  using the first-in, first- out (FIFO) method for substantially
     all inventories.

     Property, Plant and Equipment:
        Property,  plant  and  equipment are stated at cost.   Depreciation  is
     computed  over  the estimated useful asset lives using both  straight-line
     and  accelerated  methods for financial reporting and accelerated  methods
     for tax reporting purposes.

     Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
        Goodwill  represents the excess of costs over fair value of  assets  of
     businesses acquired. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS  No.  142,
     Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as of January 1, 2002. Goodwill  and
     intangible  assets  acquired  in  a  purchase  business  combination   and
     determined  to  have  an  indefinite useful life are  not  amortized,  but
     instead  tested  for impairment at least annually in accordance  with  the
     provisions  of  SFAS No. 142.  SFAS No. 142 also requires that  intangible
     assets  with  estimable  useful lives be amortized over  their  respective
     estimated  useful lives to their estimated residual values,  and  reviewed
     for  impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment
     or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
        Prior  to  January  1, 2002, goodwill was amortized  to  expense  on  a
     straight-line basis over various periods of 5-20 years. The carrying value
     of  goodwill  was  reviewed  for possible impairment  whenever  events  or
     changes in circumstances indicated that an impairment might exist.
        Intangible  assets  represent  identifiable  assets  such  as  customer
     lists, developed technology and trademarks acquired in connection with the
     purchase  of the Company's subsidiaries.  Intangible assets are  amortized
     on  a straight-line basis over various periods generally from 5 - 20 years
     and  are  presented  net  of accumulated amortization  of  $3,024,517  and
     $2,381,307 at December 31, 2002 and 2001 respectively.
        The  carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets for each business
     is   continually  reviewed  to  assess  its  recoverability  from   future
     operations,  based  on  future cash flows (undiscounted)  expected  to  be
     generated  by such operations.  Any impairment in value indicated  by  the
     assessment  would be computed based on discounted cash flows  and  charged
     against current operations.

     Revenue Recognition:
        The  Company  recognizes  revenue when products  are  shipped  and  the
     customer  takes  ownership and assumes risk of  loss,  collection  of  the
     relevant  receivable is probable, persuasive evidence  of  an  arrangement
     exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable.

     Research and Development and Advertising:
        Research  and development and advertising expenditures are  charged  to
     expense  as  incurred.  Research and development expenses  are  separately
     disclosed  in the consolidated statements of operations while  advertising
     costs  were  $333,695,  $440,757, and $505,170 in  2002,  2001  and  2000,
     respectively.

     Income Taxes:
        Income  taxes  are accounted for under the asset and liability  method.
     Deferred  tax  assets and liabilities are recognized for  the  future  tax
     consequences  attributable to differences between the financial  statement
     carrying  amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their  respective
     tax  bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred  tax
     assets  and  liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected  to
     apply  to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
     are  expected  to  be recovered or settled.  The effect  on  deferred  tax
     assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
     the period that includes the enactment date.

     Financial Instruments:
        Financial  instruments that potentially subject the Company  to  credit
     risk  consist principally of short-term investments and trade receivables.
     The  Company  places substantially all of its investments in mutual  funds
     holding  federal, state and local government obligations and,  by  policy,
     limits the amount of credit exposure in any one investment.  The Company's
     Musical Instruments segment sells most of its products through established
     dealer  networks.   The  Data Communications segment  sells  most  of  its
     products  direct to customers, to distributors worldwide and to  a  lesser
     extent under OEM agreements with other data communications companies.  The
     credit  risk  associated with related receivables is limited  due  to  the
     large number of dealers and distributors and their geographic dispersion.

     Reclassifications:
        Certain  amounts  in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements  have  been
     reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.

     New Accounting Standards:
        In  December  2002, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board  ("FASB")
     issued  SFAS  No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition
     and  Disclosure-an amendment of SFAS No. 123." This statement amends  SFAS
     No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative
     methods  of  transition for a voluntary change to  the  fair  value  based
     method  of  accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
     this  Statement  amends the disclosure requirements of  Statement  123  to
     require  prominent  disclosures  in  both  annual  and  interim  financial
     statements  about  the  method  of  accounting  for  stock-based  employee
     compensation  and the effect of the method used on reported  results.  The
     Company continues to account for stock-based compensation using Accounting
     Principles  Board  Statement  No.  25, "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to
     Employees,"  and has not adopted the recognition provisions  of  SFAS  No.
     123,  as  amended  by SFAS No. 148. However, the Company has  adopted  the
     disclosure  provisions for the current fiscal year and has  included  this
     information in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
        Effective  January  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted  SFAS   No.   142.
     Accordingly,   no   amortization  of  goodwill  was  recognized   in   the
     accompanying consolidated financial statements of operations for the  year
     ended  December 31, 2002, compared to $52,666 and $129,627 for  the  years
     ended  December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  In accordance  with  the
     provisions  of  SFAS  No.  142,  management  has  performed  the  required
     transitional  impairment  test of goodwill  and  has  determined  that  no
     impairment  loss need be recognized in the year ended December  31,  2002.
     As  required  by  SFAS No. 142, prior results have not been  restated.   A
     reconciliation  of the previously reported net income (loss)  and  earning
     (loss) per common share for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, as
     if SFAS No. 142 had been adopted as of January 1, 2000, is as follows:
                                                     December 31,
                                                  2001         2000

       earnings per share                     $     (3.46)  $     3.45

        During  2002 the FASB issued SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
     with  Exit  or Disposal Activities", which addresses financial  accounting
     and  reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities.  The
     Company  does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have  a  material
     effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

     Stock-Based Compensation:
        The  Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using  the
     accounting  prescribed  by Accounting Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  25,
     Accounting  for  Stock  Issued to Employees.  Since  the  Company  is  not
     required  to adopt the fair value based recognition provisions  prescribed
     under  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, as amended  by
     SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, it has elected only
     to  comply  with  the disclosure requirements set forth in the  Statements
     (see Note 19).
        Had  compensation  cost  been determined on the  basis  of  fair  value
     pursuant  to  SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, net income  (loss)
     and earnings per share would have been decreased as follows:

                                            2002          2001         2000
       Net income (loss)

        Deduct: Total stock-based
        employee compensation expense
        determined under fair value based
        method for all awards, net
        of related tax effects              (69,374)      (39,447)    (134,238)
       Pro forma                         $2,615,983   $(4,123,257)  $3,820,658

       Earnings (loss) per share
           As reported                        $2.29        $(3.49)       $3.38
           Pro forma                          $2.23        $(3.52)       $3.26

        The  fair  value of each option granted is estimated on the grant  date
     using  the  Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The following assumptions
     were  made in estimating the fair value of options granted under the Allen
     Organ Company stock option plan:

          Assumptions
           Dividend yield                 1.40%
           Risk-free interest rate        2.50%
           Expected life                7 years
           Expected volatility              10%

NOTE 5 Note Receivable
           The  Company  has  entered  into  two  split-dollar  life  insurance
       agreements  with  its President, who is the insured  and  owner  of  the
       policies.   The  policy  owner is required to pay  the  portion  of  the
       premiums  equal  to  the  value of the economic  benefit  determined  in
       accordance  with applicable IRS Revenue Rulings.  The Company  pays  the
       balance of the net premiums, which approximates $450,000 annually.
           The  agreements  provide  that  the Company  shall  be  entitled  to
       recover the amount of premiums paid out of the built up cash value  upon
       termination  of the agreement or out of the proceeds upon the  death  of
       the  insured.   As security for repayment, the Company is  a  collateral
       assignee  of the policy to the extent of any such unreimbursed premiums.
       The   Company  is  also  secured  by  the  personal  obligation  of  its
       President.   The  note receivable exceeds the cash  surrender  value  of
       these  policies by approximately $445,000 and $450,000 at  December  31,
       2002  and 2001, respectively.  However, the Company's President  has  an
       adequate level of personal net assets to cover these amounts.

NOTE 6 Intangible Assets
           Intangible assets subject to amortization are as follows:
                                        As of December 31, 2002
                             Gross Carrying  Accumulated   Weighted Average

        Total                  $4,653,481   $3,024,517

           Amortization  expense was $643,210, $671,689 and $621,781  in  2002,
       2001  and  2000, respectively.  Estimated amortization expense  for  the
       next five years is as follows:

              2003                   $ 636,251
              2004                     405,935
              2005                     121,465
              2006                      63,214
              2007                      27,789

           Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company was required to evaluate
     its  existing  intangible  assets  and goodwill  that  were  recorded  in
     purchase    business   combinations,   and   to   make   any    necessary
     reclassifications  in  order  to  conform  with  the  new  classification
     criteria  in  SFAS No. 141 for recognition separate from  goodwill.   The
     Company  was  also  required to reassess the useful  lives  and  residual
     values  of  all  intangible  assets  acquired,  and  make  any  necessary
     amortization  period adjustments by the end of the first  interim  period
     after  adoption.  For intangible assets identified as  having  indefinite
     useful lives, the Company was required to test those intangible asset for
     impairment  in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142 within  the
     first  interim period. Impairment was measured as the excess of  carrying
     value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life.
     The results of this analysis did not require the Company to recognize  an
     impairment loss.

NOTE 7 Plant Closure Costs and Impairment Charges
        During  2001  the  Company recorded a charge to operating  expenses  of
     $1,400,000  related  to  the  impairment in  the  value  of  goodwill  and
     intangibles which arose in connection with the previous acquisition  of  a
     company.   This write down was attributable to the downturn  in  the  data
     communications industry in which the company operated, the combination  of
     this  company  into  another  subsidiary  and  closure  of  the  company's
     facility, all of which reduced expectations of future cash flows.
        In  connection with the consolidation of the operations  of  these  two
     subsidiaries and the closure of one plant, the Company recorded  a  charge
     of  $530,000  (including  employee severance  and  benefits  for  nineteen
     employees and other exit costs).  All of these costs were paid by December
     31, 2002.

NOTE 8 Notes Payable - Bank
           In  June 2000 Eastern Research, Inc. (ERI) obtained a term loan and
     revolving  line of credit from a bank.  During June 2001 ERI  repaid  all
     outstanding bank loans totaling $12,000,000 with funds provided by  Allen
     Organ Company.

NOTE 15    Retirement Plans
           The  Company  sponsors two noncontributory defined benefit  pension
     plans  which  cover  substantially all of its employees.   Salaried  plan
     benefits  are  generally based on the employee's  years  of  service  and
     compensation  levels.  Hourly plan benefits are based on various  monthly
     amounts for each year of credited service.  The Company's funding  policy
     is  to  contribute  amounts to the plans sufficient to meet  the  minimum
     funding requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security
     Act of 1974, plus such additional amounts as the Company may determine to
     be  appropriate from time to time.  Plan assets are comprised principally
     of  cash  equivalents  at  December 31, 2002 and cash  equivalents,  U.S.
     Government obligations, fixed income securities, and equity securities at
     December 31, 2001 and 2000.

           The  Company  provides  a 401(k) deferred compensation  and  profit
     sharing  plan  for the benefit of eligible employees.   The  plan  allows
     eligible  employees  to  defer a portion of  their  annual  compensation,
     pursuant  to  Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Profit-sharing
     contributions  to  the  plan  are  discretionary  as  determined  by  the

     follows:
                                                      2002           2001

           At  December  31,  2002,  the Company has  available  approximately
     $2,315,000  of  unused  federal  and  $17,949,000  of  unused  state  net
     operating loss carry forwards that may be applied against future  taxable
     income  and that expire in various years from 2004 to 2022.  The  Company
     has  a  valuation  allowance of $1,170,000 for the  deferred  tax  assets
     related  to  the uncertainty of realizing state net operating loss  carry
     forwards and federal net operating losses of a subsidiary not included in
     the consolidated federal income tax return.

NOTE 18    Earnings Per Share
           Earnings  per  share were computed using 1,170,191 shares  in  2002,
       1,170,480  shares  in 2001, and 1,170,618 shares in 2000,  the  weighted
       average  number  of  shares outstanding during each  year.   Outstanding
       stock  options were not included in computing earnings per share because
       their effect was antidilutive.

NOTE 19    Stock Option Plans
           In  July  2002,  the  Company established  an  employee  stock-based
       compensation plan to assist in attracting and retaining personnel.   The
       maximum number of the Company's Class B shares that may be issued  under
       the  plan approximates a 9% interest in the Company.  Options are issued
       at  the fair market value on the date of grant.  The maximum term of the
       options is 10 years, and generally vest equally over 4 years.
           As  of  December 31, 2002, total options issued represent 1% of  the
       shares  currently  outstanding.  Vested options represent  0.2%  of  the
       currently outstanding shares.
           Following  is  a summary of the activity under the plan  during  the
       year ended December 31, 2002:

           Eastern  Research, Inc. (ERI) also provides an employee  stock-based
       compensation plan to assist in attracting and retaining personnel.   The
       maximum  number of subsidiary shares that may be issued under  the  plan
       approximates  a 15% interest in the subsidiary.  Options  are  generally
       issued  at  the estimated fair market value.  The maximum  term  of  the
       options is 6 years, and generally vest equally over 4 years.
           As  of December 31, 2002, total options issued represents 13% of the
       ERI  shares currently outstanding.  Vested options consist of 10% of the
       currently outstanding shares of ERI.
           ERI  recognized  compensation expense of $59,375 in  both  2002  and
       2001  and  $29,687 in 2000 related to options granted with  an  exercise
       price less than the fair market value on the date of grant.
           See  Note  1  for  the pro forma effects on net  income  (loss)  and
       earnings  per share had compensation cost been determined on  the  basis
       of fair value pursuant to SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148.

NOTE 20    Related Party Transactions

       $63,546 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 21     Industry Segment Information
           The   Company's   operations  are  classified  into  four   industry
       segments:   Musical   Instruments,   Data   Communications,   Electronic
       Assemblies,  and  Audio Equipment.  The Musical Instruments  segment  is
       comprised   of   operations   principally  involved   in   the   design,
       manufacture,  sale  and  distribution  of  electronic  keyboard  musical
       instruments, primarily digital organs and related accessories.   Musical
       instruments are sold primarily to retail dealers worldwide.
           The  Data Communications segment is involved in the design, sale and
       distribution  of  data  communications equipment.   Data  communications
       products  are  sold direct to customers and distributors  worldwide  and
       under OEM agreements with several customers.
           The  Electronic  Assemblies segment is involved in the  manufacture,
       sale  and  distribution of electronic assemblies for  outside  customers
       used   primarily  as  control  devices  and  other  circuitry  in  their
       products.   Subcontract  assembly services  are  provided  primarily  to
       industrial concerns in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
           The  Audio Equipment segment is involved in the design, manufacture,
       sale  and  distribution  of high quality speaker  cabinets  and  related
       equipment  for  hi-fi  stereo and home theater  applications.   Legacy's
       products  are  sold  worldwide  primarily  through  independent   retail
       dealers  and  to a lesser extent directly to individual customers.   The
       Company, through its subsidiary Allen Audio, Inc., designs, markets  and
       sells  through  distributors a line of Public Address  system  products,
       which  have  been  targeted at small to mid-sized churches,  auditoriums
       and similar customers.
           Intersegment  sales are generally priced at cost plus  a  percentage
       mark-up,  and are generally marginally less than prices which  would  be
       charged  for  the same product to unaffiliated customers.   Intersegment
       sales   are  excluded  from  net  sales  reported  in  the  accompanying
       consolidated statements of income.  Identifiable assets by  segment  are
       those  assets  that  are  used in the Company's operations  within  that
       segment.   General  corporate assets consist  principally  of  cash  and
       short-term investments.
           The  Electronic Assemblies segment derived 73%, 82% and 76%  of  its
       revenues  from  three  customers in 2002, 2001 and  2000,  respectively.
       The Data  Communications segment derived 40% of its  net sales from  two
       customers in 2002 and 13% and 16% of its net sales from one customer  in
       2001  and  2000,  respectively.  The Company's  Musical  Instrument  and
       Audio Equipment segments are not dependent on any single customer.
           In  October  2002,  Legacy Audio, Inc. sold its manufacturing  plant
       located  in Springfield, Illinois for $285,000 (net of selling expenses)
       and  recognized  a  gain  on the sale of approximately  $7,000.   Legacy
       ceased  operations  at  this  facility effective  August  31,  2002  and
       consolidated  all  of  its  production into the Company's  manufacturing
       facility in Macungie, PA.
