Item 1.	Description of Business
            ------------------------
General
-------
Ajay Sports, Inc. (the "Company") owns Pro Golf of America, Inc., the world's
largest franchiser of  "golf only" retail stores, with over 150 stores in the
United States, Canada, the Bahamas, and the Philippines.  The Company also
marketed and distributed golf clubs, golf bags, golf gloves, golf
accessories, hand-pulled golf carts and casual living furniture, prior to
deciding to discontinue those business operations in June 2000.

The Company operates the franchise segment of its business through Pro Golf
International, Inc. ("PGI"), a majority-owned subsidiary, which was formed
during 1999 and owns 100% of the outstanding stock of Pro Golf of America,
Inc. ("PGOA" or "Pro Golf") and a majority of the stock of ProGolf.com, Inc.
("PG.com"). PGOA is the franchiser of Pro Golf Discount retail golf stores
("PGD stores").  ProGolf.com is a development stage company formed to help
drive traffic to its franchisee stores and to sell golf equipment and other
golf-related products and services over the Internet.  The Company operated
the mass-market golf segment of its business through Ajay Leisure Products,
Inc. ("Ajay") a wholly owned subsidiary. Leisure Life, Inc. ("Leisure Life"),
another wholly owned operating subsidiary, manufactures and markets casual
living furniture and is still  operating while a sale of Leisure Life is
being pursued or until it is liquidated or closed.  Palm Springs Golf, Inc.
("Palm Springs"), another wholly owned operating subsidiary, marketed golf
clubs, golf bags, golf gloves, accessories and carts for distribution to the
off-course pro shop markets.  Prestige Golf Corp. ("Prestige"), another
wholly owned subsidiary, purchased current in-line and closeout golf
equipment for distribution mainly through Pro Golf Discount stores and an
Internet site, ProGolf.com.  In June 2000, the Company's management elected
to discontinue the businesses of Ajay, Leisure Life, Palm Springs, and
Prestige due to on going operating losses and negative cash flows at these
companies. All references to the Company include PGI, PGOA, and PG.com, Ajay,
Leisure Life, Palm Springs, and Prestige unless otherwise specified.

PGOA provides services to its franchisees in exchange for initial franchise
fees and ongoing royalties based on a percentage of retail sales.  The
Company plans to enhance its traditional sales and distribution methods by
its recently introduced Internet site, ProGolf.com, and is also exploring new
franchise models, such as golf domes.  Ajay's products primarily were sold
nationwide to large retailers such as discount stores, department stores,
catalog showrooms and other mass merchandise and sports specialty outlets.
The products manufactured by Ajay were primarily sold under the Spalding,
Palm Springs, Pro Classic, Leisure Life, Pro USA, and private label brand
names.  Leisure Life's furniture products are sold through independent
retailers, hardware store cooperatives and larger chains of home and garden
stores.  Palm Springs' products were sold through off-course golf specialty
shops.

The Company was organized under Delaware law on August 18, 1988.  Its
administrative office is located at 32751 Middlebelt Road, Suite B,
Farmington Hills, MI 48334, where its telephone number is (248) 851-5651.
The Company also operates a manufacturing and distribution facility at
215 4th Avenue North, Baxter, TN 38544, headquarters for its Leisure Life
subsidiary.

Business Strategies
--------------------
The Company's strategies are to improve its position as the global leader in
retail golf sales at its Pro Golf Discount franchised stores, and to develop a
golf category-killer website for internet sales of golf equipment and related
products and services.  The Company is also exploring other golf related
activities, including golf domes.  The Company believes that the following
competitive strengths contribute to its position as a market leader:

Strong Brand Recognition.    Pro Golf Discount ("PGD") is a highly recognized
name in the golf industry with more than 150 franchised stores operating in
the United States, Canada, the Philippines, and the Bahamas.  Pro Golf of
America, Inc. franchises the PGD stores and a significant portion of PGOA's
revenues result from franchise fees and royalties associated with these
stores.

From 1983 through 1998 a significant portion of the Company's revenues
resulted from the sale of golf products manufactured and sold pursuant to a
license agreement with Spalding Sports Worldwide ("Spalding"). In March 1999
the Company began an 18-month phase out of products bearing the Spalding name.
This phasing out process resulted in sharply decreased sales by the Company
during 1999 because Spalding had been the Company's primary brand sold to mass
merchants.  In June 2000 the Company discontinued its golf products
manufacturing operations.

Reputation for Quality.  The Company believes that the services it provides to
its franchisees equals or exceeds the performance of its competitors. Its Pro
Golf Discount franchised stores have an international reputation for quality
name brand and private label golf merchandise at the best prices.

Tradition of Innovation.  Throughout PGOA's history it has tried to maintain
a tradition of new product development for its private label golf merchandise
lines sold in the Pro Golf Discount stores.  The products are able to provide
the franchisees with quality golf products at competitive prices with higher
margins than name brand product lines and help fill out the product mix
carried in the stores.

Growth Opportunities
--------------------
The Company believes that PGD's strong brand recognition, reputation for
quality, and tradition of innovation position it to take advantage of
opportunities for future growth including:

Adding Value for Franchisees.  The main objective of PGOA is to increase
profitability of its PGD stores to ensure the long-term success of its
franchisees.  We are intent on strengthening our private label and exclusive
products offering to the stores to create improved margins and also work to
continually improve the relationships with golf product vendors. Synergies
between the stores and the internet will be developed to strengthen the Pro
Golf brand and help our stores better service the Pro Golf customers.
Stores will be provided with more profit-making opportunities.  Happy and
healthy franchisees will help fuel our expansion.

New Business Models.  We are currently developing new products that will
broaden the PGOA offerings and create new profit opportunities.  Business
models are being developed to: (a) franchise a bigger, more profitable model
which includes a golf dome and a retail store; (b) help our franchisees
broaden their golf services offered to local corporations, including golf
outing management and corporate premiums and ad specialty products;
(c) create overseas distribution for Excalibur and Unique, our proprietary
private label brands; and (d) open a "no frills" factory outlet store,
stressing closeouts and factory direct pricing, which would function as
a clearance center for our franchisees and for key vendor closeouts and
overstocks.

Increased Market Penetration.   The Company, through its subsidiaries PGOA
and PG.com, has aggressive expansion plans for 2001 and beyond.  The
expansion plans will require additional capital in order to be successfully
executed.  The plans include: purchasing a competitor, adding 18-24 new
franchised stores per year by aggressively recruiting new franchisees,
acquiring other independent specialty store chains and converting strong
independent competitors into Pro Golf Discount stores, expanding in
additional major markets in the United States, and using the internet to
drive more traffic to the PGD stores, helping the PGD stores to better
manage and control their inventory, and as a distribution channel to
sell golf equipment and golf-related services.

Golf Business
----------------
Golf, which is the primary market for the Company's businesses other than
Leisure Life, continues to be a popular form of recreation.   According to
the National Golf Foundation ("NGF"), a trade association, rounds of golf
played in 1999 reached the highest point ever, roughly 564 million, due to
an increase in average rounds played per golfer to 21.3.  The pace of golf
course development also continues steadily.   NGF reports that 1999
marked the fifth consecutive year where new golf course openings exceeded
400. According to NGF market research, the number of U. S. golfers
was approximately 26.4 million.   The NGF statistics show that in 1999, more
golfers were playing more rounds than ever before.  The population of
golfers in 1999 was 80.6% male and 19.4% female, with 78.1% between
the ages of 17 and 60.   In addition, favorable demographic trends
offer encouraging growth prospects for the retail golf equipment and
accessories industry both in terms of participation rate and number of
rounds.  The Company believes there is a great opportunity for increased
participation both by women and golfers under 18 and over 60, and that
there is a great opportunity for increased participation by minorities. These
beliefs are based on expected increased interest by younger players,
increased emphasis on women's golf, and improvements in health, leisure
time, increasing numbers of people moving into the over 60 age group, and
the success and increased visibility of minority golfers such as Tiger Woods
and Sergio Garcia.  In addition, favorable demographic trends offer
encouraging growth prospects for the retail golf equipment and accessories
industry both in terms of participation rate and number of rounds.

Marketing and Distribution.  PGOA services its franchisees through its
in-house support staff, and its staff routinely attends trade shows and
maintains close contact with outside vendors to keep PGD in the forefront of
golf and retail innovation and technology.  PGOA's franchisees spend
approximately $10 million annually on local and national advertising, which
helps expand recognition of the Pro Golf brand name. PG.com intends to
supplement this advertising with substantial advertising of its own beginning
in the latter half of 2001.  The Company believes that future success in golf
retailing will be dependent on being able to provide the customer with
information and product availability at any time and in any way that the
customer wants it.  Technology is changing the retail landscape and Pro
Golf believes its success will be enhanced by becoming a multi-channel
company that is accessible to customers on their terms.  This multi-channel
philosophy will enhance the way PGOA interacts with its franchisees and
also the way the PGD stores interact with customers.

Leisure Furniture Business
--------------------------
Leisure furniture, used on porches, decks, patios, in sun rooms and yards has
traditionally consisted of aluminum, resin, wrought iron and low to medium
priced wood products.  The designs of wood products have not been stylish
or particularly comfortable for seating.  Leisure Life's "In Motion"
furniture products, which feature contoured slings, adjustability and
comfort, have been received favorably in the leisure furniture market.

Leisure Life's furniture is constructed of a high-grade pine, which is
pressure-treated and kiln-dried to prevent deterioration, warping, and
bending and to withstand varying climate conditions.  The seating products
utilize a patented suspension seating system that permits simple adjustment
to accommodate users of different heights and weights.  This system also
incorporates an ergonomically designed sling and deep cushion seating to
provide lower back support.   A patented suspension system is used on swings,
rocking chairs, stationary chairs, love seats, and couches.

Manufacturing.  The pressure treated pine purchased by Leisure Life is planed,
cut, drilled, and sanded in the Baxter, Tennessee facility to form product
components.  Small portions of the wood pieces are purchased pre-
manufactured. Fabric for pillows, cushions, slings and canopies are cut
and sewn in-house and by third party subcontractors for final assembly in
the Baxter, Tennessee facility.  Furniture items are packaged in kits
containing the wood frame pieces, slings, pillows, and necessary hardware,
requiring the customer to assemble the final product.

Marketing and Distribution.  Currently, Leisure life supplies nearly 3,500
storefronts worldwide and supplies to 20 distributors in various countries
around the world.    Large chains such as Lowes and Price Costco represent
much of Leisure Life's customer storefront base and sales.   Independent
nurseries, hardware stores, pool and patio shops, home centers, department
stores, mail order catalogs and casual furniture stores, along with their
respective co-op's and specialty distributors carry Leisure Life swings,
swing sets, seating and rockers.   Export distribution also continues to
grow.

Inventories and Backlog
------------------------
Due to the relatively short lapse of time between placement of orders for
products and shipments, the Company normally does not consider its backlog of
leisure furniture orders to be significant to its business.  Because of rapid
delivery requirements of its customers, the Company maintains finished goods
inventories to provide acceptable service levels to its customers.  Inventory
turnover in mass-market products is lower than for furniture and reflects
maintenance of high service standards for its mass-market customer base and
the shorter manufacturing time cycle for furniture products.  To reflect the
seasonality of the business, inventories tend to be higher from November
to May.

Competition
------------
The market in which the Company does business, while very fragmented, is
highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established companies.
New product introductions and/or price reductions by competitors continue
to generate increased market competition.  While the Company believes its
franchised stores will continue to be competitive, there can be no assurance
that successful marketing efforts by competitors will not negatively impact
the Company's future revenues.  Additionally, the Company faces much
competition from other internet companies which sell golf equipment and
services similar to those PG.com will be offering, and at the present
time the Company believes that online sales of golf equipment is not a
material percentage of total golf sales.

Raw Materials and Components
-------------------------------
Leisure Life purchases pressure treated pine, fabric, cushion stuffing, and
miscellaneous hardware used in the manufacturing and assembly process from
domestic sources.  Alternative sources for raw materials are available and
Leisure Life has not experienced difficulty in obtaining raw materials.

Patents and Trademarks
----------------------
The Company owns several patents and trademarks and has proprietary knowledge
relating to its product lines.  The loss of any of the Company's patents or
trademarks may have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees
----------
As of March 31, 2001, the Company had a total of 33 employees: 15 employees
at its Farmington Hills, Michigan office and 18 employees at the Baxter,
Tennessee facility.  Leisure Life also was leasing 74 workers as of March 31,
2001. The Company considers its current relations with its employees to be
good.

Item 2.    Description of Property
           -----------------------
PGOA leases approximately 11,150 square feet of office space in Farmington
Hills, Michigan, under an operating lease with its former owners, of which
3,150 square feet is subleased to an affiliated company.  The lease is a
36-month operating lease that expires on March 31, 2002, with one option to
renew for an additional five years.  PGOA has an option, exercisable through
March 31, 2002, to purchase the building at fair market value.

Leisure Life owns its manufacturing, assembly, and warehouse facility in
Baxter, Tennessee, which consists of approximately 40,000 square feet of
manufacturing and warehousing space, located on 2.8 acres.   The property
carries a mortgage in the amount of $162,400.  Due to the planned sale or
discontinuance of operations, the building has been listed for sale with a
commercial real estate broker since June 2000.

These facilities adequately meet the Company's administrative and production
capacity requirements.  The Company, on average, utilizes approximately 60%
of its facility square footage.

Item 3.	Legal Proceedings
            ------------------
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are normal to its
businesses, including product liability and workers' compensation claims.
As a result of its tight cash flow, the Company is late on payments due to
several of its vendors and is involved in various collection actions against
it and may face additional actions of this type.  The Company believes
that none of this litigation is likely to have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition or operations. The Company faces the risk of
exposure to product liability claims if consumers using the Company's
products are injured in connection with their use.   While the Company will
continue to attempt to take appropriate precautions, there can be no
assurance that it will avoid significant product liability exposure.
Based on historical experience, Ajay, Leisure Life, Palm Springs,
Prestige, PGI, PGOA and PG.com have product liability insurance coverage,
which the Company believes is adequate.

Item 4.	Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
            ---------------------------------------------------
There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
fourth quarter.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
          Results of Operations
          -----------------------------------------------------------------

Results of Continuing Operations
--------------------------------
Net Sales

Net sales in 2000 were $4.3 million, compared to sales for the six months
ended December 31, 1999 of $1.7 million.  Management believes annualized
sales were comparable in 2000 versus 1999, as historically the better months
of the year would occur during the first half, which are the prime months
for the golf retail industry.  According to published reports, the golf
industry overall sales increased approximately 4% in 2000 over 1999,
so PGI's performance was in line with the industry.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $3.3 million compared to $1.1
million for the six months ended December 31, 1999.  The main cause for the
pro-rata increase were higher expenditures in 2000 for advertising,
commissions, and legal fees.  During the second half of 2000, the Company
began a cost reduction program designed to bring costs in line with the
reduced sales levels.

Interest Expense

Interest expense (net) for 2000 was $1,023,000, compared to $522,000 for the
ix months ended December 31, 1999.

Income Taxes

PGI had no income tax liability during the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999.  The tax loss for these years is expected to offset future taxable
income and reduce future income taxes.

Financial Condition of Continuing Operations
--------------------------------------------
At December 31, 2000, PGI had working capital of $34,000, compared with
$14,000 at December 31, 1999. This $20,000 increase resulted from increased
receivables due to slower payments on royalties from franchisees caused
primarily by a slowing economy and increased payables as a result of weaker
cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2000. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was 1.01.

Inventories at December 31, 2000 were $2,000 compared to $16,000 at
December 31, 1999.   The decrease reflects a write-down in the value of
Cadillac golf equipment on hand.  Receivables were $1.9 million at December
31, 2000 compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 1999. The increase is
due to an increase in royalties receivable from franchisees and an increase
in receivables from affiliated companies.

At December 31, 2000 and 1999, net fixed assets were $13.1 million and
$90,000, respectively.  The increase reflects the acquisition of golf real
 estate located in Birch Run, Michigan and vacant land in Vero Beach,
Florida. The land was listed for sale with commercial real estate brokers
during the fourth quarter of 2000.

Capital Resources
-----------------
The Company replaces its office furniture and equipment as needed, and
expenditures during 2000 were $23,000 plus an additional $145,000 for
development of the website for PG.com.

Liquidity
----------
Cash flow from operations for 2000 was $1,661,000 for the Pro Golf operating
companies.   The Company expects that cash flow from operations will continue
to be sufficient to cover the operating expenses and debt requirements
of the franchise operations during the first half of 2001.   However, as
certain liabilities of affiliated companies are also being paid out of
the Pro Golf cash flow through intercompany loans, liquidity of the operating
companies is expected to be under severe stress until the Company is able to
refinance its debt and raise funds for expansion.

The Company's liquidity varies with the seasonality of its business, which,
in turn, influences its financing requirements.  The seasonal nature of the
Company's royalty revenue creates fluctuating cash flow.  The Company has
relied on internally generated cash from operating activities to fund its
operations and pay its debt.  The Company is also relying on cash generated
from private placements of stock in PGI and PG.com to fund the further
development of the website and future expansion of Pro Golf.

During late 1999 and into 2000, the Company sold equity in PGI in a private
placement offering and entered into an agreement to acquire developed and
undeveloped real estate for existing and planned golf-related activities.
During 2000, the Company issued 129,084 shares of PGI stock, which represents
11.4% of the total shares of PGI stock outstanding at December 31, 2000.
Of the new shares issued, $318,000 cash had been received with signed
subscription documents, $927,000 was a conversion of subordinated debt and
related accrued interest into common stock, and the remaining $6,500,000
was for the acquisition of golf-related real property.

The Company also began an offering of PG.com common stock during November
2000 to raise up to $12,500,000 in gross offering proceeds.  If the maximum
offering is sold, the shares sold in this offering will represent
approximately 33% of the total PG.com common shares outstanding after the
offering.  Proceeds from these private placements will be used for working
capital, acquisitions, and growth.  As of May 18, 2001, the Company had
received $2,042,000 from this offering.

The Company had anticipated significant additional cash flows resulting from
The rents and fees to be received from the golf properties during the initial
twelve-month period beginning July 1, 2000. Rental income totaling $333,000
was accrued for the period July 1, 2000 through October 31, 2000.  At that
time, the real estate was listed for sale with a commercial real estate
broker.  The rental income receivable is expected to be paid to the Company
at the time the real estate is sold.

The company is also negotiating master licensing agreements in foreign
 countries, to permit others to use its name in various geographic locations,
for upfront licensing fees and/or ongoing licensing and royalty payments.
Additionally, the dome and retail store combination is planned as a new PGOA
franchise model and, if successful, could substantially increase revenues
and cash flow of the Company's franchise operations.  The Company is also
planning to open at least one Company-owned golf dome and Company-owned
retail store as funds become available.

Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
           ----------------------------------------------------------
The Company holds only one market risk instrument.  This is common stock
 classified as marketable securities available-for-sale and included in the
"net liabilities of discontinued operations" amount as an asset of $147,000
as of December 31, 2000.  This stock is subject to equity price risk. The
full carrying value represents the market value of 156,719 shares of Williams
Controls, Inc. common stock valued at $.9375 per share, which is the last
reported trade price for 2000. This stock is traded on the Nasdaq national
market. The shares were received as part of the restructuring agreement with
Williams dated June 30, 1998. These shares have been pledged to Wells Fargo as
collateral for the Company's loans.  High and low closing prices per share
for the Williams common stock for 2000 were $2.44 and $0.44 respectively.
Between January 1, 2001 and March 31, 2001 the lowest closing price for
These shares was $0.94 per share.

Directors are not paid any fees for serving on the Board of Directors or
attending Board of Directors meetings. However, they are reimbursed for
expenses incurred in attending such board meetings.

Under the 1994 Stock Option Plan, the non-employee directors who are members
of the Compensation Committee are to receive grants of 834 non-statutory stock

Item 13   Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
          ------------------------------------------------
Since 1994, Williams Controls, Inc. has made loans and provided capital to
the Company to assist the Company in meeting its financing requirements.
Williams owns 686,274 shares of the Company's common stock.  Thomas W.
Itin, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and
beneficial owner of approximately 49.5% of the Company's common stock,
is also the Chairman and beneficial owner of approximately 29.4%of
the common stock of Williams.  Mr. Itin was the President, Chief
Executive Officer, and Treasurer of Williams until January 4, 2001.

From July 1997 to July 1998, the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Company
parties") were parties with Williams and its subsidiaries (the "Williams
parties") to a joint credit facility from Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the "Joint Wells Loan").  The proceeds of this joint financing
were used to repay the loans of the Williams parties and partially repay
loans of the Company parties from a previous bank lender, United States
National Bank ("U. S. Bank").  In connection with the Joint Wells Loan,
Williams provided the Company a loan in the amount of $2,268,000 (the
"Williams Bridge Loan") and U. S. Bank provided the Company a bridge loan
in the amount of $2,340,000 (the "USB Bridge Loan"). The Company is the
primary obligor on the USB Bridge Loan promissory note and it is guaranteed
in full by the Williams parties, and by the Company's Chairman, personally,
up to $1,000,000.

As of June 30, 1998, the Joint Wells Loan was restructured to separate the
loans to the Company parties and the Williams parties.  This restructuring
eliminated joint and several liability to Wells, as well as cross collateral
and guarantee agreements, between the Company parties and the Williams
parties as they related to the Joint Wells Loan. The Company's credit
facility with Wells allowed the Company parties to borrow up to the
lesser of $9,500,000 or the Borrowing Base (as defined in the credit
agreement).

In connection with the transaction with Wells to separate the loans of the
Company parties and the Williams parties effected June 30, 1998, Williams
(a)advanced an additional $2,000,000 in the form of cash and marketable
securities, (b) purchased notes payable of approximately $948,000 by the
Company to other affiliated parties, Enercorp, Inc. and First Equity
Corporation, which evidenced loans provided by those parties during 1997
when the Company required additional capital, (c) and converted $5,000,000 of
the amount owed by the Company to Williams into 6,000,000 shares of a newly
created class of preferred stock of the Company, its Series D cumulative
convertible preferred stock. In connection with these transactions with
Williams, the Company delivered a promissory note to Williams for the full
amount owed to Williams after conversion of $5,000,000 into the Series D
preferred stock (the "Williams Note").  The Williams Note is secured by
a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company parties, which
lien is subordinate to the liens of U. S. Bank and Wells.

The Williams note accrues interest at the rate of 16% per annum.  As
currently structured, the interest became payable on December 31, 2000,
and all remaining principal and interest will be due at maturity on August 1,
2001. The Company was not able to pay the loan interest that came due on
2002. December 31, 2000.  At December 31, 2000, the Company owed $2,087,000
under the Williams Note.  In addition, it owed $1,315,000 to U. S. Bank
under the USB Bridge Loan.  The Company has been unable to meet its repayment
obligations under the USB Bridge Loan and if Williams agrees to and makes
payments on the USB Bridge Loan on the Company's behalf, either on its own
or as a guarantor, any payments made by Williams would result in an increase
in the amount the Company owes to Williams.  The Company has been operating
under a forbearance agreement with U.S. Bank that expired on October 31,
2000. The Company was notified by U.S. Bank that it intended to foreclose
2000. on April 23, 2001 on its collateral and the loan guarantors.
2000. As of May 9, 2001 no action has been taken by U.S. Bank.

The Series D preferred stock is convertible at the option of Williams into
3,333,333 shares of the Company's common stock.  No dividends accrue on the
Series D preferred stock until after July 31, 2001.  The dividend rate on the
Series D preferred stock will be 17% per annum commencing August 1, 2001 and
will increase to 24% in 2002.  The Series D preferred stock is redeemable by
the Company.  It is not likely that the Company will be able to raise capital
from new sources in order to redeem the Series D preferred stock prior to
August 1, 2001.

The Company had also entered into agreements with Williams that required
annual payments of $90,000 for administrative fees and $80,000 for
management fees for sourcing products overseas on the Company's behalf.
These payments were accrued through September 30, 2000 by the Company and are
currently being negotiated due to the discontinuance of the businesses that
needed the sourcing during 2000.

During 1999, Williams reimbursed the Company approximately $114,000 for
management services provided to Williams by an officer of the Company
from 1997 through 1998.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT




To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Ajay Sports, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ajay Sports,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for the years then ended.   These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.  The consolidated financial statements of Ajay Sports,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 were audited by other
auditors whose report dated March 12, 1999 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those statements.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.   An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Ajay Sports, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The information on Schedule II is
presented for purposes of complying with rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is not a required part of the basic financial statements.
This information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in
our audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
states in all material respects the 2000 and 1999 financial data required
to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as whole.

                        AJAY SPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     --------------------------------


  	BASIS OF PRESENTATION - The consolidated financial statements include the
      accounts of Ajay Sports, Inc. ("Sports") and its wholly-owned operating
      company subsidiaries, Ajay Leisure Products, Inc. ("Ajay"), Leisure
      Life, Inc. ("Leisure"), Palm Springs Golf, Inc. ("Palm Springs"),
      Prestige Golf Corp. ("Prestige"), and majority-owned subsidiaries
      Pro Golf International, Inc. ("PGI"), Pro Golf of America, Inc.
      ("PGOA"), and ProGolf.com, Inc. ("PG.com") collectively referred to
      herein as the "Company".  All significant intercompany balances and
      transactions have been eliminated.

	DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - The operations of Ajay, Leisure, Palm Springs,
      and Prestige were discontinued on June 2, 2000.  From that date through
      December 31, 2000 the companies in the golf wholesale segment (Ajay,
      Palm Springs, and Prestige) liquidated their remaining assets.  Leisure
      scaled back its operations and was put up for sale.  The Balance Sheet
      for December 31, 2000 reflects the excess of the liabilities over the
      assets of these subsidiaries.  The Balance Sheet for December 31,
      1999 has not been restated.  The Statement of Operations has been
      restated for prior years in accordance with APB 30. As of December 31,
      2000 the remaining assets and liabilities of the golf wholesale
      companies were written off.  Leisure is still operating and purchase
      offers are being reviewed.

      REVENUE RECOGNITION - PGOA recognizes Initial Franchise Fee revenue
      when all material services or conditions relating to the sale have been
      substantially performed or satisfied by the franchiser.  Royalty fees
      in most cases are a percentage of franchisees monthly gross receipts,
      as defined in the franchise agreement.   Leisure and the golf wholesale
      companies recognized revenue from sales of product when title to the
      product had passed, which was generally the date the product was shipped.

      NATURE OF SIGNIFICANT INITIAL SERVICES - When a franchise is purchased
      from PGOA, the company agrees to perform certain services to the new
      franchisee.  Among the services provided by PGOA are assistance in
      lease negotiation, store layout, retail sales training, custom club
      fitting, implementation of an accounting system, purchasing and pricing
      programs, and design of a customer service program.

      CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - The Company maintains cash balances at
      several banks.  Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal
      Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $100,000. Balances maintained
      frequently exceed $100,000.  Management feels that the risk of loss
      due to excess balances is minimal.

      INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
      with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method.

      FIXED ASSETS - Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated
      depreciation.  Fixed assets of the Company consist primarily of land,
      machinery and equipment, office equipment, and a building.
      Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
      estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to
      thirty-nine years. The land is not being depreciated.

      GOODWILL  - The Company had recorded goodwill as a result of the
      1995 acquisitions of Palm Springs and Korex.  The goodwill was being
      amortized over forty years and due to the discontinuance of the
      operations of Ajay in June 2000, was written off in full at that time.
      Amortization expense related to the goodwill was $1,752,000 for the
      year ended December 31, 2000.

      OTHER ASSETS - Other assets at December 31, 2000 and 1999 consists
      primarily of trademarks and brand names held by PGI.  Amortization
      expense is being deducted straight-line over the estimated useful
      lives of these assets.  Amortization expense related to the other
      assets was $269,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.

      PRODUCT LIABILITY AND WARRANTY COSTS - Product liability exposure is
      insured with insurance premiums provided during the year.  Product
      warranty costs are based on experience and the Company attempts to
      match such costs with the related product sales.

      INCOME TAXES - Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for
      Income Taxes.  Under SFAS No. 109, deferred income taxes are
      recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between
      the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of
      existing assets and liabilities, using enacted statutory rates
      applicable to future years.

      ADVERTISING - The Company's policy is to expense production costs for
      advertising as of the date the commercials and marketing materials are
      initially utilized or are provided to franchisees for their use.
      Prepaid advertising represents expenditures that, under this policy,
      are capitalized at period end and are expensed during a subsequent
      period as utilized.  Due to the seasonality of the Company's business,
      advertising and marketing costs generally exceed revenue received
      from vendors and franchisees on an annual basis.  The Company incurred
      $661,115 of costs for advertising and the production of marketing
      materials during the year ended December 31, 2000.

      EMPLOYEE BONUS PLAN - The Company has a non-qualified bonus plan for
      certain employees.  Due to the seasonal nature of the Company's
      business and the timing of revenue and expenses, on an interim basis,
      the Company expenses compensation related to the bonus as it is paid
      during the year.  The bonus is determined at the end of the fiscal year
      based on annual financial results.

      COMPENSATED ABSENCES - Employees of the Company are entitled to paid
      vacation and paid sick days off depending on job classification,
      length of service, and other factors.  It is impracticable to
      estimate the amount of compensation for future absences, and,
      accordingly, no liability has been recorded in the accompanying
      financial statements.  The company's policy is to record the costs of
      compensated absences when actually paid to employees.

      STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS - The Company considers all bank accounts to be
      cash equivalents. The impact of changing foreign currencies on cash was
      not material.

      USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
      with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
      make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
      assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
      liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
      amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
      results could differ from those estimates.

      COMMON STOCK  - The Company reverse split its common stock in a 1-for-6
      ratio effective with commencement of trading on August 14, 1998.  As a
      result of this transaction, all historic data in the financial
      statements that reference common shares, options, earnings per share or
      preferred conversion ratios have been restated to reflect this split
      as if it preceded all prior reporting.   Historic actual common shares
      outstanding at December 31, 1997 were 23,274,039 and were restated to
      3,879,007.


2.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
     --------------------------
     The Company's related parties include the following:

     First Equity Corporation ("First Equity") - First Equity is owned by a
     family member of the president, chief executive officer, and chairman of
     the Company.   First Equity held, at December 31, 1997, demand notes in
     the amount of $748,000 as a result of loans made to the company in 1996
     and 1997. Williams assumed these notes in the financial restructuring
     in 1998.  First Equity made short-term working capital loans to Ajay
     during 1999, with interest at various market rates. The balance due on
     these loans at December 31, 2000 was $569,745, including accrued
     interest of $50,250.  A total of $50,000 was repaid during
     January 2001.

     Enercorp, Inc.  ("Enercorp") - is a business development company engaged
     in the business of investing in and providing managerial assistance to
     developing companies.  The Company's president, chief executive officer,
     chairman and principal shareholder is a significant shareholder in
     Enercorp.  Enercorp holds 310,787 common shares acquired in 1994 and
     1995 and 2,000 shares of series C preferred stock. Enercorp held at
     December 31, 1997, demand notes in the amount of $200,000 as a result of
     loans made to the Company.  Williams assumed these notes in the financial
     restructuring in 1998.  During 1999, Enercorp loaned PGI $420,000 under
     a 13 month, 10% subordinated note.  In February 2000, Enercorp converted
     the note and accrued interest of $27,000 into 7,450 shares of PGI at $60
     each.

     Williams Controls, Inc. ("Williams") - Williams has the same chairman as
     the Company, which individual is a major shareholder of each company.
     Williams owns 686,274 shares of the Company's common stock, and
     6,000,000 shares of Series D cumulative convertible preferred stock as
     of December 31, 2000, convertible into 3,333,333 shares of the
     Company's common stock.  From July 11, 1997 through June 30, 1998 the
     Company and Williams shared a joint and several loan obligation.  On
     June 30, 1998, the Company restructured its credit facility with Wells
     Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells")to separate its credit facility from that of
     Williams.  As a result of this transaction, the Company no longer has
     joint and several liability, cross collateral agreements or
     guarantees with Williams.  In connection with the restructuring of the
     Wells credit facility, the Company was advanced $2,000,000 additional
     funds by Williams in the form of a long-term note and marketable
     securities and Williams converted $5,000,000 of Company debt into a
     newly created series D cumulative  convertible preferred stock.

     The Company's interest expense accrued to Williams was $452,127 and
     $251,545 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 respectively.
     During 1999, $62,900 of the interest accrual was actually paid.
     (See Note 4).

     The Company received 166,719 shares of Williams as part of the
     restructuring agreement with Williams dated June 30, 1998.  The remaining
     156,719 shares have been pledged to Wells Fargo as collateral for the
     Company's loans.  The common stock is classified as marketable
     securities - available for sale and is valued at $.9375 per share,
     which is the last trade for 2000.

     Due to poor cash flow, the Company has been unable to make any principal
     or interest payments to Williams on these loan since 1999 and is in
     default on its obligations to Williams.  As of May 18, 2001, Williams
     has been forbearing upon the Company's default; however, there is no
     assurance that this forbearance will continue.  The Company's Chief
     Executive Officer had guaranteed to Williams its investments in and
     loans to the Company; however, there is uncertainty as to whether the
     guarantee is still in place due to control changes at Williams during
     2000 and 2001.

     During 1999, the Company had borrowings from affiliated parties, in
     addition to those mentioned above, to finance its acquisition of PGOA
     and PG.com.  These borrowings totaled $450,000, with interest at an
     annual rate of 10%.  In February 2000, these borrowings (and accrued
     interest totaling $30,000) were converted into 8,000 shares of PGI
     common stock at $60 per share.

3.    INVENTORIES
      ------------
      Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):

                                       December 31

                                  ========       ========

Additionally, at December 31, 2000 the Company's furniture business had
inventory totaling $211,000, consisting of $55,000 in raw materials, $68,000
of work in process, and $88,000 of finished goods.  The overall reduction in
inventory that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2000 was due to
the discontinuing of the wholesale golf segment.

4. DEBT
------

On December 31, 2000 the Company's debt for continuing operations was
$16,125,000 owed to banks, Williams, affiliates and others.  This
compares to $19,038,000 for December 31, 1999.  The decrease from 1999
is principally due to the discontinuance of the unprofitable wholesale
golf segment of the Company's business.

From July 11, 1997 until June 30, 1998 the Company shared in a combined credit
agreement with Williams (the "Joint Loan").    As of June 30, 1998 the Company
restructured its credit facility with Wells to separate from the joint and
several credit facility with Williams. This new credit facility eliminated
cross collateral and guarantee agreements involving the Company and Williams.
The revolving loan facility allowed the Company to borrow up to the lesser of
$9,500,000 or the Borrowing Base.  The Borrowing Base consisted of a formula
including certain eligible receivables, inventories and letters of credit at
rates established by Wells.

The proceeds from the Joint Loan were used to repay the Company's and
Williamsthen outstanding loans from the previous lender, U. S. Bank, except
for a bridge loan in the total amount of $2,140,000 to the Company by U. S.
Bank.  This bridge loan is to be repaid from the sale of assets and/or excess
cash flows of Williams and/or the Company, and is guaranteed up to $1,000,000
by the Company's president. The balance owed on this bridge loan at December
31, 2000 is $1,315,000.    In connection with the 1998 credit facility
restructuring, the Company was advanced $2,000,000 of additional funds by
Williams and Williams converted $5,000,000 of company debt into preferred
stock.

At December 31, 2000 the Company was liable to Comerica Bank in the amount of
$8,425,000 on a master revolving note entered into to effect the acquisition
of Pro Golf of America, Inc. and ProGolf.com, Inc.  The note has been
extended through June 30, 2001 under a forbearance agreement.  The Company
anticipates refinancing this loan into an amortizing long-term loan during
the second half of 2001, and anticipates receiving additional short-term loan
extensions from Comerica, although there is not a commitment on the part of
Comerica to grant any further extensions after June 30 2001.

The Company's Bank borrowings for continuing operations consisted of the
following (dollars in thousands):


                                              December 31,

	 Average amount outstanding
	 during the period                $	 8,425         $   8,479


      Debt payments for continuing operations are estimated to be as
      scheduled (dollars in thousands):

	               2001                  $    1,200
                     2002                       1,200
                     2003                       1,200
                     2004                       1,200
                     2005 and thereafter       11,325

     The seasonal nature of the Company's revenues creates fluctuating demands
     on its cash flow. The Company has relied and continues to rely heavily on
     the internal cash flow for its golf franchising business.  New capital
     will need to be raised for the planned expansion of Pro Golf (See
     Note 14.)

5.   INCOME TAXES
     ------------
     As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109 at the beginning
     of 1992.  There was no cumulative effect of this accounting change and
     its adoption had no impact on 1992 net income.

     The actual income tax expense (benefit) differs from the statutory income
     tax expense (benefit) as follows (in thousands):

     At December 31, 2000, the Company assessed its past earnings history
     and trends, budgeted sales, and expiration dates of carry forwards
     and has determined that it is more likely than not that 100% of
     deferred tax assets will be realized.  The change versus 1998 is
     principally due to the profits to be realized from operations of PGOA
     and PG.com and the discontinuance of the Company's unprofitable
     operations in the golf wholesale segment and leisure furniture
     segment.  The valuation allowance of $502,000 at December 31, 1998
     was maintained on deferred tax assets, which the Company had
     determined to be more likely than not unrealizable at that time.

     The Company had net operating loss carry forwards for Federal tax
     purposes of approximately $20,077,000 at December 31, 2000, which
     expire in varying amounts in the years 2006 through 2020. Substantial
     operating loss carry forwards are available to offset future state
     taxable income of the Company, which expire in varying amounts in the
     years 2006 through 2020.  Future changes in ownership, as defined by
     section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, could limit the amount of
     net operating loss carry forwards used in any one year.

4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
   --------------------

(a)   Preferred Stock

      The Company has 12,500 shares of Preferred Series B stock outstanding,
      with a conversion rate as of December 31, 2000 of 92.5926 common shares
      for each share of preferred stock.

      In July 1995 the Company sold 325,000 shares of Series C 10% cumulative
      convertible preferred stock and 325,000 warrants in a registered public
      offering.  The Series C preferred stock is convertible into shares of
      the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of 2.42424 common shares
      for each share of preferred stock.  Cumulative dividends are payable on
      the Series C preferred stock at an annual rate of $1.00 per share.
      The warrants are redeemable by the Company at $0.05 per warrant under
      certain conditions.  The terms of these warrants are identical to the
      Company's publicly held warrants to purchase common stock.   In 1995
      the Company used the $2.8 million of net proceeds for inventory and
      accounts receivable financing and to acquire certain assets of Korex
      and Palm Springs.

      At December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, dividends in arrears on the 8%
      cumulative convertible preferred Series B stock were $1,206,575,
      $1,106,575 and $1,006,575 respectively.   Dividends on the Series C
      cumulative convertible preferred stock were declared and paid through
      December 31, 1996.  No dividends were declared or paid for 2000, 1999,
      or 1998.  At December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, dividends in arrears
      on the 10% cumulative convertible preferred Series C stock were
      $1,058,292, $817,232 and $576,174.    The Company has dedicated all
      available funds to support continuing operations of the Company until
      sufficient cash availability allows declaration and payment of
      dividends.

(b)   Stock issued to officers

      The Company has a stock incentive plan for officers of the Company,
      under which up to 150,000 shares of the Company's stock may be
      granted annually.   As of May 18, 2001, no stock has been issued to
      officers under this plan in 2000, 1999, or 1998.

(c)   Warrants and Options

      A summary of activity related to warrants and options to purchase
      Company common stock is as follows:

      and the six months ended December 31, 1999, respectively.

4. NET  (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE
----------------------------

      Earnings or loss per share has been computed by dividing net income or
      loss, after reduction for preferred stock dividends in 2000 ($341,000),
      1999 ($341,000), and 1998 ($380,000), by the weighted average number
      of common shares outstanding.   No exercise of outstanding warrants was
      assumed in 2000, 1999, or 1998, since any exercise of warrants would be
      antidilutive.

      SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share", became effective for fiscal years
      ending after December 15, 1997. This statement replaces the presentation
      of primary earnings per share ("EPS") with a presentation of basic EPS.
      It also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face
      of the income statement for all entities with complex capital
      structures and requires reconciliation of the numerator and denominator
      of the basic EPS computations to the numerator and denominator of the
      diluted EPS computation.   Basic EPS excludes dilution.   Diluted EPS
      reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
      contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
      stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared the
      earnings of the entity.


4. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
----------------------------------

      Cash paid by the Pro Golf operating companies for interest was $964,242
      during 2000 and $522,194 for the six months ended December 31, 1999.

      Non cash financing and investing transactions were as follows:

      During 1998 preferred stock in the quantity of 31,993 shares were
      converted into 77,558 shares of common stock.

      During 1998 long-term debt of $5,000,000 was converted into 6,000,000
      shares of Series D preferred stock.

      The Company added new leases during 1998 that represented asset values,
      if purchased, of approximately $103,000 and result in annual lease
      payments of $27,000 and with terms expiring up to the year 2003.
      These leases were terminated during 2000.

      During 1999 Series C preferred stock in the quantity of 46,238 shares
      were converted into 112,085 shares of common stock.

      The Company borrowed $10,750,000 from a bank and others to acquire
      PGOA and acquired PGD Online, LLC during 1999.

      During 2000 the Company issued 29,276 shares of its common stock to a
      vendor in payment of a debt.

      During 2000 the Company transferred 250 shares of stock that it owned
      in a subsidiary company to a vendor in payment of a debt.

      In July 2000, the Company acquired golf real estate in Birch Run,
      Michigan and vacant land in Vero Beach, Florida in exchange for
      108,334 shares of common stock of its Pro Golf International, Inc.
      subsidiary. If purchased the land would have been valued at. The
      estimated fair market value of the property acquired was $13,000,000
      less related debt of $6,500,000.

4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
-----------------------------
      The Company is subject to certain claims in the normal course of
      business which management intends to vigorously contest.   The
      outcomes of these claims are not expected to have a material
      adverse affect on the Company's consolidated financial position
      or results of operations.   (See Notes 4 and 9).

4. ACQUISITIONS
--------------

      In June 1999, Ajay, through a newly formed majority owned subsidiary
      (PGI) acquired 100% of the outstanding ownership interests of PGOA
      and PG.com.  This acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
      method of accounting.  The results of operations of the acquired
      companies have been included in Ajay's consolidated financial
      statements from the date of acquisition.  Intercompany accounts and
      transactions between the acquired companies and Ajay have been
      eliminated.

      The acquisition price of $10,500,000 was paid in cash and financed
      through borrowings with a bank ($8,500,000) affiliated companies
      ($870,000) and private individuals ($1,200,000).   The portion of the
      purchase price in excess of net book value was allocated to
      "Trademarks" and, net of the related income tax benefit and related
      trademark amortization, is shown in the consolidated balance sheet with
      "Other assets".

12.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
      ------------------------
      In June 2000, the Company decided on a plan of liquidation for its Ajay,
      Palm Springs, Prestige, and Leisure Life subsidiaries.  The operations
      of Ajay, Palm Springs, and Prestige (the "golf wholesale segment")
      ceased on August 31, 2000, at which time substantially all of the
      operating assets were liquidated.  The Company is in the final stages
      of collecting the receivables of those companies, and a reserve has been
      set up to estimate uncollectible accounts.  PGOA is loaning funds to
      Prestige so that certain liabilities to golf vendors can be paid.
      Leisure Life (the "furniture segment") reduced its operating expenses
      and its assets were listed with a broker for sale.  These companies
      had been incurring substantial losses during recent years and
      experiencing negative cash flows.  The results of these segments have
      been reported separately as discontinued operations in the Statements
      of Operations. Prior year operating results for 1999 and 1998 have
      been restated to present the operations of the golf wholesale segment
      and the leisure furniture segment as discontinued operations.  Prior
      year balance sheet and cash flows statements have not been restated.

      The net assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations have been
      recorded at net realizable value under the caption "Net liabilities of
      discontinued operations" in the accompanying Balance Sheet at December
      31, 2000 and consist of the following (in thousands):

	       Accounts receivable               $    434
	       Inventories                            211
	       Property and equipment, net            896
	       Other assets                         3,663
                                               --------
             Total assets                         5,204

	       Accounts payable                     2,209
	       Accrued liabilities                  1,260
	       Other liabilities                    1,609
	       Loans payable                        7,214
                                               --------
                 Total liabilities               12,292

	       Net liabilities of discontinued
               Operations                      $  7,088
                                              =========
      Sales of the golf wholesale segment (Ajay, Palm Springs, and Prestige)
      were $3.2 million, $6.8 million and $19.1 million for 2000, 1999 and
      1998 respectively.  Sales of Leisure Life were $4.3 million,  $4.8
      million and $3.8 million for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

13.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
      -----------------------------
      In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Committee of the American
      Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position
      ("SOP") 98-1, "Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or
      Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1 provides guidance for an enterprise
      on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained
      for internal use.  The Company adopted this statement during the year
      ended December 31, 1999 and has capitalized software costs according
      to the provisions of the standard.  These costs are amortized on a
      straight-line basis over the useful life of the software once it is
      placed into service.

      In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities".  This statement establishes
      accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
      hedging activities.  The statement was amended by SFAS No. 137 and
      will be effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning
      after June 15, 2000. The Company believes SFAS No. 133 will not have a
      material impact on its financial statements or accounting policies.
      The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 133 in the first
      quarter of 2001.

14.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
      ------------------
      During late 2000, the Company began selling equity in ProGolf.com in a
      private placement offering. The private placement expires June 30, 2001
      but may be extended by the Company at its discretion.   As of May
      17, 2001, the Company had committed to issue 791,272 shares of PG.com
      stock sold in this offering, which represents 6.8% of the total shares
      of PG.com stock outstanding at that date.

      An endorsement agreement between Gary Player Group, Inc. and PGOA was
      terminated as of January 12, 2001.  Management maintains any amount due
      above the contract is unlikely and feels no need to establish a
      contingent liability.

      Effective April 1, 2001 PGI obtained an extension through June 30, 2001
      on its master revolving note with Comerica Bank.   PGI anticipates
      refinancing this loan into a long-term amortizing loan during the second
      half of 2001.

      During May 2001 the Company engaged a strategic banker in order to raise
      new equity and debt capital so that the Company can refinance its
      existing debt, have capital for expansion, and have sufficient working
      capital.  The agreement entered into requires monthly retainer payments
      and for success fees to be paid when the capital is raised. The success
      fees are a percentage of the equity and debt capital raised.

EXHIBIT 10.5(b)

                           EXTENSION AGREEMENT

This Extension Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into on
September ___, 2000, between U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ("U.S. Bank")
And AJAY SPORTS, INC. ("Ajay").

                                 RECITALS

A.	On or about July 14, 1997, Ajay and U.S. Bank entered into
a Consent, Reaffirmation, and Release Agreement (the "Existing Loan
Agreement").

B.	Pursuant to the terms of the Existing Loan Agreement,
U.S. Bank provided a term loan facility to Ajay.  Capitalized terms used in
this Agreement that are not defined herein have the meanings assigned to
those terms in the Existing Loan Agreement.

C.	Ajay's obligations to repay the term loan extended by
U.S. Bank are set forth in a promissory note dated July 14, 1997, in the
principal amount of $2,340,000 (the "Note").  As of September 26, 2000, Ajay
owes U.S. Bank the principal amount of $1,314,537.80 and accrued interest of
$49,550.78 pursuant to the Note.

D.	Interest continues to accrue on Ajay's obligations to
U.S. Bank pursuant to the Note on and after September 27, 2000.  In addition,
Ajay is obligated to reimburse U.S. Bank (or pay directly if requested to do
so by U.S. Bank) for fees and costs reasonably incurred by U.S. Bank in
connection with its banking relationship with Ajay, including reasonable
attorney fees.

E.	The debts and obligations of Ajay to U.S. Bank pursuant to
the Existing Loan Agreement and the Note are referred to below as the
"Indebtedness."

F.	The Indebtedness is secured by security interests and liens
in the Collateral described in the Collateral Documents and by a lien on the
Florida Property described in the Aptek Mortgage.

G.	Williams, the Williams Guarantors, and the Ajay Guarantors
guaranteed payment of the Indebtedness pursuant to the terms of the
Guaranties.  In addition, Thomas W. Itin guaranteed payment of $1,000,000 of
the principal amount owed pursuant to the Note, and certain other sums,
pursuant to a guaranty agreement dated July 14, 1997 (the "Itin Guaranty").
Williams, the Williams Guarantors, the Ajay Guarantors, and Mr. Itin are
referred to in this Agreement collectively as the "Guarantors."

H.	The Existing Loan Agreement, the Note, the Collateral
Documents, the Aptek Mortgage, the Guaranties, the Itin Guaranty, and the
other documents executed by Ajay and the Guarantors in favor of U.S. Bank are
referred to herein as the "Loan Documents."

I.	The loan evidenced by the Note matured on July 1, 2000.
Ajay has asked U.S. Bank to extend the maturity date of the Note.  U.S. Bank
is willing to do so, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which hereby are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows

                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                SECTION I

EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE

1.1 Acknowledgment of Amounts Owed.  Ajay hereby acknowledges
and agrees that the amounts of principal and interest specified in Recital C
above with respect to the Note are payable to U.S. Bank without offset,
defense, counterclaim, or claim of recoupment.  In addition, Ajay
acknowledges its obligation to pay U.S. Bank the amounts referred to in
Recital D of this Agreement.

1.2 Amendment of the Note.  Contemporaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, Ajay shall execute and deliver to U.S. Bank a
document in form and content reasonably satisfactory to U.S. Bank amending
the Note (the "Note Amendment Agreement") to reflect the revised maturity
date thereof.  Following the execution of this Agreement and the Note
Amendment Agreement by Ajay, references in the Existing Loan Agreement to the
Note shall mean the Note, as amended by the Note Amendment Agreement.

1.3 Payment of Interest.  Contemporaneously with the execution
of this Agreement, Ajay shall pay U.S. Bank $38,632.81, which is the amount
of interest accrued on the Note through August 31, 2000.  On October 1, 2000,
Ajay shall pay U.S. Bank all interest accrued on the Note from September 1,
2000, through September 30, 2000.

1.4 New Maturity Date of the Note.  The maturity date of the
Note hereby is extended to October 31, 2000.  The entire balance of principal
outstanding under the Note, and all interest accrued thereon, shall be due
and payable in full by Ajay on October 31, 2000.

1.5 Withdrawal of Demand Upon Mr. Itin.  If the conditions
precedent set forth in Section II of this Agreement are satisfied by Ajay in
a timely manner and this Agreement becomes effective, U.S. Bank's outstanding
demand upon Mr. Itin to pay the portion of the Indebtedness that Mr. Itin
guaranteed under the Itin Guaranty shall be withdrawn.  If those conditions
precedent are not timely satisfied, U.S. Bank may proceed to exercise its
rights and remedies against Mr. Itin and any other person or entity with
respect to the Indebtedness.  If U.S. Bank's demand upon Mr. Itin is
withdrawn in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph, and Ajay
subsequently fails to make any payment owed pursuant to the Note (including
the payment of the remaining balance of principal and interest due on
October 31, 2000, if the extension contemplated in this Agreement is
granted), U.S. Bank may exercise any and all rights available to it against
Ajay and the Guarantors (or any of them), including, but not limited to, the
right to make demand again upon Mr. Itin and proceed against him under the
Itin Guaranty if that demand is not satisfied.

                                   SECTION II

COLLATERAL FOR THE INDEBTEDNESS

3.1 Continued Validity of the Collateral Documents.  Ajay
hereby expressly reaffirms and acknowledges the validity of the Collateral
Documents, the accuracy of the information contained in those documents, and
the grant of security interests and liens in favor of U.S. Bank in the

deemed necessary or desirable by U.S. Bank to evidence, perfect, or continue
U.S. Bank's security interests or liens in the Collateral.  The failure of

3.	Borrowers', Guarantor's, and Pledgor's Acknowledgments.
3.1 Borrowers, Guarantor and Pledgor each hereby acknowledges and agrees as
follows:
(a) Borrowers are obligated to Wells Fargo pursuant to the Loan
     Documents, and as of November 30, 2000 the outstanding principal

(b) The Loan Documents are legal, valid and binding obligations of
     each Borrower enforceable in accordance with their terms and there

      binding obligation of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its

      under the Guaranty.
3.3 Pledgor hereby acknowledges that the Pledge Agreement is a legal, valid
      and binding obligation of Pledgor enforceable in accordance with its
      terms and that Wells Fargo, in its sole and arbitrary discretion, has
      the present right to exercise any and all of the remedies available to
      it in Section 9 of the Pledge Agreement and as otherwise provided in
      the Pledge Agreement with respect to an Event of Default.
4.    Forbearance.

      punctually perform all of its/his obligations hereunder and under the
      Loan Documents (subject only to the defaults listed on Exhibit A), the
      Guaranty and the Pledge Agreement; (b) each representation or warranty
      of Borrowers, Guarantor and Pledgor hereunder remains true and correct
      in all respects; and (c) Leisure Life provides Wells Fargo with a
      Budget, Wells Fargo, during the period covered by the Budget, will
      forbear from exercising its remedies under the Loan Documents with
      respect to Leisure Life and will, in its sole and absolute discretion,
      advance credit to Leisure Life in the manner described in Section 5
      below.
4.2 This Agreement is not a waiver by Wells Fargo of the existing defaults or
      any future defaults and shall not prevent Wells Fargo from exercising
      its right to pursue its remedies for default, except as provided in
      Section 4.1.  Wells Fargo's failure to exercise any right, privilege or

      Guaranty, the Pledge Agreement or otherwise, (ii) be deemed to amend or
      alter any provision of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, the
      Guaranty or the Pledge Agreement or (iii) constitute a course of dealing
      or other basis for altering any of Borrowers', Guarantor's or Pledgor's
      obligations or any of Wells Fargo's rights, privileges or remedies under
      any of the Loan Documents, the Guaranty, the Pledge Agreement or
      otherwise.  Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all of the
      provisions of the Loan Documents, the Guaranty and the Pledge Agreement
      shall remain in full force and effect.
5.    Discretionary Advances of Credit.
5.1 Except for such advances as Wells Fargo in its discretion makes to
      Parent with respect to expenses related to cash management services,
      no further credit will be advanced to any Borrower under the Loan
      Documents, except advances, if any, to Leisure Life described herein.

      Leisure Life up to the amount of credit projected to be necessary at any
      time pursuant to the Budget, and all such advances shall be included in
      the Obligations.  Borrowers, Guarantor and Pledgor each acknowledge that
      any advance made by Wells Fargo shall be made by it in its sole

      of the Revolving Loans.

Dear Mr. Itin:

Agreement to permit Borrower additional time to pursue alternative financing
to pay off the Liabilities.  All capitalized terms not defined in this

described in the Loan Documents.

As of May 7, 2001, the Liabilities include:


              Loans (note amount and date)    PrincipaL       Interest

The amounts referenced above are exclusive of interest accruing after May 7,
2001, unpaid fees of $300,000, other fees, costs and expenses (including, but
 not limited to, inside and outside counsel fees).

Without limitation, Borrower in default under the Agreement and the Loan
Documents for, among other things, failure to pay principal payments and fees
when due, and failure to raise required additional equity.

Subject to Borrower's and Guarantors' timely, written acceptance of the
following conditions, Bank is willing to forbear until June 30, 2001,
subject to earlier termination as provided below, from further action
to collect the Liabilities:

1.    Borrower and Guarantors acknowledge the Liabilities as set out in
      the Agreement and the Loan Documents and the amount of the
      Liabilities as stated above.  Guarantors ratify and reaffirm their
      guaranties.

2.    Future administration of the Liabilities and the financing
      arrangements among Bank, Borrower and Guarantors shall continue to
      be governed by the covenants, terms and conditions of the Agreement
      and the Loan Documents, which are ratified and confirmed and
      incorporated by this reference, except to the extent that the
      Agreement and the Loan Documents have been superseded, amended,
      modified or supplemented by this Amendment or are inconsistent with
      this Amendment, then this Amendment shall govern.

3.    All of the Liabilities shall be paid in full on or before June 30,
      2001.

4.    Concurrently with execution and delivery of this Amendment by
      Borrower and Guarantors to Bank, Borrower and Guarantors shall cause
      The Links at Birch Run's Playpark LLC and The Learning Center at
      Birch Run's Playpark LLC to execute and deliver to Bank mortgages on
      all property owned by those entities located in Birch Run, Michigan
      (the "Birch Run Mortgages") to secure all of the Liabilities. The
      Birch Run Mortgages shall be in form and substance acceptable to
      Bank.

5.    Concurrently with execution and delivery of this Amendment,
      Thomas W. Itin and Shirley B. Itin shall execute and deliver to Bank
      an amendment to the mortgage by them to Bank pledging the real
      property commonly known as 4831 Old Orchard Trail, Orchard Village,
      Michigan, to confirm that the mortgage secures all of their
      obligations to Bank including their guaranty of the Liabilities.
      The amendment shall be in form and substance acceptable to Bank.

6.    Borrower and Guarantors acknowledge Bank remains under no obligation
      to advance funds or extend credit to Borrower pursuant to the Loan
      Documents, or otherwise.

7.    Effective as of March 1, 2001, interest on the Liabilities shall
      accrue at Bank's "prime rate" (as defined in the Loan Documents)
      plus five percentage points (5%) and shall be due and payable on the
      first (1st) day of each and every month.  Thereafter, upon the
      occurrence of a default under the terms of this Amendment or any
      further defaults under the Agreement or the Loan Documents, then the
      Liabilities shall accrue interest at the rate otherwise provided in
      this paragraph plus three percentage points (3%).

8.    Notwithstanding Bank's demand of the Liabilities, Borrower shall
      make the following principal payments to Bank: (a) $100,000 on or
      before April 30, 2001, timely receipt of which is hereby
      acknowledged by Bank; plus (b) an amount equal to 33% of the equity
      raised for ProGolf.com for the period May 1, 2001 through May 31,
      2001, to be paid as and when raised, provided, however, that Bank
      must receive not less than $100,000 by May 31, 2001; plus (c) an
      amount equal to 33% of the equity raised for ProGolf.com for the
      period June 1, 2001 through June 29, 2001, to be paid as and when
      raised, provided, however, that Bank must receive not less than
      $100,000 by June 29, 2001.

9.    Borrower and Guarantors acknowledge and agree the Agreement and the
      Loan Documents presently provide for and they shall reimburse for
      any and all costs and expenses of Bank, including, but not limited
      to, all inside and outside counsel fees of Bank whether in relation
      to drafting, negotiating or enforcement or defense of the Agreement

      disgorgement  actions as defined in this Amendment and all of Bank's
      audit fees, incurred by Bank in connection with the Liabilities,
      Bank's administration of the Liabilities and/or any efforts of Bank
      to collect or satisfy all or any part of the Liabilities.  Borrower
      and Guarantors shall immediately reimburse Bank for all of Bank's
      costs and expenses upon Bank's incurrence thereof or upon demand.

10.   Borrower is in default in payment of $300,000 of fees due Bank on
      account of loan transactions between Borrower and Bank.  Borrower
      acknowledges and agrees that the fees were earned by Bank and are
      due and owing without setoff or defense.

11.   Borrower and Guarantors acknowledge that Signature Sports &
      Entertainment, Inc. ("SSE") is a mortgagor under a mortgage to Bank
      of Florida real property to secure the Liabilities, that SSE signed
      the Agreement, that the signature of SSE to this Amendment is not a
      requirement of any of them, and that this Amendment shall be binding
      upon each of them in accordance with its terms notwithstanding that
      SSE is not signing this Amendment.

12.   This Amendment shall be governed and controlled in all respects by
      the laws of the State of Michigan, without reference to its
      conflict of law provisions, including interpretation,
      enforceability, validity and construction.

13.   Bank expressly reserves the right to exercise any or all rights and
      remedies provided under the Agreement and the Loan Documents and
      applicable law except as modified herein.  Bank's failure to
      immediately exercise such rights and remedies shall not be construed
      as a waiver or modification of those rights or an offer of
      forbearance.

14.   This Amendment will inure to the benefit of Bank and all its past,
      present and future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors
      and successor corporations and all of their subsidiaries and
      affiliates.

15.   Bank anticipates that discussions addressing the Liabilities may
      take place in the future.  During the course of such discussions,
      Bank, Borrower and Guarantors, may touch upon and possibly reach a
      preliminary understanding on one or more issues prior to concluding
      negotiations.  Notwithstanding this fact and absent an express
      written waiver by Bank, Bank will not be bound by an agreement on
      any individual issues unless and until an agreement is reached on
      all issues and such agreement is reduced to writing and signed by
      Borrower, Guarantors and Bank.

16.   As of the date of this Amendment, there are no offers outstanding
      from Bank to Borrower and Guarantors.  Any prior offer by Bank,
      whether oral or written is hereby rescinded in full.  There are no
      oral agreements between Bank and Borrower and Guarantor; any
      agreements concerning the Liabilities are expressed only in the
      existing Loan Documents.  The duties and obligations of Borrower and
      Guarantor and Bank shall be only as set forth in the Agreement, Loan
      Documents and this Amendment when executed by all parties.

17.   BORROWER, GUARANTORS AND BANK ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE RIGHT
      TO TRIAL BY JURY IS A CONSTITUTIONAL ONE, BUT THAT IT MAY BE WAIVED.
      EACH PARTY, AFTER CONSULTING (OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO
      CONSULT) WITH COUNSEL OF THEIR CHOICE, KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY,
      AND FOR THEIR MUTUAL BENEFIT WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
      THE EVENT OF LITIGATION REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF,
      OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO, THIS AMENDMENT, THE AGREEMENT, THE LOAN
      DOCUMENTS OR THE LIABILITIES.

      ATTORNEYS, STOCKHOLDERS AND SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, FROM AND OF ANY

      THROUGH AND INCLUDING THE DATE OF THIS AMENDMENT, WHETHER KNOWN OR
      UNKNOWN, AGAINST ANY OR ALL OF BANK, BANK'S EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS,
      DIRECTORS, ATTORNEYS, STOCKHOLDERS AND SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

19.   The parties submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the circuit
      court for the County of Oakland, State of Michigan or, if original
      jurisdiction can be established, the United District Court for the
      Eastern District of Michigan with respect to any action arising,
      directly or indirectly, out of this Amendment or the performance or
      breach of this Amendment.  The parties stipulate that the venues
      referenced in this Amendment are convenient.

20.   This Amendment may be executed in counterparts and facsimiles and
      the counterpart, when properly executed and delivered by the signing
      deadline, will constitute a fully executed complete agreement.

21.   Borrower and Guarantors shall properly execute this Amendment and
      deliver it to the undersigned by no later than 5:00 p.m. on May 10,
      2001.

      had the opportunity to review) this Amendment with counsel of their
      choice and have executed this Amendment voluntarily and without
      coercion or duress.

financial condition of Borrower or Guarantors, or any of them, or further

      units of stock for which the Participant is not obligated to pay
      additional consideration.
   q. "Ten Percent Holder" - A person who owns (or is deemed to own, pursuant
      to Section 424(d) of the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent
      (10%) of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of
      stock of the Company.
3. Administration. The Plan shall be administered by the Board, provided
however, that the Board may delegate such administration to the Committee.
Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board and/or the Committee
shall have authority to (a) grant, in its discretion, Incentive Stock
Options in accordance with Section 422 of the Code, or Nonstatutory
Options, Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers; (b) determine
in good faith the Fair Market Value of the Stock covered by any Grant; (c)
determine which eligible persons shall receive Grants and the number of
shares, restrictions, terms and conditions to be included in such Grants;
(d) construe and interpret the Plan; (e) promulgate, amend and rescind
rules and regulations relating to its administration, and correct defects,
omissions and inconsistencies in the Plan or any Grant; (f) consistent
with the Plan and with the consent of the Participant, as appropriate,
amend any outstanding Grant or amend the exercise date or dates thereof;
(g) determine the duration and purpose of leaves of absence which may be
granted to Participants without constituting termination of their
employment for the purpose of the Plan or any Grant; and (h) make all
other determinations necessary or advisable for the Plan's administration.
The interpretation and construction by the Board of any provisions of the
Plan or selection of Participants shall be conclusive and final. No member
of the Board or the Committee shall be liable for any action or
determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Grant
made thereunder.

4. Eligibility.
   a. General:  The persons who shall be eligible to receive Grants shall be
      directors, officers, employees and consultants to the Company. The
      term consultant shall mean any person, other than an employee, who is
      engaged by the Company to render services and is compensated for such
      services. An Optionee may hold more than one Option. Any issuance of a
      Grant to an officer or director of the Company subsequent to the first
      registration of any of the securities of the Company under the Exchange
      Act shall comply with Rule 16b-3 and the Participant officer or
      director shall comply with the beneficial ownership reporting
      requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

   b. Incentive Stock Options:  Incentive Stock Options may only be issued to
      employees of the Company. Incentive Stock Options may be granted to
      officers or directors, provided they are also employees of the Company.
      Payment of a director's fee shall not be sufficient to constitute
      employment by the Company.

      The Company shall not grant an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan to
      any employee if such Grant would result in such employee holding the
      right to exercise for the first time in any one calendar year, under
      all Incentive Stock Options granted to such employee under the Plan or
      any other plan maintained by the Company, options to purchase shares of
      Stock having an aggregate fair market value in excess of $100,000,
      determined as of the date of the Option is granted. Should it be
      determined that an Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan
      exceeds this maximum for any reason other than a failure in good faith
      to value the Stock subject to such Option, the excess portion of such
      Option shall be considered a Nonstatutory Option. To the extent the
      employee holds two (2) or more such Options that become exercisable for
      the first time in the same calendar year, the foregoing limitation on
      the exercisability of such Options as Incentive Stock Options under the
      Federal tax laws shall be applied on the basis of the order in which
      such Options are granted. If, for any reason, an entire Option does not
      qualify as an Incentive Stock Option by reason of exceeding such
      maximum, such Option shall be considered a Nonstatutory Option.

   c. Nonstatutory Option:  The provisions of the foregoing Section 4(b)
      shall not apply to any Option designated as a "Nonstatutory Option" or
      which sets forth the intention of the parties that the Option be a
      Nonstatutory Option.

   d. Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Purchase Offers:  The provisions of
      this Section 4 shall not apply to any Stock Award or Restricted Stock
      Purchase Offer under the Plan.

5. Stock.
   a. Authorized Stock.  Stock subject to Grants may be either previously
      unissued or reacquired Stock

   b. Number of Shares.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6(i) of
      the Plan, the total number of shares of Stock which may be purchased or
      granted directly by Options, Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase
      Offers, or purchased indirectly through exercise of Options granted
      under the Plan shall not exceed 3,750,000 shares of Stock (after giving
      effect to the 2-for-1 stock split approved by the Company's Board on
      August 10, 1999 and the Company's Stockholders on Janaury 21, 2000).If
      any Grant shall for any reason terminate or expire, any shares
      allocated thereto but remaining unpurchased upon such expiration or
      termination shall again be available for Grants with respect thereto
      under the Plan as though no Grant had previously occurred with respect
      to such shares. Any shares of Stock issued pursuant to a Grant and
      repurchased pursuant to the terms thereof shall be available for future
      Grants as though not previously covered by a Grant.

   c. Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall reserve and keep available at
      all times during the term of the Plan such number of shares as shall be
      sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. If, after
      reasonable efforts, which efforts shall not include the registration of
      the Plan or Grants under the Securities Act, the Company is unable to
      obtain authority from any applicable regulatory body, which
      authorization is deemed necessary by legal counsel for the Company for
      the lawful issuance of shares hereunder, the Company shall be relieved
      of any liability with respect to its failure to issue and sell the
      shares for which such requisite authority was so deemed necessary
      unless and until such authority is obtained.

   d. Application of Funds.  The proceeds received by the Company from the
      sale of Stock pursuant to the exercise of Options or rights under Grant
      agreements for Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers will be
      used for general corporate purposes.

   e. No Obligation to Exercise.  The issuance of a Grant shall impose no
      obligation upon the Participant to exercise any rights under such
      Grant.

6. Terms and Conditions of Options. Options granted hereunder shall be
evidenced by agreements between the Company and the respective Optionees,
in such form and substance as the Board or Committee shall from time to
time approve. Option agreements need not be identical, and in each case
may include such provisions as the Board or Committee may determine, but
all such agreements shall be subject to and limited by the following terms
and conditions:

   a. Number of Shares: Each Option shall state the number of shares to which
      it pertains.

   b. Exercise Price: Each Option shall state the exercise price, which shall
      be determined as follows:

      i. Any Incentive Stock Option granted to Ten Percent Holder shall have
         an exercise price of no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of
         the Stock as of the date of grant; and
     ii. Incentive Stock Options granted to a person who at the time the
         Option is granted is not a Ten Percent Holder shall have an exercise
         price of no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock as
         of the date of grant.
    iii. Nonstatutory Stock Options granted under this Plan shall have an
         exercise price not less than 85% of the Fair Market Value of the
         Stock as of the date of grant.

   c. Medium and Time of Payment:  The exercise price shall become
      immediately due upon exercise of the Option and shall be paid in cash
      or check made payable to the Company. Should the Company's outstanding
      Stock be registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act at the time
      the Option is exercised, then the exercise price may also be paid as
      follows:

      i. in shares of Stock held by the Optionee for the requisite period
         necessary to avoid a charge to the Company's earnings for financial
         reporting purposes and valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise
         date, or
     ii. through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which
         the Optionee shall concurrently provide irrevocable written
         instructions (x) to a Company designated brokerage firm to effect
         the immediate sale of the purchased shares and remit to the Company,
         out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date,
         sufficient funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for
         the purchased shares plus all applicable Federal, state and local
         income and employment taxes required to be withheld by the Company
         by reason of such purchase and (y) to the Company to deliver the
         certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage
         firm in order to complete the sale transaction.

    iii. At the discretion of the Board, exercisable either at the time of
         Option grant or of Option exercise, the exercise price may also be
         paid (x) by Optionee's delivery of a promissory note in form and
         substance satisfactory to the Company and permissible under
         applicable securities laws and regulations and the DGCL, bearing
         interest at a rate determined by the Board in its sole discretion,
         but in no event less than the minimum rate of interest required to
         avoid the imputation of compensation income to the Optionee under
         the Code and any applicable regulations promulgated thereunder, or
     (y) in such other form of consideration permitted by the DGCL as may
         be acceptable to the Board.

   d. Term and Exercise of Options:  Any Option granted to an employee of the
      Company shall become exercisable over a period of no longer than five
      (5) years, and no less than twenty percent (20%) of the shares covered
      thereby shall become exercisable annually. In no event shall any Option
      be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it
      is granted, and no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent
      Holder shall, by its terms, be exercisable after the expiration of five
      (5) years from the date of the Option. Unless a later date of grant is
      specified by the Board or the Committee in the resolution authorizing
      such Option, the date of grant of an Option shall be deemed to be the
      date upon which the Board or the Committee authorizes the granting of
      such Option.

      Each Option shall be exercisable to the nearest whole share, in
      installments or otherwise, as the respective Option agreements may
      provide. During the lifetime of an Optionee, the Option shall be
      exercisable only by the Optionee and shall not be assignable or
      transferable by the Optionee, and no other person shall acquire any
      rights therein. To the extent not exercised, installments (if more than
      one) shall accumulate, but shall be exercisable, in whole or in part,
      only during the period for exercise as stated in the Option agreement,
      whether or not other installments are then exercisable.

   e. Termination of Status as Employee, Consultant or Director:  If
      Optionee's status as an employee shall terminate for any reason other
      than Optionee's disability or death, then Optionee (or if the Optionee
      shall die after such termination, but prior to exercise, Optionee's
      personal representative or the person entitled to succeed to the
      Option) shall have the right to exercise the portions of any of
      Optionee's Incentive Stock Options which were exercisable as of the
      date of such termination, in whole or in part, not less than 30 days
      nor more than three (3) months after such termination; provided, that
      if termination was "for cause" as that term is defined in applicable
      labor laws and case law related thereto, or by the terms of the Plan or
      the Option Agreement or an employment agreement, the Option shall
      automatically terminate as of the termination of employment as to all
      shares covered by the Option.

      With respect to Nonstatutory Options granted to employees, directors or
      consultants, the Board may specify such period for exercise, not less
      than 30 days (except that in the case of "termination for cause" or
      removal of a director, the Option shall automatically terminate as of
      the termination of employment or services) following termination of
      employment or services as the Board deems reasonable and appropriate.
      The Option may be exercised only with respect to installments that the
      Optionee could have exercised at the date of termination of employment
      or services. Nothing contained herein or in any Option granted pursuant
      hereto shall be construed to affect or restrict in any way the right of
      the Company to terminate the employment or services of an Optionee with
      or without cause.

   f. Disability of Optionee:  If an Optionee is disabled (within the meaning
      of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) at the time of termination, the three
      (3) month period set forth in Section 6(e) shall be a period, as
      determined by the Board and set forth in the Option agreement, of not
      less than six (6) months nor more than one (1) year after such
      termination.

   g. Death of Optionee:  If an Optionee dies while employed by, engaged as a
      consultant to, or serving as a director of the Company, the portion of
      such Optionee's Option which was exercisable at the date of death may
      be exercised, in whole or in part, by the estate of the deceased
      Optionee or by a person succeeding to the right to exercise such Option
      at any time within (i) a period, as determined by the Board and set
      forth in the Option, of not less than six (6) months nor more than one
      (1) year after Optionee's death, which period shall not be more, in the
      case of a Nonstatutory Option, than the period for exercise following
      termination of employment or services, or (ii) the remaining term of
      the Option, whichever is the lesser. The Option may be so exercised
      only with respect to installments exercisable at the time of Optionee's
      death and not previously exercised by the Optionee.

   h. Nontransferability of Option:  No Option shall be transferable by the
      Optionee, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution

   i. Recapitalization:  Subject to any required action of shareholders, the
      number of shares of Stock covered by each outstanding Option, and the
      exercise price per share thereof set forth in each such Option, shall
      be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number
      of issued shares of Stock of the Company resulting from a stock split,
      stock dividend, combination, subdivision or reclassification of shares,
      or the payment of a stock dividend, or any other increase or decrease
      in the number of such shares affected without receipt of consideration
      by the Company; provided, however, the conversion of any convertible
      securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected
      without receipt of consideration" by the Company.

      In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, a
      merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving
      entity, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets or capital
      stock of the Company (collectively, a "Reorganization"), unless
      otherwise provided by the Board (either by resolution or in the Option
      agreement), outstanding Options shall terminate immediately prior to a
      date set by the Board, which date shall be no later than the
      consummation of such Reorganization. In such event, if the entity which
      shall be the surviving entity does not tender to Optionee an offer, for
      which it has no obligation to do so, to substitute for any unexercised
      Option a stock option or capital stock of such surviving entity, as
      applicable, which on an equitable basis shall provide the Optionee with
      substantially the same economic benefit as such unexercised Option,
      then the Board may grant to such Optionee, in its sole and absolute
      discretion and without obligation, the right for a period commencing
      thirty (30) days prior to and ending immediately prior to the date
      determined by the Board pursuant hereto for termination of the Option
      or during the remaining term of the Option, whichever is the lesser, to
      exercise any unexpired Option or Options without regard to the
      installment provisions of Paragraph 6(d) of the Plan; provided, that
      any such right granted shall be granted to all Optionees not receiving
      an offer to receive substitute options on a consistent basis, and
      provided further, that any such exercise shall be subject to the
      consummation of such Reorganization.

      Subject to any required action of shareholders, if the Company shall be
      the surviving entity in any merger or consolidation, each outstanding
      Option thereafter shall pertain to and apply to the securities to which
      a holder of shares of Stock equal to the shares subject to the Option
      would have been entitled by reason of such merger or consolidation
      In the event of a change in the Stock of the Company as presently
      constituted, which is limited to a change of all of its authorized
      shares without par value into the same number of shares with a par
      value, the shares resulting from any such change shall be deemed to be
      the Stock within the meaning of the Plan.

      To the extent that the foregoing adjustments relate to stock or
      securities of the Company, such adjustments shall be made by the Board,
      whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and
      conclusive. Except as expressly provided in this Section 6(i), the
      Optionee shall have no rights by reason of any subdivision or
      consolidation of shares of stock of any class or the payment of any
      stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of
      shares of stock of any class, and the number or price of shares of
      Stock subject to any Option shall not be affected by, and no adjustment
      shall be made by reason of, any dissolution, liquidation, merger,
      consolidation or sale of assets or capital stock, or any issue by the
      Company of shares of stock of any class or securities convertible into
      shares of stock of any class.

      The Grant of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way
      the right or power of the Company to make any adjustments,
      reclassifications, reorganizations or changes in its capital or
      business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, or liquidate or
      to sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets

   j. No Rights as a Shareholder:  An Optionee shall have no rights as a
      shareholder with respect to any shares covered by an Option until the
      effective date of the issuance of the shares following exercise of such
      Option by Optionee. No adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary
      or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities or other property) or
      distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the
      date such stock certificate is issued, except as expressly provided in
      Section 6(i) hereof.

   k. Modification, Acceleration, Extension, and Renewal of Options:  Subject
      to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of the Plan, the
      Board may modify an Option, or, once an Option is exercisable,
      accelerate the rate at which it may be exercised, and may extend or
      renew outstanding Options granted under the Plan or accept the
      surrender of outstanding Options (to the extent not theretofore
      exercised) and authorize the granting of new Options in substitution
      for such Options, provided such action is permissible under Section 422
      of the Code and applicable federal and state securities laws and
      regulations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(k),
      however, no modification of an Option shall, without the consent of the
      Optionee, alter to the Optionee's detriment or impair any rights or
      obligations under any Option theretofore granted under the Plan.

   l. Exercise Before Exercise Date:  At the discretion of the Board, the
      Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the Optionee may
      elect to exercise all or any portion of the Option prior to the stated
      exercise date of the Option or any installment thereof becomes vested.
      Any shares so purchased prior to the stated exercise date shall be
      subject to repurchase by the Company upon termination of Optionee's
      employment as contemplated by Section 6(n) hereof prior to the exercise
      date stated in the Option and such other restrictions and conditions as
      the Board or Committee may deem advisable.

   m. Other Provisions:  The Option agreements evidencing Options granted
      under the Plan shall contain such other provisions, including, without
      limitation, restrictions upon the exercise of the Options, as the Board
      or the Committee shall deem advisable. Shares shall not be issued
      pursuant to the exercise of an Option, if the exercise of such Option
      or the issuance of shares thereunder would violate, in the opinion of
      legal counsel for the Company, the provisions of any applicable law or
      the rules or regulations of any applicable governmental or
      administrative agency or body, such as the Code, the Securities Act,
      the Exchange Act, the DGCL, any applicable state securities rules, and
      the rules promulgated under the foregoing or the rules and regulations
      of any exchange upon which the shares of the Company are listed.
      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the exercise of each
      Option shall be subject to the condition that if at any time the
      Company shall determine that (i) the satisfaction of withholding tax or
      other similar liabilities, or (ii) the listing, registration, or
      qualification of any shares covered by such exercise upon any
      securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or (iii) the
      consent or approval of any regulatory body, or (iv) the perfection of
      any exemption from any such withholding, listing, registration,
      qualification, consent or approval is necessary or desirable in
      connection with such exercise or the issuance of shares thereunder,
      then in any such event, such exercise shall not be effective unless
      such withholding, listing registration, qualification, consent,
      approval or exemption shall have been effected, obtained or perfected
      free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company.

   n. Repurchase Agreement:  The Board may, in its discretion, require as a
      condition to the Grant of an Option hereunder, that an Optionee execute
      an agreement with the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to
      the Board in its discretion ("Repurchase Agreement"), (i) restricting
      the Optionee's right to transfer shares purchased under such Option
      without first offering such shares to the Company or another
      shareholder of the Company upon the same terms and conditions as
      provided therein; and (ii) providing that upon termination of
      Optionee's employment with the Company, for any reason, the Company (or
      another shareholder of the Company, as provided in the Repurchase
      Agreement) shall have the right at the Company's discretion (or the
      discretion of such other shareholders) to purchase and/or redeem all
      such shares owned by the Optionee on the date of termination of his or
      her employment at a price equal to (A) the fair value of such shares as
      of such date of termination, or (B) if such repurchase right lapses at
      20% of the number of shares per year, the original purchase price of
      such shares, and upon terms of payment permissible under applicable
      federal and state securities rules; provided that in the case of
      Options or Stock Awards granted to officers, directors, consultants or
      affiliates of the Company, such repurchase provisions may be subject to
      additional or greater restrictions as determined by the Board or
      Committee.

7.  Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Purchase Offers.
    a. Types of Grants.
       i. Stock Award.  All or part of any Stock Award under the Plan may be
          subject to conditions established by the Board or the Committee,
          and set forth in the Stock Award Agreement, which may include,
          but are not limited to, continuous service with the Company,
          achievement of specific business objectives, increases in
          specified indices, attaining growth rates and other comparable
          measurements of Company performance. Stock Awards may be based
          on Fair Market Value or other specified valuation. All Stock
          Awards will be made pursuant to the execution of a Stock Award
          Agreement containing terms and provisions consistent with this
          Plan and in form and substance as approved by the Board from
          time to time.

      ii. Restricted Stock Purchase Offer.  A Grant of a Restricted Stock
          Purchase Offer under the Plan shall be subject to such (i) vesting
          contingencies related to the Participant's continued association
          with the Company for a specified time and (ii) other specified
          conditions as the Board or Committee shall determine, in its sole
          discretion, consistent with the provisions of the Plan. All
          Restricted Stock Purchase Offers shall be made pursuant to a
          Restricted Stock Purchase Offer containing terms and provisions
          consistent with this Plan and in form and substance as approved by
          the Board from time to time.

   b. Conditions and Restrictions.  Shares of Stock which Participants may
      receive as a Stock Award under a Stock Award Agreement or Restricted
      Stock Purchase Offer under a Restricted Stock Purchase Offer may
      include such restrictions as the Board or Committee, as applicable,
      shall determine, including restrictions on transfer, repurchase rights,
      right of first refusal, and forfeiture provisions. When transfer of
      Stock is so restricted or subject to forfeiture provisions it is
      referred to as "Restricted Stock." Further, with Board or Committee
      approval, Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers may be
      deferred, either in the form of installments or a future lump sum
      distribution. The Board or Committee may permit selected Participants
      to elect to defer distributions of Stock Awards or Restricted Stock
      Purchase Offers in accordance with procedures established by the Board
      or Committee to assure that such deferrals comply with applicable
      requirements of the Code including, at the choice of Participants, the
      capability to make further deferrals for distribution after retirement.

      Any deferred distribution, whether elected by the Participant or
      specified by the Stock Award Agreement, Restricted Stock Purchase
      Offers or by the Board or Committee, may require the payment to be
      forfeited in accordance with the provisions of Section 7(c). Dividends
      or dividend equivalent rights may be extended to and made part of any
      Stock Award or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers denominated in Stock or
      units of Stock, subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as
      the Board or Committee may establish.

   c. Cancellation and Rescission of Grants.  Unless the Stock Award
      Agreement or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer specifies otherwise, the
      Board or Committee, as applicable, may cancel any unexpired, unpaid, or
      deferred Grants at any time if the Participant is not in compliance
      with all other applicable provisions of the Stock Award Agreement or
      Restricted Stock Purchase Offer, the Plan and with the following
      conditions:

      i. A Participant shall not render services for any organization or
         engage directly or indirectly in any business which, in the judgment
         of the chief executive officer of the Company or other senior
         officer designated by the Board or Committee, is or becomes
         competitive with the Company, or which organization or business, or
         the rendering of services to such organization or business, is or
         becomes otherwise prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests
         of the Company. For Participants whose employment has terminated,
         the judgment of the chief executive officer shall be based on the
         Participant's position and responsibilities while employed by the
         Company, the Participant's post-employment responsibilities and
         position with the other organization or business, the extent of
         past, current and potential competition or conflict between the
         Company and the other organization or business, the effect on the
         Company's customers, suppliers and competitors and such other
         considerations as are deemed relevant given the applicable facts and
         circumstances. A Participant who has retired shall be free, however,
         to purchase as an investment or otherwise, stock or other securities
         of such organization or business so long as they are listed upon a
         recognized securities exchange or traded over-the-counter, and such
         investment does not represent a substantial investment to the
         Participant or a greater than a ten percent (10%) equity interest in
         the organization or business.

     ii. A Participant shall not, without prior written authorization from
         the Company, disclose to anyone outside the Company, or use in other
         than the Company's business, any confidential information or
         material, as defined by the Company from time to time in its form of
         confidentiality agreement or similar agreement regarding
         confidential information and intellectual property, relating to the
         business of the Company, acquired by the Participant either during
         or after employment with the Company.

    iii. A Participant, if so required under a written employment or other
         agreement, shall disclose promptly and assign to the Company all
         right, title and interest in any invention or idea, patentable or
         not, made or conceived by the Participant during employment by the
         Company, relating in any manner to the actual or anticipated
         business, research or development work of the Company and shall do
         anything reasonably necessary to enable the Company to secure a
         patent where appropriate in the United States and in foreign
         countries.

     iv. Upon exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to a Grant, the
         Participant shall certify on a form acceptable to the Committee that
         he or she is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the
         Plan. Failure to comply with all of the provisions of this Section
         7(c) prior to, or during the six months after, any exercise, payment
         or delivery pursuant to a Grant shall cause such exercise, payment
         or delivery to be rescinded. The Company shall notify the
         Participant in writing of any such rescission within two years after
         such exercise, payment or delivery. Within ten days after receiving
         such a notice from the Company, the Participant shall pay to the
         Company the amount of any gain realized or payment received as a
         result of the rescinded exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to a
         Grant. Such payment shall be made either in cash or by returning to
         the Company the number of shares of Stock that the Participant
         received in connection with the rescinded exercise, payment or
         delivery.

   d. Nonassignability.
      i. Except pursuant to Section 7(e)(iii) and except as set forth in
         Section 7(d)(ii), no Grant or any other benefit under the Plan shall
         be assignable or transferable, or payable to or exercisable by,
         anyone other than the Participant to whom it was granted.
     ii. Where a Participant terminates employment and retains a Grant
         pursuant to Section 7(e)(ii) in order to assume a position with a
         governmental, charitable or educational institution, the Board or
         Committee, in its discretion and to the extent permitted by law, may
         authorize a third party (including but not limited to the trustee of
         a "blind" trust), acceptable to the applicable governmental or
         institutional authorities, the Participant and the Board or
         Committee, to act on behalf of the Participant with regard to such
         Awards.

   e. Termination of Employment.  If the employment or service to the Company
      of a Participant terminates, other than pursuant to any of the
      following provisions under this Section 7(e), all unexercised, deferred
      and unpaid Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers shall be
      cancelled immediately, unless the Stock Award Agreement or Restricted
      Stock Purchase Offer provides otherwise:

      i. Retirement Under a Company Retirement Plan.  When a Participant's
         employment terminates as a result of retirement in accordance with
         the terms of a Company retirement plan, the Board or Committee may
         permit Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers to continue
         in effect beyond the date of retirement in accordance with the
         applicable Grant Agreement and the exercisability and vesting of any
         such Grants may be accelerated.

     ii. Rights in the Best Interests of the Company.  When a Participant
         resigns from the Company and, in the judgment of the Board or
         Committee, the acceleration and/or continuation of outstanding Stock
         Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers would be in the best
         interests of the Company, the Board or Committee may (x) authorize,
         where appropriate, the acceleration and/or continuation of all or
         any part of Grants issued prior to such termination and (y) permit
         the exercise, vesting and payment of such Grants for such period as
         may be set forth in the applicable Grant agreement, subject to
         earlier cancellation pursuant to Section 7(c) or at such time as the
         Board or Committee shall deem the continuation of all or any part of
         the Participant's Grants are not in the Company's best interest.

    iii. Death or Disability of a Participant.
         1) In the event of a Participant's death, the Participant's estate
            or beneficiaries shall have a period up to the expiration date
            specified in the Grant Agreement within which to receive or
            exercise any outstanding Grant held by the Participant under such
            terms as may be specified in the applicable Grant Agreement.
            Rights to any such outstanding Grants shall pass by will or the
            laws of descent and distribution in the following order: (a) to
            beneficiaries so designated by the Participant; if none, then (b)
            to a legal representative of the Participant; if none, then (c)
            to the persons entitled thereto as determined by a court having
            jurisdiction. Grants so passing shall be made at such times and
            in such manner as if the Participant were living.

         2) If a Participant is deemed by the Board or Committee to be unable
            to perform his or her usual duties by reason of mental disorder
            or medical condition which does not result from facts which would
            be grounds for termination for cause, Grants and rights to any
            such Grants may be paid to or exercised by the Participant, if
            legally competent, or a legally designated guardian or
            representative if the Participant is legally incompetent by
            virtue of such disability.

         3) After the death or disability of a Participant, the Board or
            Committee may in its sole discretion at any time (a) terminate
            restrictions in Grant Agreements; (b) accelerate any or all
            installments and rights; and (c) instruct the Company to pay the
            total of any accelerated payments in a lump sum to the
            Participant, the Participant's estate, beneficiaries or
            representative -- notwithstanding that, in the absence of such
            termination of restrictions or acceleration of payments, any or
            all of the payments due under the Grant might ultimately have
            become payable to other beneficiaries.

         4) In the event of uncertainty as to interpretation of or
            controversies concerning this Section 7, the determinations of
            the Board or Committee, as applicable, shall be binding and
            conclusive.

8. Investment Intent.  All Grants under the Plan are intended to be exempt
from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 701
thereunder. Unless and until the granting of Options or sale and issuance
of Stock subject to the Plan are registered under the Securities Act or
shall be exempt from the registration requirements contained therein and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each Grant under the
Plan shall provide that the purchases or other acquisitions of Stock
thereunder shall be for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Further, unless the
issuance and sale of the Stock have been registered under the Securities
Act, each Grant shall provide that no shares shall be purchased upon the
exercise of the rights under such Grant unless and until (a) all then
applicable requirements of state and federal laws and regulatory agencies
shall have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and
its counsel, and (b) if requested to do so by the Company, the person
exercising the rights under the Grant shall (i) give written assurances as
to knowledge and experience of such person (or a representative employed
by such person) in financial and business matters and the ability of such
person (or representative) to evaluate the merits and risks of exercising
the Option, and (ii) execute and deliver to the Company a letter of
investment intent and/or such other form related to applicable exemptions
from registration, all in such form and substance as the Company may
require.

9. Amendment, Modification, Suspension or Discontinuance of the Plan.  The
Board may, insofar as permitted by law, from time to time, with respect to
any shares at the time not subject to outstanding Grants, suspend or
terminate the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect whatsoever, except
that without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, no such
revision or amendment shall (i) increase the number of shares subject to
the Plan, (ii) decrease the price at which Grants may be granted, (iii)
materially increase the benefits to Participants, or (iv) change the class
of persons eligible to receive Grants under the Plan; provided, however,
no such action shall alter or impair the rights and obligations under any
Option, or Stock Award, or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer outstanding as
of the date thereof without the written consent of the affected
Participant(s). No Grant may be issued while the Plan is suspended or
after it is terminated, but the rights and obligations under any Grant
issued while the Plan is in effect shall not be impaired by suspension or
termination of the Plan.

In the event of any change in the outstanding Stock by reason of a stock

split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of shares,
recapitalization, merger, or similar event, the Board or the Committee may
adjust proportionally (a) the number of shares of Stock (i) reserved under
the Plan, (ii) available for Incentive Stock Options and Nonstatutory
Options and (iii) covered by outstanding Stock Awards or Restricted Stock
Purchase Offers; (b) the Stock prices related to outstanding Grants; and
(c) the appropriate Fair Market Value and other price determinations for
such Grants. In the event of any other change affecting the Stock or any
distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to holders of Stock, such
adjustments as may be deemed equitable by the Board or the Committee,
including adjustments to avoid fractional shares, shall be made to give
proper effect to such event. In the event of a corporate merger,
consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation,
reorganization or liquidation, the Board or the Committee shall be
authorized to issue or assume stock options, whether or not in a
transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, and other Grants
by means of substitution of new Grant Agreements for previously issued
Grants or an assumption of previously issued Grants.

10. Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the right to deduct applicable
taxes from any Grant payment and withhold, at the time of delivery or
exercise of Options, Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers or
vesting of shares under such Grants, an appropriate number of shares for
payment of taxes required by law or to take such other action as may be
necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for
withholding of such taxes. If Stock is used to satisfy tax withholding,
such stock shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value when the tax
withholding is required to be made.

11. Availability of Information. During the term of the Plan and any
additional period during which a Grant granted pursuant to the Plan shall
be exercisable, the Company shall make available, not later than one
hundred and twenty (120) days following the close of each of its fiscal
years, such financial and other information regarding the Company as is
required by the bylaws of the Company and applicable law to be furnished
in an annual report to the shareholders of the Company.

12. Notices. Any written notice to the Company required by any of the
provisions of the Plan shall be addressed to the chief financial officer
or to the chief executive officer of the Company, and shall become
effective when it is received by the office of the chief financial officer
or the chief executive officer.

13. Indemnification of Board. In addition to such other rights or
indemnifications as they may have as directors or otherwise, and to the
extent allowed by applicable law, the members of the Board and the
Committee shall be indemnified by the Company against the reasonable
expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and necessarily incurred in
connection with the defense of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, or
in connection with any appeal thereof, to which they or any of them may be
a party by reason of any action taken, or failure to act, under or in
connection with the Plan or any Grant granted thereunder, and against all
amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is
approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by
them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding, except in any case in relation to matters as to which it shall
be adjudged in such claim, action, suit or proceeding that such Board or
Committee member is liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance
of his or her duties; provided that within sixty (60) days after
institution of any such action, suit or Board proceeding the member
involved shall offer the Company, in writing, the opportunity, at its own
expense, to handle and defend the same.

14. Effective and Termination Dates. The Plan shall become effective on the
date it is approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of Stock
then outstanding. The Plan shall terminate ten years later, subject to
earlier termination by the Board pursuant to Section 9.

15.  Governing Law.  The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken
pursuant hereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code, the
securities laws of the United States or the DGCL, shall be governed by the
law of the State of Michigan and construed in accordance therewith.

	The foregoing 2000 Incentive Stock Plan was duly adopted and approved
by separate written consents of the Board of Directors and the stockholders
of the Company effective on January 28, 2000.
