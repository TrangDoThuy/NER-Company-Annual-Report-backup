<P align=justify><B>Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings </B></P>
<P align=justify>During the past five years, none of our officers, directors,
promoters or control persons have had any of the following events occur: </P>
<UL style=""TEXT-ALIGN: justify"">
  <LI>a bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such
  person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
  bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;
  <LI>conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal
  proceeding, excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses;
  <LI>being subject to any order, judgement or decree, not substantially

  <LI>being found by a court of competent jurisdiction, in a civil action, the
  SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or

  suspended or vacated. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify><B>Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934</B> </P>
<P align=justify>Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive
officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock to
file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes
in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common stock
and other equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive
officers, directors &amp; greater than 10% shareholders are required by the SEC
regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they
file. </P>
<P align=justify>Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received
by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe
that during fiscal year ended May 31, 2013, all filing requirements applicable
to our officers, directors and greater than 10% percent beneficial owners were
complied with , with the exception of the following: </P>

<P align=justify><B>Code of Ethics </B></P>
<P align=justify>Our board of directors on April 22, 2008, adopted a formal
written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Compliance Program for all
officers, directors and senior employees. Our Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics Program was filed as an exhibit to our Form S-1 filed with the SEC on
September 05, 2008. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert
</B></P>
<P align=justify>Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a
member of its audit committee that qualifies as an &#145;audit committee financial
expert&#148; as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is &#147;independent&#148;
as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act.
</P>
<P align=justify>We believe that the members of our board of directors are
collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and
understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We
believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an &#147;audit
committee financial expert&#148; would be overly costly and burdensome and is not
warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the
fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we
currently do not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees
performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation or
audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is
necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such
committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors. </P>
