On October 15, 2010 we changed our name to All American Gold Corp. and effected an 10:1 forward split of our common stock. Our statutory registered agent's office is located at 1620 Central Avenue, Suite 202, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82001 and our business office is located at 514 Enfield Road, Delray Beach, FL 33440-2840. Our telephone number is (888) 755-9766 and our e-mail addresses are info@allamericangoldcorp.com or allamericangold@gmail.com.There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation. We are a start-up, exploration stage company engaged in the search for gold and related minerals. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit, a reserve, exists in our mineral properties or can be shown to exist until sufficient and appropriate exploration is done and a comprehensive evaluation of such work concludes economic and legal feasibility."

(&#147;TAC&#148;), a Canadian reporting issuer which trades on the Canadian National Stock Exchange (CNSX), in regards to the acquisition of certain property interests. The interests that we acquired were as follows: A 70% interest in a mineral exploration property called the &#147;Belleville&#148; property in Mineral County, Nevada subject to our making certain payments, share issuances and exploration expenditures through 2016. TAC has an underlying option agreement with Minquest Inc. for the acquisition of a 100% interest in the property (under which agreement Minquest has retained a 3% net smelter return royalty); the option on the property was terminated on September 11, 2012, as the result of poor results and overburden issues; A 35% interest in a mineral exploration property called the &#147;Goldfield West&#148; property in Esmeralda County, Nevada subject to our making certain payments, share issuances and exploration expenditures through 2017. TAC has an underlying option agreement with Minquest Inc. for the acquisition of a 100% interest in the property; the option on the property was terminated on May 31, 2013, because of inadequate results and TAC&#146;s election not to move forward on the project."

Incurring exploration expenditures in the aggregate amount of $1,320,000 in annual amounts ranging from $120,000 to $400,000, to the seventh anniversary of the underlying option agreement.In addition, TAC was required to make certain share issuances to Minquest under the terms of the option agreements between them (700,000 shares periodically over the terms of the agreement). We are obligated to reimburse TAC in either cash for the fair market value of the TAC shares that are issued to Minquest or in the issuance of the equivalent value of All American shares as have a market value equal to the amount of the payment then due.\n6 The schedule of payments, stock issuances &amp; required property expenditures to be incurred by All American under the Belleville agreement is as followsOn September 11, 2012, we and TAC elected to terminate the agreement as the result of poor results and overburden issues; no further payment or share issues are required to be made..The Belleville Project is approximately 175 miles southeast of Reno, Nevada, and approximately 250 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, located near recent and historic producing mines including the Candelaria Silver Mine, which is ten miles to the east, and the Marietta Mine, six miles to the west. Both of these past producing mines lie within the Walker Lane structural and mineral belt, as does the Belleville Project, which is comprised of 10 unpatented mining claims spanning 74 acres."

In order to maintain this 35% interest, we are required to aggregate cash payments of $98,000 over a seven year period and incur an aggregate of $770,000 in exploration expenditures over a seven year period as described in the table below.\nIn addition, TAC was required to make certain share issuances to Minquest under the terms of the option agreement between them (1,000,000 shares periodically over the terms of the agreements). We were obligated to reimburse TAC in either cash for the fair market value of the TAC shares that were issued to Minquest or in the issuance of the equivalent value of All American shares as had a market value equal to the amount of the payment then due.\nThe schedule of payments, stock issuances &amp; required property expenditures to be incurred by All American under the Goldfields West agreement was as follows:7 * included as part of the cost of the acquisition of the agreement and paid by TACAfter reviewing a revised exploration program from Minquest and their engineers as to the planned exploration program for the current work season, TAC elected not to go forward and we followed suit. The issue involved a lack of sufficient results and the high cost of the projected exploration program with little or no indication of positive results from the program. Since we elected to terminate the option agreement, no further payment or share issues are required to be made.\nThe Goldfield West property is an exploration property comprised of 105 unpatented mining claims covering a total of 850 hectares or 2100 acres, approximately 3.5 hours northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, by car; it is approximately 3 miles west of the town of Goldfield and adjacent to International Minerals (IMZ) Goldfield properties and is easily accessed via well graded dirt roads."

In consideration of signing the Letter of Intent, we paid to Desert Pacific sum of $2,500 concurrently with the execution and delivery of the LOI.\nThe Bell Flats Project was comprised of 14 unpatented mining claims covering a total of 280 acres within the Nevada mining district, Churchill County, Nevada located approximately 5 miles north of Gabbs, Nevada and 25 miles north of the Paradise Peak mine. This project represents an exploration property with no defined resource. Extensive soil and rock sampling, geophysical surveys and drilling have identified several alteration zones along a corridor approximately 3,500 meters in length. Gold and silver occur developed along the contact of jasperoid and argillized Tertiary volcanic rock intermittently along the corridor. The mineralization has been encountered from surface to depths of 160 meters in drilling. Gold values exceed 5.1 g/t in trenching while silver values reach 200 g/t from historic drilling. The mineralized zone is open in all directions. A &#147;Santa Fe type&#148; model is indicated for the project based on the geology and alteration.\nThe project area encompasses a northwesterly trending structural zone. The structure cuts Tertiary felsic volcanic rocks and Triassic sediments which are the host rocks at the nearby Santa Fe gold-silver deposits.\nAlteration as jasperoid follows the contact of the Triassic limestone and Tertiary volcanic rocks. Shallow pits, trenches and drill holes have encountered gold and silver within argillized shale and jasperoid developed along this contact and within a clay altered felsic volcanic. Altered rocks are capped by post-mineral basalt and wind-blown sand.\nOn June 22, 2012, the Board, following consultation with our geological engineer, elected not to proceed with exploration work or to enter into an option agreement in regards to the Bell Flats mineral property. Our engineers advised that there was insufficient merit to the project and All American was advised to not enter into a mining option agreement with Desert Pacific to explore the project. As a result, we have no further obligations under the Letters of Intent on the project.8"

Our engineers advised that given the current mining climate, the high cost of a projected exploration program that did not indicate positive results would come from the exploration efforts that there was insufficient merit to the project and All American was advised to not enter into a mining option agreement to explore the project. As a result, we have no further obligations under the Mineral Property Acquisition.We do not claim to have any ores or reserves whatsoever at this time on any of our mineral properties.We are currently seeking other projects and mineral interests in which we may become involved that will have merit as potential positive mining projects.9 Item 1A"
