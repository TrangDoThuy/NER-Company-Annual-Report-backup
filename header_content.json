        "content": "Agilent is the world's premier measurement company, providing core electronic and bio-analytical measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.    In the first quarter of 2010, we formed three new operating segments from our existing businesses. The bio-analytical measurement segment was separated into two operating segments &#151; life sciences and chemical analysis. The electronic measurement segment recombined electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test, which were reported separately in 2009. Following this re-organization, Agilent has three businesses &#151; life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement. All historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this reporting structure in our financial statements.    On May 14, 2010, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Varian Inc. (\"Varian\") under the Merger Agreement, dated July 26, 2009. The results of Varian are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger. As part of the European Commission's merger approval and the Federal Trade Commission consent order, Agilent committed to sell Varian's laboratory gas chromatography (\"GC\") business; Varian's triple quadrupole gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (\"GC-MS\") business; Varian's inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (\"ICP-MS\") business; and Agilent's micro GC business. On May 19, 2010 we completed the sale of the Varian laboratory GC business, the triple quadrupole GC-MS business, the ICP-MS business and the Agilent micro GC business.    On May 1, 2010, we completed the sale of the Network Solutions Division (\"NSD\") of our electronic measurement business to JDS Uniphase Corporation (\"JDSU\"), a leading communications test and measurement company. NSD includes Agilent's network assurance solutions, network protocol test and drive test products.    On February 2, 2010, the company sold Hycor Biomedical Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, to Linden LLC, a Chicago-based healthcare private equity firm. Hycor is a global manufacturer and marketer of in vitro diagnostics products.    Agilent's total orders in 2010 were $5,744 million, an increase of 28 percent when compared to 2009. The increase in orders associated with the Varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our recently divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) accounted for 3 percentage points of order growth for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Agilent's total orders in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 as the global economy remained depressed.    Agilent's net revenue of $5,444 million increased 21 percent when compared to 2009. The revenue increase associated with the Varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our recently divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) accounted for 3 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition and Hycor divestiture, sales of life sciences products into applied and academic and government markets increased strongly and sales into pharmaceutical markets increased more modestly for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to the prior year. Excluding the Varian acquisition, sales to all end-markets grew significantly across the chemical analysis business for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Within electronic measurement, general purpose end-markets improved strongly in 2010 when compared to the prior year as a result of the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses. Also within electronic measurement, the communications test businesses improved in the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to the prior year with wireless R&amp;D and wireless manufacturing reporting strong revenue growth in the year. Agilent's total net revenue in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 with each of our businesses experiencing a decline in revenue compared to the prior year due to the economic downturn.    Net income was $684 million in 2010, a net loss of $31 million in 2009 and net income of $693 million in 2008. In 2010, 2009 and 2008 we generated operating cash flows of $718 million, $408 million and $756 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2010 and 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents balances $2,649 million and $2,479 million, respectively.    Our 2009 restructuring program, the (\"FY 2009 Plan\"), announced in the first half of 2009, was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle. Workforce reduction payments, primarily severance, were largely complete in fiscal year 2010.\nLease payments should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal 2014, and payments to suppliers in connection with inventory should be complete in fiscal year 2011. As of October 31, 2010, a small number of employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the FY 2009 Plan.   On May 14, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Varian, Inc. (\"Varian\"), a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and chemical analysis market applications, by means of a merger of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Varian such that Varian became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The $1.5 billion total purchase price of Varian included $52 cash per share of Varian's outstanding common stock including vested and non-vested in-the-money stock options at $52 cash per share less their exercise price. Varian's non-vested restricted stock awards, non-vested performance shares, at 100 percent of target, and non-vested director's stock units were also paid at $52 per share. As part of the European Commission's merger approval and the Federal Trade Commission consent order, Agilent committed to sell Varian's laboratory gas chromatography (\"GC\") business; Varian's triple quadrupole gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (\"GC-MS\") business; Varian's inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (\"ICP-MS\") business; and Agilent's micro GC business. On May 19, 2010 we completed the sale of the Varian laboratory GC business, the triple quadrupole GC-MS business, the ICP-MS business and the Agilent micro GC business for approximately $33 million. We financed the purchase price of Varian using the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash. The Varian merger has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of Varian are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the date of merger. We expect to realize operational and cost synergies, leverage the existing sales channels and product development resources, and utilize the assembled workforce. The company expects the combined entity to achieve significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs. The company also anticipates opportunities for growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional products and capabilities. For additional details related to the acquisition of Varian, see Note 3, \"Acquisition of Varian\".   Looking forward, while the economy remains uncertain, we continue to see numerous market opportunities and we believe Agilent is in a strong position to capitalize on them. We are focused on integrating Varian into Agilent throughout fiscal 2011 and our priority is to continue to drive revenue and cost synergies, as well as drive technology sharing between our businesses. We now believe that we will achieve $100 million in net savings as a result of the integration of Varian into Agilent."

        "header": "critical accounting policies and estimates",
        "content": "The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management.\nThose policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, investment impairments, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes.      Revenue recognition.  We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use verifiable objective evidence of fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, whether fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition.       Inventory valuation.  We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.      Investment impairments.  We recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our equity and debt securities and our cost-method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other-than-temporary. Significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.      Share-based compensation.  We account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Under the authoritative guidance, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which generally uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight-line basis. Our estimate of share-based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options), future forfeitures and related tax effects. We consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in estimating the expected life of our options granted, which we believe is representative of future behavior. In 2008 we used implied volatility of Agilent's publicly traded, similar priced stock options to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards. From 2009, we have moved to historical volatility of Agilent's stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are currently traded and our ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing. A 10 percent increase in our estimated volatility from 38 percent to 48 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 22 percent if no other factors were changed.   In the first quarter of 2009, we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from 4.6 years to 4.4 years. In revising this estimate, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our employees. In the first quarter of 2009, we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive employees, on average, exercise their options at 4.4 years. There was no change to the expected life of our employee stock options in 2010. See Note 4, \"Share-Based Compensation,\" to the consolidated financial statements for more information.   The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.      Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.  Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition.\nWe evaluate these assumptions at least annually.    The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date &#151; October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S.\nplans. For 2010, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. For 2009, the U.S.\ndiscount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve. The discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and either remained unchanged or decreased. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.    The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. A one percent change in the estimated long-term return on plan assets for 2010 would result in a $5 million impact on U.S. pension expense and a $16 million impact on non-U.S. pension expense.    The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were $82 million in 2010, $103 million in 2009, and $15 million in 2008.       Goodwill and purchased intangible assets.  Agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. We have three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes: life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement. We test goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill.    The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment, as our businesses operate in a number of markets and geographical regions. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which are formed by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization, taking into account an appropriate control premium. We then compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the fair value calculations based on the income approach. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments. The assumptions used in the fair value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates, operating margins, risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Changes in these assumptions based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods.    The circumstances that could trigger a goodwill impairment could include, but are not limited to, the following items to the extent that management believes the occurrence of one or more would make it more likely than not that we would fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test: significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, a portion of a reporting unit's goodwill has been included in the carrying amounts of a business that will be disposed or if our market capitalization is below our net book value.    The results of our test for goodwill impairment, as of September 30, 2010, showed that the estimated fair values of our life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement reporting units exceeded their carrying values. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate lowered the fair value by approximately 15 percent. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended October 31, 2010. We continue to assess the overall environment to determine if we would trigger and fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.   Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In process research and development (\"IPR&amp;D\") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&amp;D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&amp;D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.    We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in 2010 and recorded $13 million of impairment charges primarily related to a divested business.      Restructuring and asset impairment charges.  The four main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions, the consolidation of excess facilities, asset impairments and special charges related to inventory. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income. We recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities generally when we have vacated the premises. These estimates were derived using the authoritative accounting guidance. We have also assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. Asset impairments primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell. The charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and reserves taken against inventory on hand. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.       Accounting for income taxes.  We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.    Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. At October 31, 2010, we provided a partial valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets and either a full or partial valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal in the respective taxing jurisdiction.    We have not provided for all U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period.    The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. If the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated, a material impact on income tax expense could result."

        "content": "See Note 2, \"New Accounting Pronouncements,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.  Restructuring Costs, Asset Impairments and Other Charges    Our 2009 restructuring program, the (\"FY 2009 Plan\"), announced in the first half of 2009, was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle. Workforce reduction payments, primarily severance, were largely complete in fiscal year 2010. Lease payments should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal 2014, and payments to suppliers in connection with inventory should be complete in fiscal year 2011. As of October 31, 2010, a small number of employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the FY 2009 Plan.  Foreign Currency    Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (rolling twelve month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term.  Results from Operations  Orders and Net Revenue     Agilent's total orders in 2010 were $5,744 million, an increase of 28 percent when compared to 2009. The increase in orders associated with the Varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our recently divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) accounted for 3 percentage points of order growth for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009.\nAgilent's total orders in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 as the global economy remained depressed.   Agilent's net revenue of $5,444 million increased 21 percent when compared to 2009. The revenue increase associated with the Varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our recently divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) accounted for 3 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition and Hycor divestiture, sales of life sciences products into applied and academic and government markets increased strongly and sales into pharmaceutical markets increased more modestly for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to the prior year. Excluding the Varian acquisition, sales to all end-markets grew significantly across the chemical analysis business for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Within electronic measurement, general purpose end-markets improved strongly in 2010 when compared to the prior year being led by the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses. Also within electronic measurement, the communications test businesses improved in the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to the prior year with wireless R&amp;D and wireless manufacturing reporting strong revenue growth in the year. For the year ended October 31, 2010 Agilent's segment revenue was $5,463 million, an increase of 22 percent when compared to 2009. Note 21 shows a reconciliation between segment revenue and net revenue.    Agilent's total net revenue in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 with each of our businesses experiencing a decline in revenue compared to the prior year due to the economic downturn.    Services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting. Services and other revenue increased 7 percent in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in services and other revenue associated with the Varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to the network solutions divestiture accounted for 1 percentage point of revenue increase in 2010. Services and other revenue decreased 6 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 with service and other revenue showing signs of relative stability compared with product revenue in 2009."

        "content": "In 2010, total gross margin increased 3 percentage points in comparison to 2009. The benefits of business and infrastructure programs, lower restructuring costs, together with favorable volume impacts offset the unfavorable impact of the Varian acquisition (including fair value adjustments), wage restoration, higher variable and incentive pay. Operating margins in 2010 increased 9 percentage points as compared to 2009.    In January 2009, we implemented wage reductions across the company in response to deteriorating economic conditions. Those wage levels were fully restored to all employees effective November 1, 2009.    Research and development expenditures have decreased 5 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Increases in expenses due to the Varian acquisition, wage restoration, higher variable and incentive pay were more than offset by the impact of the divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) and decreased restructuring expenses.    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent during the year. Increased expenditure was due to the Varian acquisition, higher variable and incentive pay and wage restoration offset by the impact of decreased restructuring expenses and the divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses).    Gross inventory charges were $30 million in 2010, $54 million in 2009 and $24 million in 2008. Sales of previously written down inventory were $5 million in 2010, $8 million in 2009 and $6 million in 2008.    Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. We conduct five types of research and development: basic research, which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future; foundation technologies, which enables fundamental advances across all businesses; communications, which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information; life sciences, which enables next-generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes; and measurement, which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices, digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies; software, systems and solutions such as applied mathematics, knowledge management and measurement science; life sciences such as computational biology, molecular diagnostics and high-throughput measurements; and photonics, such as precision automation technology, optical switching and high-speed optical links. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20,000 products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. Due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses, there are a number of drivers of this expense.    For the year ended October 31, 2010 we recorded a $132 million gain on the sale of our network solutions business and $54 million of income in respect of a tax sharing settlement with Hewlett Packard Company.    At October 31, 2010, our headcount was approximately 18,500 compared to 16,800 in 2009 and 19,600 in 2008. The increase in our headcount in 2010, compared to 2009, was due to the Varian acquisition. The decrease in our headcount in 2009, compared to 2008, was due to our 2009 restructuring program. Provision for Income Taxes    For 2010, the annual effective tax rate was 1 percent. The 1 percent effective tax rate includes a $101 million beneficial release of the U.K. valuation allowance, a $32 million current year increase in prior year tax reserves, and tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. Also included is a $17 million tax benefit related to a $54 million non-taxable settlement payment received in connection with a tax sharing agreement between Agilent and Hewlett Packard Company. Without considering interest and penalties, the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances.\nWe intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.    For 2009, the annual effective tax rate was 543 percent. The 543 percent effective tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component of tax and that on reduced profitability unusual tax rate results. The tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. In addition, net tax benefits totaling $67 million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate. Without considering interest and penalties, the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions where we have recorded valuation allowances.    For 2008, the annual effective tax rate was 15 percent. The 15 percent effective tax rate includes a beneficial release of a portion of the U.S. federal and state valuation allowances which results in U.S. tax expense of nearly zero. It also includes tax on earnings in other jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. Without considering interest and penalties, the provision for taxes was recorded for income generated in jurisdictions other than the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, the U.S., and the U.K. where we have recorded valuation allowances.   Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore and Malaysia. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $62 million, $14 million and $112 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.18, $0.04 and $0.30 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.    During 2003, we established a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nDuring 2007, we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. During 2008, we maintained a partial U.S. federal valuation allowance and concluded that a significant portion of our U.S. state deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. During 2009 and 2010, we continued to maintain the partial valuation allowances for U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. In 2010, after consideration of all the available positive and negative evidence, we concluded that it is more likely than not that all of the U.K. deferred tax assets will be realized and reversed the entire valuation allowance.    In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.    On August 31, 2010 we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for tax years 2000 through 2002. The adjustments were offset by applying available net operating losses and had no material impact on our Statement of Operations. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 are under audit by the IRS. In December 2010, we reached an agreement with the IRS for tax years 2003-2005. In addition, Agilent and the IRS reached an agreement on transfer pricing issues covering years 2003-2007. Tax adjustments resulting from these agreements will be offset with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards."

        "content": "Agilent's global infrastructure organization (\"GIO\") remains a key component of our operating model. GIO, which includes IT, workplace services, human resources, legal, finance and other corporate functions, has reduced its cost structure over the past year in conjunction with the business restructuring that was completed. We will continue to efficiently manage and leverage our infrastructure resources to support our businesses in the coming year.  Segment Overview    Agilent is a measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences, chemical analysis, communications and electronics industries. Agilent has three primary businesses focused on the life sciences market, the chemical analysis market and the electronic measurement market.    In the first quarter of 2010, we formed three new operating segments from our existing businesses. The bio-analytical measurement segment was separated into two operating segments &#151; life sciences and chemical analysis. The electronic measurement segment recombined electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test, which were reported separately in 2009. Following this re-organization, Agilent has three businesses &#151; life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement &#151; each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three new operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including technology and delivery channels, consumer-specific solutions and specialized manufacturing, are considered in determining the formation of these new operating segments.    All historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements.  Life Sciences    Our life sciences business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Key product categories in life sciences include: DNA and RNA microarrays and associated scanner, software, and reagents; microfluidics-based sample analysis systems; liquid chromatography (LC) systems, columns and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) systems; capillary electrophoresis systems; laboratory software and informatics systems; bio-reagents and related products; laboratory automation and robotic systems, dissolution testing; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems along with X-Ray crystallography, and services and support for the aforementioned products.  Orders and Net Revenue    Life sciences orders in 2010 increased 24 percent compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition and the Hycor divestiture, orders grew 15 percent year over year. Order results were led by strength in the LC, microarray, and automation portfolios, along with consumables and services. This helped to offset soft sales in bio-reagents. We saw solid performance in new products, such as the 1200 Infinity LC Series and SureSelect Target Enrichment System. Growth in consumables was especially driven by sales of LC columns. Geographically, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and the Hycor divestiture, orders grew 15 percent in the Americas, 4 percent in Europe, 12 percent in Japan, and 31 percent in other Asia Pacific during 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2009, orders declined 6 percent when compared to 2008, impacted by the significant downturn in the global economy although the business was able to sustain growth in key markets such as academic and government.    Life sciences revenues in 2010 increased 21 percent compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition and the Hycor divestiture, revenue grew 14 percent year over year. In addition, foreign currency movements for 2010 had a favorable currency impact of 2 percentage points compared to 2009. Revenue growth was led by the LC, LCMS, informatics, genomics, and consumables portfolios. Geographically, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and the Hycor divestiture, revenues grew 14 percent in the Americas, 7 percent in Europe, 18 percent in Japan, and 25 percent in other Asia Pacific during 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2009, revenue declined 3 percent when compared to 2008, impacted by the significant downturn in the global economy with mixed results across geographies.    We saw growth in the pharmaceutical and biotech, academic, government, food, and other applied markets. Governments are investing in improving testing capabilities, with growing demand for LC and LCMS technology, along with consumables. In the research space, demand for life science application solutions (genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) is sustained. In the food market, interest in food safety remains with expanding opportunities on functional food testing using metabolomics studies. Other applied markets such as forensics, with interest in LCMS usage, are gaining momentum. Next generation sequencing continues on an aggressive growth path and is capturing a large portion of funding in the genomics field and the SureSelect Target Enrichment System can help our customers improve the cost and process efficiency of next generation sequencing.   Looking forward, we expect sustained growth in the academic, government, pharmaceutical and biotech markets to drive further demand in our instruments, reagents, application solutions, and consumables products. In our life sciences sales channel coverage model, we are specifically adding capabilities to address life science applications expertise. The life sciences business also remains focused on expanding our application portfolio for our customers. We have a strong line of new product introductions coming to drive further order and revenue growth.    In addition, our strategic focus is to ensure the successful integration of Varian. With the acquisition of Varian, the life sciences business now has an expanded product portfolio, including complementary products in liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, consumables, new offerings in dissolution testing, and magnetic resonance (NMR, MRI). Revenue synergies are expected with the expansion of our product portfolio and ability to offer new applications and solutions to life sciences customers. Cost synergies will result from leveraging our global infrastructure and our purchasing power.  Gross Margin and Operating Margin    The following table shows the life sciences business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2010 versus 2009, and 2009 versus 2008.    Gross margins for products and services in 2010 decreased 1 percentage point compared to 2009. Changes in 2010 were due to the impact of the Varian acquisition, wage restoration, higher variable pay and incentive pay, and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses partially offset by favorable volume impact. Gross margins improved by 1 percentage point in 2009 compared to 2008 as wage reductions, lower variable pay, lower global infrastructure costs and favorable currency movements were partially offset by lower volume and higher discounts.   Research and development expenses in 2010 increased 9 percent compared to 2009. In addition to an increase related to the Varian acquisition, the increase was due to selective investments in new product introductions, wage restoration, higher variable pay and incentive pay partially offset by lower shared corporate infrastructure expenses and the impact of the Hycor divestiture. Research and development expenses declined 2 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was driven by wage reductions, lower variable pay, lower global infrastructure costs and favorable foreign currency movements partially offset by increase in discretionary spending.   Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 20 percent compared to 2009. In addition to increases due to the Varian acquisition, increases resulted from the establishment and staffing of the dedicated life sciences sales channel, higher commissions, wage restoration, higher variable pay and incentive pay, and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses partially offset by the impact of the Hycor divestiture. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 3 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was driven by wage reductions, lower variable pay, lower global infrastructure costs and foreign currency movements.    Operating margins for products and services in 2010 increased 1 percentage point compared to 2009. Operating margins improved by 1 percentage point in 2009 compared to 2008. Factors which led to operating margin variances for these periods are collectively highlighted in the above discussions on gross margins, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses.  Income from Operations    Income from operations in 2010 increased by $47 million or 27 percent on a corresponding revenue increase of $260 million. The resultant year-over-year operating margin incremental was 18 percent. Operating margin incremental is measured by the increase in income compared to prior period from operations divided by the increase in revenue compared to the prior period. Income from operations in 2009 increased by $8 million or 5 percent compared to 2008 on a revenue decrease of $39 million due to the temporary wage and variable pay reduction. Chemical Analysis    Our chemical analysis business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Key product categories in chemical analysis include: gas chromatography systems, columns and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry products; spectroscopy products; software and data systems; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies; services and support for the aforementioned products.  Orders and Net Revenue    Chemical analysis orders in 2010 increased 43 percent compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition, orders grew 17 percent year-over-year.\nOrder results were led by solid performance in the gas chromatography (\"GC\"), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (\"GC-MS\"), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (\"ICP-MS\"), and vacuum pump portfolios, along with services and consumables. Growth in the services and support business was driven by strong instrument orders. Geographically, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition, orders grew 17 percent in the Americas, 9 percent in Europe, 21 percent in Japan, and 25 percent in other Asia Pacific during 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2009, orders declined 11 percent when compared to 2008, impacted by the significant downturn in the global economy although the business was able to sustain growth in the food safety and China markets.    Chemical analysis revenues for the 2010 increased 42 percent compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition, revenue grew 15 percent year-over-year. Revenue growth was led by the GC, GC-MS, ICP-MS, mid-range GC, and vacuum pump portfolios, along with consumables.\nGeographically, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition, revenues grew 13 percent in the Americas, 8 percent in Europe, 24 percent in Japan, and 21 percent in other Asia Pacific during 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2009 revenue declined 10 percent when compared to 2008, impacted by the significant downturn in the global economy with declines in our main geographies, except for China.    We saw continued robust growth in the petrochemical, food, and environmental markets. The hydrocarbon processing industry within the petrochemical market is recovering from the recession. The food market remains strong for pesticide, veterinary medicine, and emerging applications worldwide. United States stimulus funding has prompted increased construction projects, leading to growth in air, water, and soil testing. China's government continues to invest in environmental protection and improvement, with emphasis on drinking water quality. European directives continue to be the major business drivers for environmental analysis in both the public and private sector, with emphasis on emissions testing for construction materials.   Looking forward, we look to strengthen our core business, drive growth, and build upon current success in customer satisfaction. We plan to strengthen our core business by expanding our mid-range portfolio with GC-MS and GC solutions, improving our gross margins, and driving customer intimacy. We intend to drive growth by focusing on the emerging food market and exceptional geographic growth opportunities in China. We also plan to expand our consumables business and high-end mass spectrometry portfolio.    In addition, our strategic focus is to ensure the successful integration of Varian. With the acquisition of Varian, the chemical analysis product portfolio now has new offerings in spectroscopy and vacuum technologies, complementary mass spectrometry products, and an expanded consumables portfolio. Revenue synergies are expected as a result of the new product portfolio and broader customer and geographic reach. Cost synergies will result from leveraging our global infrastructure and our purchasing power."

The resultant year-over-year operating margin incremental was 18 percent. Income from operations in 2009 decreased by $28 million or 12 percent compared to 2008 on a corresponding revenue decrease of $93 million, a 30 percent year-over-year operating margin decremental.  Electronic Measurement    Our electronic measurement business provides electronic measurement instruments and systems, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment, and microscopy products. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle.  Orders and Net Revenue    Electronic measurement orders increased 25 percent in 2010, a significant improvement from the 31 percent decline in 2009 when overall demand was negatively impacted by broad economic weakness.\nForeign currency movements had a slightly favorable impact on the year-over-year growth rate. In our general purpose test business, growth was led by improvement in the computers and semiconductor market with solid performance in aerospace and defense and industrial applications. In our communications test business, strengthening wireless R&amp;D and manufacturing related demand was partially offset by a decline in network monitoring associated with the divestiture of the network solutions business. On a geographic basis, 2010 orders increased 14 percent in the Americas, 19 percent in Europe, 29 percent in Japan and 45 percent in other Asia Pacific. Electronic measurement orders declined 31 percent in 2009 compared to 2008, as order trends deteriorated and then improved with the global economic recovery and strengthening demand, particularly in our general purpose segment.    Electronic measurement revenues grew 15 percent in 2010 compared to a 32 percent decline in 2009 due to a broad-based recovery across both general purpose and communications test markets. Foreign currency movements were slightly favorable, contributing to the year-over-year growth in 2010. Regionally, revenues from the Americas increased 8 percent, Europe grew 12 percent, Japan improved 7 percent and other Asia Pacific increased 32 percent compared to 2009. Revenue from products increased 20 percent year-over-year while service related revenue declined as a result of the divestiture of the network solutions business. Electronic measurement revenues declined 32 percent in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting weakness across general purpose and communications test markets in all geographies.    General purpose test revenues, representing approximately 64 percent of electronic measurement revenues, reflected strength in the computers and semiconductor business, solid growth in aerospace and defense, and improvement in demand from industrial customers. Strength in the computers and semiconductor business reflected the growing demand for cell phones, computers and electronics. Aerospace and defense business growth was consistent with the focus in the United States on improving information management, with faster growth in surveillance and intelligence, and increased spending in Asia. Overall improvement in economic conditions contributed to more demand from customers with industrial or general purpose applications. General purpose test revenues, representing approximately 63 percent of electronic measurement revenue in 2009, reflected declines across all market segments with steeper declines in the computer and semiconductor and other general purpose test business.    Communications test revenues, representing approximately 36 percent of electronic measurement revenues, experienced growth in wireless R&amp;D and manufacturing test, offset partially by a decline in network monitoring business resulting from the divestiture of the network solutions business. Wireless R&amp;D grew as market conditions improved and targeted investments increased for high data rate applications, including long-term evolution (an emerging wireless standard). Wireless manufacturing business increased due to strong demand relating to Smartphones and 3G expansion. Performance in other communications test submarket reflected growth in broadband revenues offset by the unfavorable impact of the network solutions divestiture. Communications test revenues, representing approximately 37 percent of electronic measurement revenues in 2009, reflected weakness across all end markets, particularly wireless manufacturing.    Looking forward, we expect growth rates will moderate as a result of comparisons to stronger 2010 results, particularly for the general purpose test business. We expect continuing demand from our key market segments to support overall growth in the near term, subject to continuing economic expansion and stability in the semiconductor industry."

Gross margins for products and services increased 5 percentage points year-over-year in 2010 due to higher volume, lower cost structure and favorable currency impact. Volume-adjusted gross margins improved relative to 2009 primarily due to savings from restructuring programs, favorable currency impact including hedging gains and lower infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by wage restoration and higher variable pay. Gross margins for products and services declined 4 percentage points year-over-year in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to the significant decline in revenue.   Research and development expenses in 2010 declined $34 million, or 8 percent, compared to 2009.

The resultant year-over-year operating margin incremental is expected to moderate going forward as compares are made against relatively stronger 2010 results. Income from operations declined by $476 million in 2009 compared to 2008 on a revenue decrease of $1,161 million, a 41 percent year-over-year operating margin decremental as structural and operational expense reductions offset the unfavorable impact of lower revenue. Financial Condition  Liquidity and Capital Resources    As of October 31, 2010, approximately 37 percent of our cash and cash equivalents is held in the U.S. and 40 percent is held in a centrally managed global cash pool outside the U.S. Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Agilent has accrued for U.S. federal and state tax liabilities on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Repatriation could result in additional U.S. federal and state income tax payments in future years. We utilize a variety of financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.    Our financial position as of October 31, 2010 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2,649 million as compared to $2,479 million as of October 31, 2009. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities   Net cash provided by operating activities was $718 million in 2010 compared to $408 million provided in 2009 mainly due to improved operating results. We paid approximately $48 million in taxes in 2010 as compared to $113 million in the same period in 2009. In 2008, we generated $756 million in net cash provided by operating activities.    In 2010, accounts receivable used cash of $166 million as compared to cash provided of $193 million in 2009. Days' sales outstanding were 50 days in 2010 as compared to 46 days in 2009. Accounts payable provided cash of $113 million in 2010 as compared to cash used of $7 million in 2009. Cash used in inventory was $51 million in 2010 compared to cash provided of $47 million in 2009. Inventory day's on-hand decreased to 87 days in 2010 compared to 93 days in 2009.    We contributed $30 million and $37 million to our U.S. defined benefit plans in 2010 and 2009, respectively. We contributed $47 million and $71 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2010 and 2009, respectively. We contributed $1 million to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans in 2010 and 2009. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. Total contributions in 2010 were $78 million or 28 percent less than 2009. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We expect to contribute approximately $83 million to our U.S.\nand non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2011. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities   Net cash used in investing activities in 2010 was $1,174 million compared to $14 million used in 2009. In 2008, we used $399 million of net cash in the investing activities of operations.    Investments in property, plant and equipment were $121 million in 2010 and $128 million in 2009. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment were $7 million in 2010 as compared to $1 million in 2009. In 2010, we invested $1,313 million in acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets compared to $2 million in 2009 which was primarily related to our acquisition of Varian. In 2008, we invested $172 million in acquisitions of businesses and purchase of intangible assets. In 2010, we did not purchase any investment securities as compared to $30 million in 2009. Proceeds from the sale of such securities in 2010 were $38 million as compared to $94 million in 2009. Proceeds from divestitures were $205 million in 2010, primarily our network solutions and Hycor businesses, compared to $45 million in 2009. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities   Net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 was $601 million compared to $657 million provided in 2009. In 2008, we used $774 million in financing activities. Treasury stock repurchases   On November 19, 2009 our Board of Directors approved a share-repurchase program to reduce or eliminate dilution of basic outstanding shares in connection with issuances of stock under the company's equity incentive plans. The share-repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. There is no fixed termination date for the new share-repurchase program. For the year ended October 31, 2010 we repurchased 13 million shares for $411 million using settlement date calculation. Credit Facility   On May 11, 2007, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300 million unsecured credit facility that will expire on May 11, 2012. On September 8, 2009, we entered into an Accession Agreement, increasing the credit facility from $300 million to $330 million. The company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2010 the company has no borrowings outstanding under the facility. Short-term debt   We currently hold $1.5 billion of short-term debt (the \"World Trade Debt\") which was refinanced and the repayment date was extended to January 27, 2011. We satisfied the financing obligation of World Trade in its entirety on December 10, 2010 using the proceeds of our senior notes issued in July 2010 and existing cash on our balance sheet. Long-term debt   On October 24, 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.60% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on November 1, 2017, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 st  and November 1 st  of each year and payments commenced on May 1, 2008.   On November 25, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $400 million. The asset value upon termination was approximately $43 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2010 was $35 million.    On September 9, 2009, Agilent issued two tranches of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $750 million, a $250 million tranche maturing in 2012 (the \"2012 notes\") and a $500 million tranche maturing in 2015 (the \"2015 notes\"). The 2012 notes were issued at 99.91% of their principal amount, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.45% per annum, and mature on September 14, 2012. The 2015 notes were issued at 99.69% of their principal amount, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per annum, and mature on September 14, 2015. Interest on both tranches is payable semi-annually on March 14th and September 14th of each year, and payments commenced on March 14, 2010.    On July 13, 2010, Agilent issued two tranches of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $750 million, a $250 million tranche maturing in 2013 (the \"2013 notes\") and a $500 million tranche maturing in 2020 (the \"2020 notes\"). The 2013 notes were issued at 99.82% of their principal amount, bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.50% per annum and mature on July 15, 2013. The 2020 notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum, and mature on July 15, 2020. Interest on both tranches is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year, payments commencing on January 15, 2011.    Upon the closing of the offering of the 2012, 2015 and 2020 senior notes, we entered into interest rate swaps for the full aggregate notional amount of the aforementioned tranches, $1,250 million. Under the interest rate swaps, we will receive fixed-rate interest payments and will make payments based on the U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 253 basis points, 257.6 basis points and 179 basis points with respect to the 2015, 2012 and 2020 senior notes, respectively. The economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed-rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable LIBOR-based interest rate. The hedging relationship qualifies for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness, and consequently we do not expect any ineffectiveness during the life of the swap and any movement in the value of the swap would be reflected in the movement in fair value of the senior notes. At October 31, 2010, the fair value of the swaps was an asset of $61 million with a corresponding increase in carrying value of the senior notes.   On August 11, 2008, a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, borrowed Indian Rupees equivalent to $15 million from Citibank N.A. to finance a capital project in India. On March 30, 2010 we paid off this debt completely.    On June 3, 2010, as a result of the Varian acquisition, the company also paid $14 million to satisfy an outstanding term loan of Varian with a U.S. financial institution which had a fixed interest rate of 6.7%. The $14 million payment of the term loan included an early termination fee of $2 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other    We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 17 \"Commitments and Contingencies\", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.    Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.  Contractual Commitments    Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.    The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2010 for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions):    Operating leases.  Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property.    Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.  We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are non-cancelable. Therefore, only approximately 40 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. We expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year.    In addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2010, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was $4 million, compared to same amount as of October 31, 2009. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.    Other purchase commitments.  These relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers. Purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a 90-day period without significant penalties.    Retirement Plans.  Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans.    We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2010 or October 31, 2009. On Balance Sheet Arrangements   The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet pertaining to long-term debt (in millions):    We have contractual obligations for interest payments on the above debts. Interest rates and payment dates are detailed in \"Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\".    As of October 31, 2010, $430 million of taxes payable are included in other long-term liabilities. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be paid or released."
