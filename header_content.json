        "content": "Our products fall into eight main areas of work: liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, software and informatics, lab automation and robotics, vacuum technology and cell analysis. Our key products and applications include the following technologies: Liquid Chromatography A liquid chromatograph (\"LC\") or a high-performance liquid chromatograph (\"HPLC\") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. The Agilent LC portfolio is modular in construction and can be configured as analytical and preparative systems. These systems can be stepwise upgraded to highly sophisticated, automated workflow solutions such as method development, multi&#8209;method/walk-up, high-capacity/high-throughput or multi&#8209;dimensional LC and can be extended to application&#8209;based analyzers (e.g.,&#160;for bio-molecular separations, chiral analysis or size exclusion chromatography). As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns, new services and diagnostics offerings and ongoing instrument and software product enhancements. Gas Chromatography  Agilent is the world's leading provider of gas chromatographs (\"GC\"), both laboratory and portable models. GCs are used to separate any gas, liquid or solid that can be vaporized and then detect the molecules present to determine their identity and quantity. Agilent provides custom or standard analyzers configured for specific chemical analysis applications, such as detailed speciation of a complex hydrocarbon stream, calculation of gas calorific values in the field, or analysis of a new bio-fuel formulation. We also offer related software, accessories and consumable products for these and other similar instruments.  Mass Spectrometry  A mass spectrometer (&#8220;MS&#8221;) identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical's molecular mass and characteristic patterns of fragment ion masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Liquid chromatography is commonly used to separate compounds and introduce them to the MS system. The combined use of LC and MS is frequently used both to identify and quantify chemical compounds. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing small molecules and can also be used to characterize and quantify proteins and other biological entities. Agilent's LCMS portfolio includes instruments built around four main analyzer types&#160;- single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, time-of-flight (\"TOF\") and quadrupole time-of-flight (\"QTOF\"). Agilent's GC/MS portfolio includes instruments built around three main analyzer types - single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, and quadrupole time-of-flight (\"QTOF\"). We significantly expanded our mass spectrometry portfolio in recent years with a focus on improving performance, sensitivity, and ease of use.  Spectroscopy  Spectroscopy is a technique for analyzing the individual chemical components of substances based on the absorption or emission of electromagnetic radiation of specific wavelengths of light. Our spectroscopy instruments include AA spectrometers, microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometers (\"MP-AES\"), ICP-OES, ICP-MS, fluorescence spectrophotometers, ultraviolet-visible (\"UV-Vis\") spectrophotometers, Fourier Transform infrared (\"FT-IR\" spectrophotometers, near-infrared (\"NIR\") spectrophotometers, raman spectrometers and sample automation products. We also offer related software, accessories and consumable products for these and other similar instruments.  Software and Informatics  We provide software for instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, laboratory content and business process management, and informatics. Our software facilitates the compliant use of instruments in pharmaceutical quality assurance/quality control environments. With our OpenLab Laboratory Software Suite, Agilent has a scalable, open software platform that enables customers to capture, analyze, and share scientific data throughout the lab and across the enterprise.
