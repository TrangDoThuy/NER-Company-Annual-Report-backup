<p align="justify"><b>Item 1. Description of Business.</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Overview</b></p>
<p align="justify">We were incorporated in the State of Wyoming on May 17, 2006,
as Osprey Ventures, Inc. and established a fiscal year end of May 31. On October
15, 2010 we changed our name to All American Gold Corp. and effected an 10:1
forward split of our common stock. Our statutory registered agent's office is
located at 1620 Central Avenue, Suite 202, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82001 and our
business office is located at 700 North High School Road, Suite 203,
Indianapolis, IN 46214. Our telephone number is (317) 926-4653 or (888) 755-9766
and our e-mail address is info@allamericangoldcorp.com.</p>
<p align="justify">There have been no material reclassifications, mergers,
consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in
the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation. We are a
start-up, exploration stage company engaged in the search for gold and related
minerals. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit, a
reserve, exists in our mineral properties or can be shown to exist until
sufficient and appropriate exploration is done and a comprehensive evaluation of
such work concludes economic and legal feasibility.</p>

Projects</u></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Mineral Property Interests – State of Nevada – U.S.A. (with
TAC and Minquest)</b></p>
<p align="justify">On August 23, 2010, we entered into three agreements with TAC
Gold Inc. (“TAC”), a Canadian reporting issuer which trades on the Canadian
National Stock Exchange (CNSX), in regards to the acquisition of certain
property interests. The interests that we acquired are as follows:</p>
<ul style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<li>A 70% interest in a mineral exploration property called the “Belleville”
  property in Mineral County, Nevada subject to our making certain payments,
  share issuances and exploration expenditures through 2016. TAC has an
  underlying option agreement with Minquest Inc. for the acquisition of a 100%
  interest in the property (under which agreement Minquest has retained a 3% net
  smelter return royalty);
  <li>A 35% interest in a mineral exploration property called the “Goldfield
  West” property in Esmeralda County, Nevada subject to our making certain
  payments, share issuances and exploration expenditures through 2017. TAC has
  an underlying option agreement with Minquest Inc. for the acquisition of a
  100% interest in the property; and
  <li>A right of first refusal on an exploration property called the “Iowa
  Canyon” property in Lander County, Nevada for period of 12½ months to
  September 9, 2011, as amended on August 10, 2011. </li></li></li></ul>

the obligations of TAC under their agreement with Minquest which consists of All
American:</p>
<ul style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<li>Making payments in the aggregate amount of $170,000 in annual periodic
  payments ranging from $20,000 to $50,000, to the sixth anniversary of the

  in annual amounts ranging from $120,000 to $400,000, to the seventh

<p align="justify">In addition, TAC is required to make certain share issuances to
Minquest under the terms of the option agreements between them (700,000 shares
periodically over the terms of the agreement). We are obligated to reimburse TAC
in either cash for the fair market value of the TAC shares that are issued to
Minquest or in the issuance of the equivalent value of All American shares as
have a market value equal to the amount of the payment then due. </p>

<p align="justify">Technically, as of the date of this report, we are in default
of the agreement for not having issued shares to TAC and for not having paid the
$150,000 property expenditure and the property payment. However, TAC has not yet
submitted the appropriate documentation for their share issuance to Minquest so
we currently do not have a basis upon which to make our share issuance to TAC.
We have been informed that TAC will complete their submission by the end of the
first full week of September at which time we intend to make our payment to TAC.
Further, we are still awaiting a formalized exploration program from TAC,
Minquest and their engineers as to the planned exploration program for the
current work season; we expect to be in a position to move forward in September,
2012 and will make whatever expenditures are required at that time. In the event
that we elect to terminate the agreement, no payment or share issues would be
required to be made. Should TAC fail to issue the shares under its agreements
with Minquest or fail to make its required property expenditures, All American
would either have to negotiate with Minquest and form a new agreement between
Minquest and All American or terminate the agreement and lose our interest in
the property or make some other mutually agreeable arrangement with the parties
involved.</p>

<p align="justify">The Goldfield West property is an advanced exploration property
with defined targets comprised of 105 unpatented mining claims covering a total
of 850 hectares or 2100 acres. It is approximately 3.5 hours northwest of Las
Vegas, Nevada, by car; approximately 3 miles west of the town of Goldfield and
adjacent to International Minerals (IMZ) Goldfield properties. It is easily
accessed via well graded dirt roads. </p>
<p align="justify">Geologically, the Goldfield West property encompasses an area
of Tertiary volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks. The USGS and several mineral
exploration companies hypothesize that the western edge of a caldera rim runs
through the property. Historic work conducted by Bear Creek, Placer Amex, U.S.
Borax, North Mining and Bonaventure Enterprises has led to the completion of 138
drill holes. The data compiled from drilling results and a wealth of information
gathered through geological mapping, geochemical sampling and geophysical
surveys have identified three distinct targets over a strike length of 3.5
miles.</p>
<p align="justify">We believe that the property has the potential to host a gold
resource in these Tertiary age volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks. Surface
samples collected from old workings and outcrops have exceeded 15 g/t. </p>

<p align="justify" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%">The Essex Project is comprised of 18
unpatented mining claims covering a total of 360 acres within the Nevada mining
district, White Pine County, Nevada and is located approximately 10 miles
southeast of Ely, Nevada. This project represents an advanced stage exploration
property with no defined resource. However, drilling on roughly 400 feet centers
with significant underground workings have identified a mineralized zone
approximately 4,500 feet in length and open in both directions. The project area
encompasses a northwesterly trending structural zone which can be followed along
strike for over 2,500 meters. The structure cuts Devonian Guillemette limestone,
Devonian/Mississippian Pilot shale, Mississippian Joana limestone, and
Mississippian Chainman shale which are the host rocks in the “Alligator Ridge”
district. Workings and drill holes have encountered gold and silver within a
jasperoid developed along Joana-Chainman contact zone where it plunges to the
west. The mineralization has been followed to depths of 700 feet in historic
workings. </p>
<p align="justify" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%">Historic work in the area was initiated
as early as 1869 when a minor amount of silver was produced. Production started
again in the early 1900’s when manganese ore was shipped. Gold and silver was
mined from 1936 to 1939. </p>
<p align="justify" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%">Recent exploration includes 2 holes by
Newmont in 1978, 7 holes by Homestake in 1980, and 26 holes by Echo Bay from
1988 to 1989. This work defines a corridor of gold and silver mineralization
trending northwesterly for over 2,500 meters. The zone is lost under alluvial
cover to the southeast and northwest, but appears to continue based on CSMT
surveys conducted by Cominco in 1996.</p>

<p align="justify" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%">The Bell Flats Project is comprised of
14 unpatented mining claims covering a total of 280 acres within the Nevada
mining district, Churchill County, Nevada and is located approximately 5 miles
north of Gabbs, Nevada and 25 miles north of the Paradise Peak mine. This
project represents an advanced stage exploration property with no defined
resource. Extensive soil and rock sampling, geophysical surveys and drilling
have identified several alteration zones along a corridor approximately 3,500
meters in length. Gold and silver occur developed along the contact of jasperoid
and argillized Tertiary volcanic rock intermittently along the corridor. The
mineralization has been encountered from surface to depths of 160 meters in
drilling. Gold values exceed 5.1 g/t in trenching while silver values reach 200
g/t from historic drilling. The mineralized zone is open in all directions. A
“Santa Fe type” model is indicated for the project based on the geology and
alteration. </p>
<p align="justify" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%">The project area encompasses a
northwesterly trending structural zone. The structure cuts Tertiary felsic
volcanic rocks and Triassic sediments which are the host rocks at the nearby
Santa Fe gold-silver deposits. Alteration as jasperoid follows the contact of
the Triassic limestone and Tertiary volcanic rocks. Shallow pits, trenches and
drill holes have encountered gold and silver within argillized shale and
jasperoid developed along this contact and within a clay altered felsic
volcanic. Altered rocks are capped by post-mineral basalt and wind-blown sand.

from the property. </p>
<p align="justify" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%">Recent exploration includes several
holes by Dome exploration in 1985 and 9 holes by Hemlo Gold in 1993. Hemlo also
conducted an IP survey resulting in 9 lines on the north half of the property.
Homeland Precious Metals collected over 300 auger soil samples in 2005. The

<p align="justify"><b>Item 1A Risk Factors</b></p>
<p align="justify">Our business operations are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to those set forth below:</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>1. We need to continue as a going concern if our business
is to succeed.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">Our registered public accounting firm’s report to our audited
financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2012, indicates that there are a
number of factors that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. Such factors identified in the report are our lack of
sufficient working capital, significant operating losses, our failure to attain
profitable operations and our dependence upon adequate financing to pay our
liabilities. </p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>2. Because of the unique difficulties and uncertainties
inherent in mineral exploration ventures, we face a high risk of business
failure.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties
normally encountered by new mineral exploration companies and the high rate of
failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in
light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays
encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral properties that we
plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to,
unanticipated problems relating to exploration, and additional costs and
expenses that may exceed current estimates. The expenditures to be made by us in
the exploration of the mineral claim may not result in the discovery of mineral
deposits. Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions
are involved in mineral exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration
efforts. If the results of our exploration do not reveal viable commercial
mineralization, we may decide to abandon our claim and acquire new claims for
new exploration. The acquisition of additional claims will be dependent upon us
possessing capital resources at the time in order to purchase such claims. </p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>3. Because we have limited business operations, we face a
high risk of business failure.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">We were incorporated on May 17, 2006, and have been involved
primarily in organizational activities, acquisition and exploration of our
mineral properties. We have not earned any revenues as of the date of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<p align="justify">Prior to completion of our exploration stage, we anticipate
that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues.
We therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We
recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from
development of the mineral claims and the production of minerals from the
claims, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the
likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no
assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve
profitable operations. </p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>4. We lack an operating history and we expect to have
losses in the future.</i></b></p>
</div><div class="pagination__item">
<!--$$/page=--><a name="page_10"></a>
<p align="right">10</p>
<p align="justify">We have not realized any revenues. We have no operating history
upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our
ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is
dependent upon the following:</p>
<ul style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<li>Our ability to locate a profitable mineral property
  <li>Our ability to generate revenues; and
  <li>Our ability to reduce exploration costs. </li></li></li></ul>
<p align="justify">Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses
in future periods. This will happen because there are expenses associated with
the exploration of our mineral properties. We cannot guarantee that we will be
successful in generating revenues in the future. </p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>5. Because of the inherent dangers involved in mineral
exploration, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages as we
conduct our business.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">The search for valuable minerals involves numerous hazards. As
a result, we may become subject to liability for such hazards, including
pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which we cannot insure or against
which we may elect not to insure. The payment of such liabilities may have a
material adverse effect on our financial position.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>6. If we become subject to onerous government regulation
or other legal uncertainties, our business will be negatively
affected.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">There are several governmental regulations that materially
restrict mineral property exploration and development. Under the mining laws of
Nevada, we are required to obtain work permits, the posting of bonds, and the
performance of remediation work for any physical disturbance to the land. While
these current laws do not affect our current exploration plans, if we proceed to
commence drilling operations on the mineral claims, we will incur modest
regulatory compliance costs.</p>
<p align="justify">In addition, the legal and regulatory environment that pertains
to the exploration of ore is uncertain and may change. Uncertainty and new
regulations could increase our costs of doing business and prevent us from
exploring for ore deposits. The growth of demand for ore may also be
significantly slowed. This could delay growth in potential demand for and limit
our ability to generate revenues. In addition to new laws and regulations being
adopted, existing laws may be applied to mining that have not as yet been
applied. These new laws may increase our cost of doing business with the result
that our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>7. We may not have access to all of the supplies and
materials we need to begin exploration that could cause us to delay or suspend
operations.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the
industry could result in occasional spot shortages of supplies, such as
explosives, and certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators that we
might need to conduct exploration. We have not attempted to locate or negotiate
with any suppliers of products, equipment or materials. If we cannot find the
products and equipment we need, we will have to suspend our exploration plans
until we do find the products and equipment we need.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>8. Because the SEC imposes additional sales practice
requirements on brokers who deal in our shares because they are classed as penny
stocks, some brokers may be unwilling to trade them. Thus you may have
difficulty in reselling your shares and which may cause the price of the shares
to decline.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">Our shares qualify as penny stocks and are covered by Section
15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which imposes additional sales
practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell our securities in this offering
or in the aftermarket. In particular, prior to selling a penny stock,
broker/dealers must give the prospective customer a risk disclosure document
that contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for
penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; contains a
description of the broker/dealers' duties to the customer and of the rights and
remedies available to the customer with respect to violations of such duties or
other requirements of Federal securities laws; contains a brief, clear,
narrative description of a dealer market, including "bid" and "ask" prices for
penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask prices;
contains the toll free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions
established pursuant to section 15(A)(i); defines significant terms used in the
disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and contains
such other information, and is in such form (including language, type size, and
format), as the SEC requires by rule or regulation. Further, for sales of our
securities, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination and
receive from you a written agreement before making a sale to you. Because of the
imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that
brokers will not want to make a market in our shares. This could prevent you
from reselling your shares and may cause the price of the shares to decline.</p>

<p align="right">11</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>9. Rain and snow may make the road leading to our
property impassable. This will delay our proposed exploration operations and
could prevent us from working.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">While we do not plan to conduct our exploration year round, it
is possible that when we plan to proceed with exploration that snow or rain
could cause roads leading to our claims to be impassable. When roads are
impassable, we are unable to work.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>10. As we face intense competition in the mining
industry, we will have to compete with our competitors for financing and for
qualified managerial and technical employees.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">The mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its
phases. Competition includes large established mining companies with substantial
capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than we have. As
a result of this competition, we may be unable to acquire additional attractive
mining claims or financing on terms we consider acceptable. We also compete with
other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial
and technical employees. If we are unable to successfully compete for financing
or for qualified employees, our exploration and development programs may be
slowed down or suspended.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>11. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC's
Penny Stock Regulations which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell
our stock.</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define "penny
stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than
$5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to
certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which
impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to
persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term
"accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of
$5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual
income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock
rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not
otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure
document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny
stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The
broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer
quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its
salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market
value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer
quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must
be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction
and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's
confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a
transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is
a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written
agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect
of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock
that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock
rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We
believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the
marketability of, our common stock.</p>

<p align="justify"><u>Location and Access</u></p>
<p align="justify">The Belleville project lies about equidistant from the towns of
Hawthorne and Tonopah (approximately 60 miles to either). It is situated in T4N,
R34E, Mineral County, Nevada, about 175 miles south-southeast of Reno and approximately 250 miles northwest of Las Vegas (see
Figure 1, Location Map). Labor force, drill water and supplies would be
available from Tonopah or Hawthorne, Nevada. Access is from Nevada SR 360, which
junctions with US 95 about 12 miles north of the old abandoned mining and
milling site of Belleville. From just south of Belleville, an unimproved gravel
road heads westward across an alluvial fan and accesses the eastern part of the
claims. The remainder of the claim block is not accessible by vehicle.</p>
</div><div class="pagination__item">
<!--$$/page=--><a name="page_14"></a>
<p align="right">14</p>
<p align="justify">Elevations range from 5,600 feet at the range front to over
6,200 feet on the ridges to the west. Vegetation is sparse; range front is
relatively steep and drainages are typically steep and rocky. The climate is
typical high desert, western Nevada, with hot summers, cool evenings and some
snow in the winter, especially at higher elevations. Exploration or mining could
be conducted year round. The project is comprised of ten, unpatented mining
claims (approximately 75 acres) on land administered by the US Bureau of Land
Management (BLM).</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Figure 1 – General Location of Belleville Property –
Esmeralda County, Nevada</i></p>
<p align="justify"><u>History</u></p>
<p align="justify">Prior to the involvement of All American, exploration efforts
at Belleville had consisted of a mapping and sampling program, geophysical
surveys, and a limited reverse circulation program completed in 2009. Three
potential drilling targets were been identified, one of which is a set of gold
bearing shear zones. The second drill target is a geophysical anomaly indicating
the apparent extension of the mineralized shears under pediment. Belleville's
third target occurs at the intersection of the mineralized structures with a
major lithologic contact. </p>
<p align="justify"><u>Mineralization</u> </p>
</div><div class="pagination__item">
<!--$$/page=--><a name="page_15"></a>
<p align="right">15</p>
<p align="justify">Exposed rocks at Belleville are meta-sediments and
meta-volcanics of the Triassic Excelsior formation. Also exposed on the property
is a granite intrusion of late Mesozoic age. Several old pits and adits are
developed along two semi-parallel shears in the Excelsior package. These shears
contain quartz veins, stockworks and varying amounts of iron and copper
minerals. Rock chip samples from these workings have revealed as much as 53
parts per million (ppm) gold.</p>
<p align="justify">Significant gold and silver mineralization has so far been
detected only within the NESW trending shear/vein systems described above.
Although these shears are rarely more than a few feet wide, they persist for at
least 1000 feet along strike. Surface samples were mainly grab samples from
prospect pits and dumps. Sampling of the many short adits that occur on the
property consisted of chip channel sampling across the ceilings (backs) which
gives information on width as well as grade. All adit samples were across the
veins using a 2.0 foot width (0.6 meters). </p>
<p align="justify">Adit sampling shows the northern vein zone to be the strongest.
Within this zone adit BA-3 shows the best values with a high of 7.29 ppm gold.
This part of the vein appears to be bending to the left which is consistent with
dilation of a left lateral fault. This area is considered the best portion of a
drilling target that extends from above the range front approximately 1,200 feet
to the southwest. At the range front the structure is present but appears to be
only weakly altered. This is the second drilling target defined at Belleville.
</p>
<p align="justify">Examination of the surface geology within the Belleville
project reveals a disconformable contact between a meta-andesite/basalt unit and
underlying lithologies. This unit appears to sit unconformably not only on the
slightly older meta-sediments and meta-volcanics, but also upon the gold-bearing
shears. This scenario could produce a ‘pooling’ of mineralization underneath the
meta-andesite, with the meta-andesite acting as a physical barrier to ascending
mineral fluids. This is the third drilling target defined at Belleville.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><u>Results of Operations</u></b></p>
<p align="justify">Drilling was initiated at the Belleville project on December 5,
2011. The plan was to drill two to four angle drill holes into a pediment
covered geophysical anomaly interpreted to be a buried structure, which could be
mineralized, similar to nearby veins within the exposed mountain range. The
first hole, drilled at -45 degrees using an RC rig, was lost after drilling 120
feet of alluvium. A second hole at -60 degrees was attempted and was also lost
before reaching bedrock. Upon encountering unexpectedly thick alluvium
(“gravel”), the company contracted an expert in reverse circulation mud drilling
to supervise the drilling of the IP target and brought in special equipment to
facilitate placing casing through the gravel. Following this work, we again
attempted to drill the IP target in January, 2012 with a mud rotary hole being
attempted. After a number of problems 90 feet of casing was finally installed. A
tricone bit was then used to extend the hole to avoid the heavy vibration caused
by a hammer bit. Initially this was successful down to 200 feet where the hole
remained in gravel. Caving again became a problem and to avoid losing the entire
drill string the hole was abandoned at 235 feet.</p>
<p align="justify">The single deepest hole drilled at Belleville was logged and
sent for geochemical analysis to check for possible alluvial gold. Anomalous
gold ranging from 0.04 to 0.08 g/t was detected from 65 to 70 feet, 190 to 200
feet and 225 to 230 feet. Although these values are anomalous they are far below
what would be considered ore grade mineralization.</p>
<p align="justify">At this time no further work on the IP target is planned given
the unstable nature of the alluvium. Additional drilling methods will be studied
before considering further testing. All American Gold plans to review other
targets on the property for future exploration with its technical team. Minquest
and TAC along with our engineers are reviewing the property to determine
alternate drilling locations or a method of avoiding the alluvium and being able
to continue to be able to drill the planned target. We do not expect a decision
on the method of attack until some time in 2013. TAC has agreed to postpone our
obligation to make further payments on the property by one year, to delay the
2012 exploration program until at least May 31, 2013, and to extend the option
agreement by one full year.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><u>Goldfield West Property</u></b></p>
</div><div class="pagination__item">
<!--$$/page=--><a name="page_16"></a>
<p align="right">16</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Location and Access</u></p>
<p align="justify">The Goldfield West Property is an advanced exploration property
with defined targets comprised of 105 unpatented mining claims covering a total
of 850 hectares, or 2100 acres. The property is located approximately 3.5 hours
northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, by car, and approximately 3 miles west of the
town of Goldfield. The Goldfield West property is accessible by well-graded dirt
roads.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="form10kx16x1.jpg"/></p> <br/>
<p align="justify"><i>Figure 2, General Location of Goldfield West Property –
Nevada</i></p>
<p align="justify"><u>Mineralization</u></p>
<p align="justify">Geologically, the Goldfield West property encompasses an area
of Tertiary volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks. The USGS (US Geological Survey)
and several mineral exploration companies hypothesize that the western edge of a
caldera rim runs through the property. Historic work conducted has led to the
completion of 138 drill holes. Combined geophysical surveys, geochemical
sampling and 23 reverse circulation drill holes within the Nevada Eagle and
South targets have tended to confirm the existence of a gold-bearing
hydrothermal system associated with the argillization and silification of host
rocks proximal to feeder structures.</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Results of Operations and Plan of Operation</u></p>
<p align="justify">Drilling was initiated on September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2011,
using a reverse circulation (RC) drill rig. A total of five angled RC holes
totaling 3,510 feet were drilled. Two east-west fences of two holes each were
drilled in the South target (See Figure 1 below) attempting to identify major
feeder faults interpreted from geophysical surveys conducted over the area. The
two fences are 300 feet apart. A fifth hole was drilled 4,500 feet north near a
historic hole containing a significant thickness of anomalous gold.</p>
<p align="justify">Four near-vertical feeder faults were identified in the three
sections drilled (See Figures 2, 3 and 4 below). Faults were identified by
intervals containing much higher silver values than those within the
volcaniclastic hosted gold/silver zones. Volcaniclastic hosted mineralization
spread from these feeders. It is hypothesized that densely welded tuffaceous
rocks at depth are brittle enough to form openings in which high-grade veins might form. The targets identified can easily be tested
with angle RC holes which will need to be approximately 1,500 feet in depth.</p>
</div><div class="pagination__item">
<!--$$/page=--><a name="page_17"></a>
<p align="right">17</p>
<p align="justify">Drill holes GFW1101 and 1102 were drilled on Section 83300N
(Feet North) on the same section as GFW1002C, a steeply dipping core hole
drilled in 2010 which defined the stratigraphy of the area and contained
numerous +0.01 g/t gold intercepts with some quartz/sulfide veining. GFW1101
intersected 10 feet of 0.17 g/t gold and 18.6 g/t silver at 140-150 feet. The
hole has an additional 160 feet total thickness of +0.10 g/t gold, but no other
high silver grades. This intercept appears to be a north-south trending steeply
west dipping feeder fault. The association of high silver with or without gold
in feeder faults was discovered while drilling the Nevada Eagle vein extension
several years ago. Brittle rocks occur roughly 900 to 1,100 feet below the
surface on Section 83300N and where the interpreted fault crosses these rocks is
a high-grade vein target.</p>
<p align="justify">Drill holes GFW1103 and 1104 were drilled on Section 83500N.
GWF1103 contained two high silver intervals, postulated to be two feeder faults.
From 215 to 225 feet the hole assays 13.3 g/t silver and from 320 t0 330 feet
assays 25.1 g/t Ag. GFW1004 contains 36.7 g/t silver from 215-220 feet. These
three interpreted faults were given the same orientation as those on Section
83300N. Again, brittle rocks occur roughly 900 to 1,100 feet below the surface
and where the interpreted faults cross these rocks are high-grade vein targets.
Geochemical results for all five holes using a 0.10 g/t gold equivalent (AuEq)
cut off are shown in the table below.</p>
<p align="justify">GFW1105 was drilled on Section 87900N in an area where a
historic vertical drill hole (MZ4) had intersected a thick section of anomalous
gold. This hole intersected 0.65 g/t gold and 28.7 g/t silver from 170 to 180
feet. This indicated feeder fault was interpreted as parallel to the feeder
faults further south and the target depth is interpreted as the same.</p>
<p align="justify">The results show thick sections of nearly flat-lying
volcaniclastic hosted gold/silver mineralization with values averaging 0.3 to
0.5 g/t AuEq with infrequent near vertical feeder faults as shown by high silver
values. While the flat-lying mineralization is not currently economic the
extensive volume of mineralization indicates major feeder faults were active in
the area.</p>
<p align="justify">For the first time feeder faults have been identified at the
South Target. The projection of these feeder faults into brittle rocks at depth
defines several high-grade vein targets. Four such targets have been defined by
this latest drilling program. The company will continue to assess the latest
data to define targets for a third phase of drilling which is expected to
commence in the late summer of 2012. TAC has postponed the requirement of the
Option Agreement that requires the property expenditure payment be made on
January 20, 2012, until September 20, 2012, or until such time as they are
prepared to made specific recommendations as to an exploration program for the
current year.</p>

<p align="justify"><b><u>Iowa Canyon Property</u></b></p>
<p align="justify">We held a right of first refusal on an additional exploration
property called the “Iowa Canyon” property in Lander County, Nevada through to
September 8, 2012. The Iowa Canyon property represents a nearly untested
exploration opportunity. Recent exploration efforts have discovered multiple
episodes of precious metals mineralization over a district-wide scale. Gold is
hosted in a variety of rock types including silicified Tertiary volcanic and
volcanoclastic sediments, quartz veins, quartz stockwork zones, carbon-rich
Paleozoic sediments, and as jasperoid replacements of lower plate calcareous
sediments.</p>
<p align="justify">Drilling had identified gold and silver jasperoids within upper
and lower plate sediments, as well as gold and molybdenum-rich porphyry dikes. A
single drill hole on the western side of the property contains up to 800 parts
per million (ppm) molybdenum and 0.2 grams per ton gold over ten foot widths.
The lower plate Hanson Creek Formation, a favorable host rock for Carlin style
mineralization, has been identified in outcrop as well as drilling on the north,
east and west portions of the Iowa Canyon Property.</p>

<p align="justify">The Bell Flats Project is comprised of 14 unpatented mining
claims covering a total of 280 acres within the Nevada mining district,
Churchill County, Nevada and is located approximately 5 miles north of Gabbs,
Nevada and 25 miles north of the Paradise Peak mine. This project represents an
advanced stage exploration property with no defined resource. Extensive soil and
rock sampling, geophysical surveys and drilling have identified several
alteration zones along a corridor approximately 3,500 meters in length. Gold and
silver occur developed along the contact of jasperoid and argillized Tertiary
volcanic rock intermittently along the corridor. The mineralization has been
encountered from surface to depths of 160 meters in drilling. Gold values exceed
5.1 g/t in trenching while silver values reach 200 g/t from historic drilling.
The mineralized zone is open in all directions. A “Santa Fe type” model is
indicated for the project based on the geology and alteration. </p>

<p align="justify">Operating expenses for the year ended May 31, 2012, increased
by approximately 408% compared to the similar period in 2011 largely due to the
underlying potential cost of the issuance of option stock under a consulting
agreement with an executive officer which amounted to a charge of $1,000,000.
Without this charge, the increase relative to the previous year would only have
been approximately 163%. During the past year we continued our business plan,
completed the first phases of the exploration programs on both the Goldfield
West and Belleville properties and made due diligence enquiries on two other
projects in Nevada as well as elected not to proceed with the Iowa Canyon
option. Investor relations and related services fees and costs were incurred to
allow us to make All American more visible to potential investors.</p>
<p align="justify">During the year ended May 31, 2012, All American incurred

the management fee category is taken out) as compared to $407,884 for the prior
year and a total of $2,206,704 for the period from inception on May 17, 2006, to

in the past two years pertaining to the phase I exploration program on our
optioned exploration property in China, the Gao Feng gold property. Since
inception on May 17, 2006, we have incurred a total of $20,000 in resource
property exploration expenses in China. This cost category will have no further
costs incurred in the future.</p>
<p align="justify">GOLDFIELD WEST EXPLORATION AND ACQUISITION EXPENSES: $172,944
in exploration costs relating to the first phase of the exploration program on
the property during the past year on the Goldfield West property. For the year
ended May 31, 2011, $303,870 was spent on the property ($300,000 in acquisition
costs and an additional $3,087 for miscellaneous costs associated with the
exploration of the property). For the period May 17, 2006 (inception), through
May 31, 2012, All American has incurred $476,814 in total on expenses in the
acquisition of the agreement and initial exploration costs on the Goldfields
West property. </p>
<p align="justify">BELLEVILLE EXPLORATION AND ACQUISITION EXPENSES: $102,626 was

paid in the current year as part of the exploration ($7,010) or acquisition
($50,000) expenses of the Iowa Canyon property option in Nevada and no such

(inception) through May 31, 2012, All American has incurred $57,010 in total on
expenses in the acquisition or the exploration of the Iowa Canyon property. On
January 12, 2012, the Board of Directors decided not to proceed further with the
Iowa Canyon property at this time. The decision was made to instead focus our
resources on our two primary targets – the Belleville and Goldfield West
projects. At this point there will be no further expenditures made in regards to
the Iowa Canyon property.</p>
<p align="justify">BANKING AND RELATED CHARGES: $758 in banking and related
charges were incurred in the current fiscal year while $753 was incurred for the

incurred a total of $1,233 in losses on currency exchange. </p>
<p align="justify">IMPUTED INTEREST EXPENSE – Prior to the current year, a former
officer and director had advanced $20,000 in the form of a non-interest bearing
promissory note and a non-related party had advanced $10,500 in the form of a
non-interest bearing loan. An imputed interest of $1,525 was, therefore, deemed
to have been incurred in the current fiscal year ended on May 31, 2012, which
was calculated using an interest rate of 5% (five percent) which is the interest
rate that was payable on comparable notes and advances that we have recently
incurred. No such imputed expenses were incurred for the year ended May 31,
2011. For the period May 17, 2006 (inception), through May 31, 2012, All
American has incurred a total of $1,525 on imputed interest expenses.</p>
<p align="justify">INTEREST EXPENSE – PROMISSORY NOTES AND ADVANCES: During fiscal
2011 - 2012 a director, through a wholly owned corporation loaned $30,000 to All
American in the form of a promissory note which bears interest at the rate of 5%
and is due and payable on April 30, 2012; although the note was is currently
due, the payee has agreed not to call the note especially in light of the
repayment of $20,000 that was made during the year. Interest costs of $869
regarding notes payable and advances from officers and other related parties
which had been arranged in prior fiscal years as well as the referenced advance
were incurred in the current fiscal year; $1,000 was incurred for the period

<p align="justify">INTEREST EXPENSE – CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE: On November 10, 2011,
the Corporation issued $355,000 in a non-interest bearing convertible debentures
to a single creditor in exchange for cash proceeds used to make the payment due
to TAC under the Goldfields agreement in the amount of $300,000 as well as
$55,000 which was allocated to working capital. All or any portion of the
amounts due under the convertible notes, which mature on August 23, 2015, may be
converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into common shares of the
Corporation at a conversion price of seventy five percent (75%) of the average
closing bid prices for the ten trading days immediately preceding the date that
the Corporation receives notice of conversion of the convertible notes. In
accordance with ASC 470-20, the Corporation determined that there was a
beneficial conversion feature on the convertible notes with an intrinsic value
of $118,500. The Corporation recorded $118,500 as additional paid-in capital and
reduced the carrying value of the convertible notes to $237,000. The carrying
values of the convertible notes are to be accreted over the term of the
convertible notes up to their face value of $355,500. The debenture was
converted to shares on July 13, 2011. During the year ended May 31, 2012, the

<p align="justify">LOSS ON CONVERSION OF DEBENTURE: Based on the terms of the
above noted convertible debenture agreement we should have issued 765,027 shares
but over allotted the number of shares to be issued (875,000) through an error
in calculating the closing price as stipulated under the agreement. The value of
those over allotted shares (109,973 shares) was $71,996 which is reflected in
the financial statements as being a loss on the conversion and recorded in the
statements as such. $0 (nil) in losses on conversion of debts was incurred for

<p align="justify">As at May 31, 2012, we had a working capital deficit of
$30,947. We plan to raise the additional capital required to meet the balance of
our estimated funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily through
private placements of our stock or prospectus offerings, loans or advances from
officers, directors and shareholders and the possible sale of part of our
interest in our mineral properties. We do not anticipate that we will be able to
satisfy any of these funding requirements internally until we significantly
increase revenues.</p>
<p align="justify">There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern because our business is dependent upon obtaining further
financing. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a
significant dilution in the equity interests of current stockholders. Obtaining
commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our
liabilities and future cash commitments. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Future Financings</b></p>
<p align="justify">We will require additional financing in order to enable us to
proceed with our plan of operations, as discussed above in order to continue
operations. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be
obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the
additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other
obligations as they become due. We are pursuing various alternatives to meet our
immediate and long-term financial requirements.</p>
</div><div class="pagination__item">
<!--$$/page=--><a name="page_25"></a>
<p align="right">25</p>
<p align="justify">We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common
stock in order to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares
will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we
will achieve any additional sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or
other financing to fund our planned business activities.</p>
<p align="justify">We presently do not have any arrangements for additional
financing and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently
available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Contractual Obligations</b></p>
<p align="justify">As a “smaller reporting company” we are not required to provide
tabular disclosure obligations.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Going Concern</b></p>
<p align="justify">We are in the exploration stage, have not yet achieved
profitable operations and are dependent on our ability to raise capital from
stockholders or other sources to meet obligations arising from normal business
operations when they become due. Therefore, in their report on our audited
financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2012, our independent auditors
included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to
continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note
disclosure describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</b></p>
<p align="justify">We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
stockholders.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Critical Accounting Policies</b></p>
<p align="justify">The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected
by management’s application of accounting policies. We believe that
understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved
with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an
understanding of our financial statements.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Functional Currency<br/></i>The Company’s functional currency
is the United States dollar.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Cash and Cash Equivalents<br/></i>The Company considers all
highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when
acquired to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at May 31,
2012.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Financial Instruments <br/></i>At May 31, 2012, the fair
value of the Company’s financial instruments approximate their carrying value
based on their terms and interest rates.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Mineral Interests<br/></i>Mineral interest acquisition costs
include cash consideration and the estimated fair value of common shares issued
for mineral properties, based on recent share issuances. Exploration and
development expenditures are expensed in the period incurred until such time as the
Company establishes the existence of commercial feasibility, at which time these
costs will be deferred. Administrative expenditures are expensed in the period
incurred. Mineral interest acquisition costs and related interest and financing
costs may be deferred until the property is placed into production, sold or
abandoned. Mineral interest acquisition costs will be deferred only when and if
proven and probable reserves have been found to exist. No proven or probable
reserves are currently known to exist. Any deferred costs will be amortized on a
unit-of-production basis over the estimated proven and probable reserves of the
property following commencement of commercial production or written off if the
property is sold, allowed to lapse or abandoned.</p>
</div><div class="pagination__item">
<!--$$/page=--><a name="page_26"></a>
<p align="right">26</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Earnings (Loss) per Common Share<br/></i>The Company computes
net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic “<i>Earnings per
Share”</i>. The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding; basic loss per
share excludes the impact of common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per
share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
the period using the “as if converted” basis, i.e., it utilizes the average
market price per share when applying the treasury stock method in determining
common stock equivalents. For the year ended May 31, 2012, and for the period
May 17, 2006 (date of inception), through May 31, 2012, there were no variances
between the basic and diluted loss per share as there were no potential dilutive
securities.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Income Taxes<br/></i>The Company has adopted ASC Topic
“<i>Accounting for Income Taxes” </i>as of inception. The Company recognizes
deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates
and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to
be recovered. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of
such assets to be more likely than not.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Foreign Currency Translation<br/></i>The Company’s functional
and reporting currency is the United States dollar and where necessary the
accounts of the Company’s foreign operations have been translated into United
States dollars in accordance with ASC Topic “<i>Foreign Currency
Translation</i>”. Assets and liabilities of those operations are translated in
U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date; income and
expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting
period. Translation adjustments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss), a separate component of shareholders’ deficit.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Fair Value of financial Instruments.<br/></i>ASC disclosures
about fair value of financial instruments define the fair value of a financial
instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties. The carrying values of the Company’s
financial instruments, which include cash, accounts receivable, and accrued
expenses, approximate fair values due to the short-term maturities of such
instruments.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
Statements.<br/></i>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from those estimates and assumptions.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Recently Adopted and Enacted Accounting
Pronouncements</b></p>
<p align="justify">In June 2009, ASC Topic “<i>The FASB Accounting Standards
Codification(TM) and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles –
A Replacement of FASB Statement No. 162</i>” was issued. This standard
establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification(TM) (the “Codification”)
as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to
be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
GAAP. The Codification does not change current US GAAP, but is intended to
simplify user access to all authoritative US GAAP by providing all the
authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place.</p>
</div><div class="pagination__item">
<!--$$/page=--><a name="page_27"></a>
<p align="right">27</p>
<p align="justify">The Codification is effective for interim and annual periods
ending after September 15, 2009, and as of the effective date, all existing
accounting standard documents were superseded. The Codification is effective in
the second quarter of the year ending May 31, 2010, and accordingly, the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2010, and all subsequent public
filings will reference the Codification as the sole source of authoritative
literature. All guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of
authority. The Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and
reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature
not included in the Codification is non-authoritative. The FASB will not issue
new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues
Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates
(“ASUs”). The FASB will not consider ASUs as authoritative in their own right.
ASUs will serve only to update the Codification, provide background information
about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on the change(s) in the
Codification. References made to FASB guidance throughout these consolidated
financials have been updated for the Codification. </p>
<p align="justify">In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, “Comprehensive
Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income”, which is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. ASU 2011-05 will
become effective for the Company on December 1, 2012. This guidance eliminates
the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of
the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. In addition, items of other
comprehensive income that are reclassified to profit or loss are required to be
presented separately on the face of the financial statements. This guidance is
intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial
statements by requiring that such amounts be presented either in a single
continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in
consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income. The adoption of ASU
2011-05 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations.</p>
<p align="justify">In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-13, "Compensation—Stock
Compensation (Topic 718) - Effect of Denominating the Exercise Price of a
Share-Based Payment Award in the Currency of the Market in Which the Underlying
Equity Security Trades (A consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)"
(“ASU 2010-13”). ASU 2010-13 clarifies that a share-based payment award with an
exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial
portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to
contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition.
Therefore, such an award should not be classified as a liability if it otherwise
qualifies as equity. This clarification of existing practice is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or
after December 15, 2010, with early application permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact of this ASU; however, we do not expect the adoption of
this ASU to have a material impact on our financial statements.</p>
<p align="justify">In May 2009, ASC Topic 855, “<i>Subsequent Events</i>” was
issued which established principles and requirements for evaluating and
reporting subsequent events and distinguishes which subsequent events should be
recognized in the financial statements versus which subsequent events should be
disclosed in the financial statements. ASC Topic 855 was effective for interim
periods ending after June 15, 2009. Because it impacts the disclosure
requirements, not the accounting treatment for subsequent events, the adoption
of ASC Topic 855 did not impact our consolidated results of operations or
financial condition. In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09
“<i>Subsequent Events (ASC Topic 855) “Amendments to Certain Recognition and
Disclosure Requirements</i>” (“ASU No. 2010-09”) which requires an entity that
is an SEC filer to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the
financial statements are issued. The adoption did not have an impact on the
Company’s financial position and results of operations. See Note 8 for
disclosures regarding subsequent events.</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Recently Issued Accounting Standards</u></p>
</div><div class="pagination__item">
<!--$$/page=--><a name="page_28"></a>
<p align="right">28</p>
<p align="justify">In August 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting
standards related to the measurement of liabilities that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. This standard clarifies how a
company should measure the fair value of liabilities and that restrictions
preventing the transfer of a liability should not be considered as a factor in
the measurement of liabilities within the scope of this standard. This standard
was effective for the Company on October 1, 2010. The Company does not expect
the impact of its adoption to be material to its financial statements.</p>
<p align="justify">In October 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting
standards related to the accounting for revenue in arrangements with multiple
deliverables including how the arrangement consideration is allocated among
delivered and undelivered items of the arrangement. Among the amendments, this
standard eliminated the use of the residual method for allocating arrangement
considerations and requires an entity to allocate the overall consideration to
each deliverable based on an estimated selling price of each individual
deliverable in the arrangement in the absence of having vendor-specific
objective evidence or other third party evidence of fair value of the
undelivered items. This standard also provides further guidance on how to
determine a separate unit of accounting in a multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangement and expands the disclosure requirements about the judgments made in
applying the estimated selling price method and how those judgments affect the
timing or amount of revenue recognition. This standard will become effective for
the Company on January 1, 2012. The Company does not expect the impact of its
adoption to be material to its financial statements.</p>

<p align="center"><b>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
  FIRM</b></p>
<p align="justify">To the Board of Directors <br/>
  All American Gold Corp. <br/>
  (An
  Exploration Stage Company)</p>
<p align="justify">We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of All American
  Gold Corp. (an Exploration Stage Company) as of May 31, 2012 and May 31, 2011,
  and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity
  (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. The financial statements for
  the period May 17, 2006 (inception), through May 31, 2008, were audited by other
  auditors whose reports expressed unqualified opinions on those statements. The
  financial statements for the period May 16, 2006 (inception), through May 31,
  2012, include total revenues of $0 and a net loss of $2,205,179. Our opinion on
  the statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for
  the period May 17, 2006 (inception), through May 31, 2008, insofar as it relates
  to amounts for prior periods through May 31, 2008, is based solely on the
  reports of other auditors. These financial statements are the responsibility of
  the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
  financial statements based on our audit.</p>
<p align="justify">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
  whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
  is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
  internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
  internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
  expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
  over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
  includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
  disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
  used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
  overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
  reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<p align="justify">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
  present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of All American
  Gold Corp. as of May 31, 2012, and 2011, and the results of its operations,
  changes in stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for the periods
  described above in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
  the United States of America.</p>
<p align="justify">The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
  assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
  1 to the financial statements, the Company has insufficient working capital,
  which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
  Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 1. The
  financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
  outcome of this uncertainty.</p>

<p align="justify">The Codification is effective for interim and annual periods

  accounting standard documents were superseded. The Codification is effective in
  the second quarter of the year ending May 31, 2010, and accordingly, the Annual
  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2010, and all subsequent public
  filings will reference the Codification as the sole source of authoritative
  literature. All guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of
  authority. The Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and
  reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature
  not included in the Codification is non-authoritative. The FASB will not issue
  new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues
  Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates
  (“ASUs”). The FASB will not consider ASUs as authoritative in their own right.
  ASUs will serve only to update the Codification, provide background information
  about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on the change(s) in the
  Codification. References made to FASB guidance throughout these consolidated
  financials have been updated for the Codification. </p>
<p align="justify">In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, “Comprehensive
  Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income”, which is effective
  for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. ASU 2011-05 will
  become effective for the Company on December 1, 2012. This guidance eliminates
  the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of
  the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. In addition, items of other
  comprehensive income that are reclassified to profit or loss are required to be
  presented separately on the face of the financial statements. This guidance is
  intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial
  statements by requiring that such amounts be presented either in a single
  continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in
  consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income. The adoption of ASU
  2011-05 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or
  results of operations.</p>
<p align="justify">In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-13, "Compensation—Stock
  Compensation (Topic 718) - Effect of Denominating the Exercise Price of a
  Share-Based Payment Award in the Currency of the Market in Which the Underlying
  Equity Security Trades (A consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)"
  (“ASU 2010-13”). ASU 2010-13 clarifies that a share-based payment award with an
  exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial
  portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to
  contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition.
  Therefore, such an award should not be classified as a liability if it otherwise
  qualifies as equity. This clarification of existing practice is effective for
  fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or
  after December 15, 2010, with early application permitted. We are currently
  evaluating the impact of this ASU; however, we do not expect the adoption of
  this ASU to have a material impact on our financial statements.</p>

  entity at the beginning of its first fiscal quarter beginning after June 15,
  2010. Early adoption is permitted at the beginning of each entity’s first fiscal quarter beginning after issuance of this Update. The
  Company does not expect the provisions of ASU 2010-11 to have a material effect
  on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the

  about postretirement benefit plan assets. This ASU is effective for interim and

  raised by preparers, auditors and members of the legal profession on initial
  recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting and
  disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
  combination. ASC 805-10 is effective for assets or liabilities arising from
  contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
  after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
  December 15, 2008. ASC 805-10 will have an impact on our accounting for any
  future acquisitions and its consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p align="justify">In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-05, “<i>Measuring
  Liabilities at Fair Value</i>”, which provides additional guidance on how
  companies should measure liabilities at fair value under ASC 820. The ASU
  clarifies that the quoted price for an identical liability should be used.
  However, if such information is not available, an entity may use the quoted
  price of an identical liability when traded as an asset, quoted prices for
  similar liabilities or similar liabilities traded as assets, or another
  valuation technique (such as the market or income approach). The ASU also
  indicates that the fair value of a liability is not adjusted to reflect the
  impact of contractual restrictions that prevent its transfer and indicates
  circumstances in which quoted prices for an identical liability or quoted price
  for an identical liability traded as an asset may be considered level 1 fair
  value measurements and was effective October 1, 2010. We would not expect it to
  have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
  condition. </p>

  delivered and undelivered items of the arrangement. Among the amendments, this
  standard eliminated the use of the residual method for allocating arrangement
  considerations and requires an entity to allocate the overall consideration to
  each deliverable based on an estimated selling price of each individual
  deliverable in the arrangement in the absence of having vendor-specific
  objective evidence or other third party evidence of fair value of the
  undelivered items. This standard also provides further guidance on how to
  determine a separate unit of accounting in a multiple-deliverable revenue
  arrangement and expands the disclosure requirements about the judgments made in
  applying the estimated selling price method and how those judgments affect the
  timing or amount of revenue recognition. This standard will become effective for
  the Company on January 1, 2012. The Company does not expect the impact of its
  adoption to be material to its financial statements.</p>

<p align="justify">The Essex Project is comprised of 18 unpatented mining claims
  covering a total of 360 acres within the Nevada mining district, White Pine
  County, Nevada and is located approximately 10 miles southeast of Ely, Nevada.
  This project represents an advanced stage exploration property with no defined
  resource. However, drilling on roughly 400 feet centers with significant
  underground workings have identified a mineralized zone approximately 4,500 feet
  in length and open in both directions. The project area encompasses a
  northwesterly trending structural zone which can be followed along strike for
  over 2,500 meters. The structure cuts Devonian Guillemette limestone,
  Devonian/Mississippian Pilot shale, Mississippian Joana limestone, and
  Mississippian Chainman shale which are the host rocks in the “Alligator Ridge”
  district. Workings and drill holes have encountered gold and silver within a
  jasperoid developed along Joana-Chainman contact zone where it plunges to the
  west. The mineralization has been followed to depths of 700 feet in historic
  workings. </p>
<p align="justify">Historic work in the area was initiated as early as 1869 when a
  minor amount of silver was produced. Production started again in the early
  1900’s when manganese ore was shipped. </p>
<p align="justify">Recent exploration includes 2 holes by Newmont in 1978, 7 holes
  by Homestake in 1980, and 26 holes by Echo Bay from 1988 to 1989. This work
  defines a corridor of gold and silver mineralization trending northwesterly for
  over 2,500 meters. The zone is lost under alluvial cover to the southeast and
  northwest, but appears to continue based on CSMT surveys conducted by Cominco in
  1996.</p>
<p align="justify">Desert Pacific believes the property shares similarities with
  Alligator Ridge and has gold mining potential. Targets within the Pilot Shale,
  the main host for Alligator Ridge ore deposits, remain untested.</p>
<p align="justify">On May 7, 2012, we entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent
  (the “Desert Pacific ‘Bell Flats’ LOI”) with Desert Pacific Exploration, Inc.
  (“Desert Pacific”) that set out the general terms and conditions between Desert
  Pacific and the Corporation for the “Bell Flats” mineral property located in
  Churchill County, Nevada, which allowed us to exclusively investigate the
  mineral property for a forty-five (45) day period until June 22, 2012, and
  whereby the Corporation has an exclusive right to enter into a mining option
  agreement with Desert Pacific at any time prior to June 22, 2012. In
  consideration of signing the Letter of Intent, we paid to Desert Pacific sum of
  $2,500 concurrently with the execution and delivery of the LOI. </p>
<p align="justify">The Bell Flats Project is comprised of 14 unpatented mining
  claims covering a total of 280 acres within the Nevada mining district,
  Churchill County, Nevada and is located approximately 5 miles north of Gabbs,
  Nevada and 25 miles north of the Paradise Peak mine. This project represents an
  advanced stage exploration property with no defined resource. Extensive soil and
  rock sampling, geophysical surveys and drilling have identified several
  alteration zones along a corridor approximately 3,500 meters in length. Gold and
  silver occur developed along the contact of jasperoid and argillized Tertiary
  volcanic rock intermittently along the corridor. The mineralization has been
  encountered from surface to depths of 160 meters in drilling. Gold values exceed
  5.1 g/t in trenching while silver values reach 200 g/t from historic drilling.
  The mineralized zone is open in all directions. A “Santa Fe type” model is
  indicated for the project based on the geology and alteration. </p>
<p align="justify">The project area encompasses a northwesterly trending
  structural zone. The structure cuts Tertiary felsic volcanic rocks and Triassic
  sediments which are the host rocks at the nearby Santa Fe gold-silver deposits.
  Alteration as jasperoid follows the contact of the Triassic limestone and
  Tertiary volcanic rocks. Shallow pits, trenches and drill holes have encountered
  gold and silver within argillized shale and jasperoid developed along this contact and within a clay altered felsic volcanic. Altered
  rocks are capped by post-mineral basalt and wind-blown sand. </p>

  with Desert Pacific and our Board of Directors. After reviewing all of the
  available data our engineers advised that there was insufficient merit to the

  agreement with Desert Pacific to explore the project. As a result, All American
  has no further obligations under the Letters of Intent on either project.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>NOTE 7 – INCOME TAXES</b></p>
<p align="justify">The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
  liability method prescribed by ASC Topic “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This
  approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
  expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between
  the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
  assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be
  applicable to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
  are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
  liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
  includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary
  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. </p>
<p align="justify">In addition, effective June 1, 2007, the Company adopted ASC
  740-10, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the
  criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the
  benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s financial statements.
  ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not, and a
  measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a
  tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial
  statements. The Company did not record any transition adjustment as a result of
  the adoption of ASC 740-10. </p>
<p align="justify">The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related
  to potential liability for uncertain tax positions as a component of tax
  expense. This policy did not change as a result of the adoption of ASC 740-10.
  No penalties were recognized during fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011. </p>
<p align="justify">No provision for income taxes has been recorded due to the net
  operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately $2,206,704 as of May 31,
  2012, that will be offset against future taxable income. The available net
  operating loss carry forwards expire in various years through 2030. No tax
  benefit has been reported in the financial statements because the Corporation
  believes there is a 50% or greater chance the carry forwards will expire
  unused.</p>

Accounting and Financial Disclosure</b></p>
<p align="justify">There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope
or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods, including the
interim period up through the date the relationship ended. </p>
<p align="justify">There were no changes in our independent accountants for the
years ended May 30, 2012, and 2011.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Item 9A(T). Controls and Procedures</b></p>
<p align="justify">We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive officer (our president) and our principal accounting and
financial officer (our chief financial officer and treasurer) to allow for
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our
disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our
management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. </p>
<p align="justify">Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or
our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and fraud.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of a control system
are met. Further, any control system reflects limitations on resources and the
benefits of a control system must be considered relative to its costs. These
limitations also include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a
control. A design of a control system is also based upon certain assumptions
about potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
may not be detected.</p>
<p align="justify">As of May 31, 2012, the year end period covered by this report,
we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president and
chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. </p>
<p align="justify">There have been no significant changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended May 31,
2012, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal controls over financial reporting.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting</b></p>
<p align="justify">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act, and assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of May 31, 2012. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We
have identified the following material weaknesses: </p>

<p align="justify">Our board of directors on April 22, 2008, adopted a formal
written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Compliance Program for all
officers, directors and senior employees. Our Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics Program was filed as an exhibit to our Form S-1 filed with the SEC on
September 05, 2008.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert</b></p>
<p align="justify">Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a
member of its audit committee that qualifies as an ‘audit committee financial
expert” as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is “independent”
as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange
Act.</p>
<p align="justify">We believe that the members of our board of directors are
collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and
understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We
believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an “audit
committee financial expert” would be overly costly and burdensome and is not
warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the
fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we
currently do not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees
performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation
or audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is
necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such
committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors.</p>
